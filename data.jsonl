This great\nFrench writer deserves to be regarded as a classic, not only in the land\nof his birth, but in all countries and in all literatures.  His Essays,\nwhich are at once the most celebrated and the most permanent of his\nproductions, form a magazine out of which such minds as those of Bacon\nand Shakespeare did not disdain to help themselves; and, indeed, as\nHallam observes, the Frenchman\u2019s literary importance largely results from\nthe share which his mind had in influencing other minds, coeval and\nsubsequent.  But, at the same time, estimating the value and rank of the\nessayist, we are not to leave out of the account the drawbacks and the\ncircumstances of the period: the imperfect state of education, the\ncomparative scarcity of books, and the limited opportunities of\nintellectual intercourse.  Montaigne freely borrowed of others, and he\nhas found men willing to borrow of him as freely.  We need not wonder at\nthe reputation which he with seeming facility achieved.  He was, without\nbeing aware of it, the leader of a new school in letters and morals.  His\nbook was different from all others which were at that date in the world.\nIt diverted the ancient currents of thought into new channels.  It told\nits readers, with unexampled frankness, what its writer\u2019s opinion was\nabout men and things, and threw what must have been a strange kind of new\nlight on many matters but darkly understood.  Above all, the essayist\nuncased himself, and made his intellectual and physical organism public\nproperty.  He took the world into his confidence on all subjects.  His\nessays were a sort of literary anatomy, where we get a diagnosis of the\nwriter\u2019s mind, made by himself at different levels and under a large\nvariety of operating influences.\n\nOf all egotists, Montaigne, if not the greatest, was the most\nfascinating, because, perhaps, he was the least affected and most\ntruthful.  What he did, and what he had professed to do, was to dissect\nhis mind, and show us, as best he could, how it was made, and what\nrelation it bore to external objects.  He investigated his mental\nstructure as a schoolboy pulls his watch to pieces, to examine the\nmechanism of the works; and the result, accompanied by illustrations\nabounding with originality and force, he delivered to his fellow-men in a\nbook.\n\nEloquence, rhetorical effect, poetry, were alike remote from his design.\nHe did not write from necessity, scarcely perhaps for fame.  But he\ndesired to leave France, nay, and the world, something to be remembered\nby, something which should tell what kind of a man he was--what he felt,\nthought, suffered--and he succeeded immeasurably, I apprehend, beyond his\nexpectations.\n\nIt was reasonable enough that Montaigne should expect for his work a\ncertain share of celebrity in Gascony, and even, as time went on,\nthroughout France; but it is scarcely probable that he foresaw how his\nrenown was to become world-wide; how he was to occupy an almost unique\nposition as a man of letters and a moralist; how the Essays would be\nread, in all the principal languages of Europe, by millions of\nintelligent human beings, who never heard of Perigord or the League, and\nwho are in doubt, if they are questioned, whether the author lived in the\nsixteenth or the eighteenth century.  This is true fame.  A man of genius\nbelongs to no period and no country.  He speaks the language of nature,\nwhich is always everywhere the same.\n\nThe text of these volumes is taken from the first edition of Cotton\u2019s\nversion, printed in 3 vols.  8vo, 1685-6, and republished in 1693, 1700,\n1711, 1738, and 1743, in the same number of volumes and the same size.\nIn the earliest impression the errors of the press are corrected merely\nas far as page 240 of the first volume, and all the editions follow one\nanother.  That of 1685-6 was the only one which the translator lived to\nsee.  He died in 1687, leaving behind him an interesting and little-known\ncollection of poems, which appeared posthumously, 8vo, 1689.\n\nIt was considered imperative to correct Cotton\u2019s translation by a careful\ncollation with the \u2018variorum\u2019 edition of the original, Paris, 1854,\n4 vols.  8vo or 12mo, and parallel passages from Florin\u2019s earlier\nundertaking have occasionally been inserted at the foot of the page.  A\nLife of the Author and all his recovered Letters, sixteen in number, have\nalso been given; but, as regards the correspondence, it can scarcely be\ndoubted that it is in a purely fragmentary state.  To do more than\nfurnish a sketch of the leading incidents in Montaigne\u2019s life seemed, in\nthe presence of Bayle St. John\u2019s charming and able biography, an attempt\nas difficult as it was useless.\n\nThe besetting sin of both Montaigne\u2019s translators seems to have been a\npropensity for reducing his language and phraseology to the language and\nphraseology of the age and country to which they belonged, and, moreover,\ninserting paragraphs and words, not here and there only, but constantly\nand habitually, from an evident desire and view to elucidate or\nstrengthen their author\u2019s meaning.  The result has generally been\nunfortunate; and I have, in the case of all these interpolations on\nCotton\u2019s part, felt bound, where I did not cancel them, to throw them\ndown into the notes, not thinking it right that Montaigne should be\nallowed any longer to stand sponsor for what he never wrote; and\nreluctant, on the other hand, to suppress the intruding matter entirely,\nwhere it appeared to possess a value of its own.\n\nNor is redundancy or paraphrase the only form of transgression in Cotton,\nfor there are places in his author which he thought proper to omit, and\nit is hardly necessary to say that the restoration of all such matter to\nthe text was considered essential to its integrity and completeness.\n\nMy warmest thanks are due to my father, Mr Registrar Hazlitt, the author\nof the well-known and excellent edition of Montaigne published in 1842,\nfor the important assistance which he has rendered to me in verifying and\nretranslating the quotations, which were in a most corrupt state, and of\nwhich Cotton\u2019s English versions were singularly loose and inexact, and\nfor the zeal with which he has co-operated with me in collating the\nEnglish text, line for line and word for word, with the best French\nedition.\n\nBy the favour of Mr F. W. Cosens, I have had by me, while at work on this\nsubject, the copy of Cotgrave\u2019s Dictionary, folio, 1650, which belonged\nto Cotton.  It has his autograph and copious MSS.  notes, nor is it too\nmuch to presume that it is the very book employed by him in his\ntranslation.\nW.  C.

This biography is the more desirable that\nit contains all really interesting and important matter in the journal of\nthe Tour in Germany and Italy, which, as it was merely written under\nMontaigne\u2019s dictation, is in the third person, is scarcely worth\npublication, as a whole, in an English dress.]\n\n\nThe author of the Essays was born, as he informs us himself, between\neleven and twelve o\u2019clock in the day, the last of February 1533, at the\nchateau of St. Michel de Montaigne.  His father, Pierre Eyquem, esquire,\nwas successively first Jurat of the town of Bordeaux (1530), Under-Mayor\n1536, Jurat for the second time in 1540, Procureur in 1546, and at\nlength Mayor from 1553 to 1556.  He was a man of austere probity, who had\n\u201ca particular regard for honour and for propriety in his person and\nattire .  .  .   a mighty good faith in his speech, and a conscience and\na religious feeling inclining to superstition, rather than to the other\nextreme.\u201d [Essays, ii. 2.]  Pierre Eyquem bestowed great care on the\neducation of his children, especially on the practical side of it.  To\nassociate closely his son Michel with the people, and attach him to those\nwho stand in need of assistance, he caused him to be held at the font by\npersons of meanest position; subsequently he put him out to nurse with a\npoor villager, and then, at a later period, made him accustom himself to\nthe most common sort of living, taking care, nevertheless, to cultivate\nhis mind, and superintend its development without the exercise of undue\nrigour or constraint.  Michel, who gives us the minutest account of his\nearliest years, charmingly narrates how they used to awake him by the\nsound of some agreeable music, and how he learned Latin, without\nsuffering the rod or shedding a tear, before beginning French, thanks to\nthe German teacher whom his father had placed near him, and who never\naddressed him except in the language of Virgil and Cicero.  The study of\nGreek took precedence.  At six years of age young Montaigne went to the\nCollege of Guienne at Bordeaux, where he had as preceptors the most\neminent scholars of the sixteenth century, Nicolas Grouchy, Guerente,\nMuret, and Buchanan.  At thirteen he had passed through all the classes,\nand as he was destined for the law he left school to study that science.\nHe was then about fourteen, but these early years of his life are\ninvolved in obscurity.  The next information that we have is that in 1554\nhe received the appointment of councillor in the Parliament of Bordeaux;\nin 1559 he was at Bar-le-Duc with the court of Francis II, and in the\nyear following he was present at Rouen to witness the declaration of the\nmajority of Charles IX.  We do not know in what manner he was engaged on\nthese occasions.\n\nBetween 1556 and 1563 an important incident occurred in the life of\nMontaigne, in the commencement of his romantic friendship with Etienne de\nla Boetie, whom he had met, as he tells us, by pure chance at some\nfestive celebration in the town.  From their very first interview the two\nfound themselves drawn irresistibly close to one another, and during six\nyears this alliance was foremost in the heart of Montaigne, as it was\nafterwards in his memory, when death had severed it.\n\nAlthough he blames severely in his own book [Essays, i.  27.] those who,\ncontrary to the opinion of Aristotle, marry before five-and-thirty,\nMontaigne did not wait for the period fixed by the philosopher of\nStagyra, but in 1566, in his thirty-third year, he espoused Francoise de\nChassaigne, daughter of a councillor in the Parliament of Bordeaux.  The\nhistory of his early married life vies in obscurity with that of his\nyouth.  His biographers are not agreed among themselves; and in the\nsame degree that he lays open to our view all that concerns his secret\nthoughts, the innermost mechanism of his mind, he observes too much\nreticence in respect to his public functions and conduct, and his social\nrelations.  The title of Gentleman in Ordinary to the King, which he\nassumes, in a preface, and which Henry II.  gives him in a letter, which\nwe print a little farther on; what he says as to the commotions of\ncourts, where he passed a portion of his life; the Instructions which he\nwrote under the dictation of Catherine de Medici for King Charles IX.,\nand his noble correspondence with Henry IV., leave no doubt, however, as\nto the part which he played in the transactions of those times, and we\nfind an unanswerable proof of the esteem in which he was held by the most\nexalted personages, in a letter which was addressed to him by Charles at\nthe time he was admitted to the Order of St. Michael, which was, as he\ninforms us himself, the highest honour of the French noblesse.\n\nAccording to Lacroix du Maine, Montaigne, upon the death of his eldest\nbrother, resigned his post of Councillor, in order to adopt the military\nprofession, while, if we might credit the President Bouhier, he never\ndischarged any functions connected with arms.  However, several passages\nin the Essays seem to indicate that he not only took service, but that he\nwas actually in numerous campaigns with the Catholic armies.  Let us add,\nthat on his monument he is represented in a coat of mail, with his casque\nand gauntlets on his right side, and a lion at his feet, all which\nsignifies, in the language of funeral emblems, that the departed has been\nengaged in some important military transactions.\n\nHowever it may be as to these conjectures, our author, having arrived at\nhis thirty-eighth year, resolved to dedicate to study and contemplation\nthe remaining term of his life; and on his birthday, the last of February\n1571, he caused a philosophical inscription, in Latin, to be placed upon\none of the walls of his chateau, where it is still to be seen, and of\nwhich the translation is to this effect:--\u201cIn the year of Christ .  .  .\nin his thirty-eighth year, on the eve of the Calends of March, his\nbirthday, Michel Montaigne, already weary of court employments and public\nhonours, withdrew himself entirely into the converse of the learned\nvirgins where he intends to spend the remaining moiety of the to allotted\nto him in tranquil seclusion.\u201d\n\nAt the time to which we have come, Montaigne was unknown to the world of\nletters, except as a translator and editor.  In 1569 he had published a\ntranslation of the \u201cNatural Theology\u201d of Raymond de Sebonde, which he had\nsolely undertaken to please his father.  In 1571 he had caused to be\nprinted at Paris certain \u2018opuscucla\u2019 of Etienne de la Boetie; and these\ntwo efforts, inspired in one case by filial duty, and in the other by\nfriendship, prove that affectionate motives overruled with him mere\npersonal ambition as a literary man.  We may suppose that he began to\ncompose the Essays at the very outset of his retirement from public\nengagements; for as, according to his own account, observes the President\nBouhier, he cared neither for the chase, nor building, nor gardening, nor\nagricultural pursuits, and was exclusively occupied with reading and\nreflection, he devoted himself with satisfaction to the task of setting\ndown his thoughts just as they occurred to him.  Those thoughts became a\nbook, and the first part of that book, which was to confer immortality on\nthe writer, appeared at Bordeaux in 1580.  Montaigne was then\nfifty-seven; he had suffered for some years past from renal colic and\ngravel; and it was with the necessity of distraction from his pain, and\nthe hope of deriving relief from the waters, that he undertook at this\ntime a great journey.  As the account which he has left of his travels in\nGermany and Italy comprises some highly interesting particulars of his\nlife and personal history, it seems worth while to furnish a sketch or\nanalysis of it.\n\n\u201cThe Journey, of which we proceed to describe the course simply,\u201d says\nthe editor of the Itinerary, \u201chad, from Beaumont-sur-Oise to Plombieres,\nin Lorraine, nothing sufficiently interesting to detain us .  .  .  we\nmust go as far, as Basle, of which we have a description, acquainting us\nwith its physical and political condition at that period, as well as with\nthe character of its baths.  The passage of Montaigne through Switzerland\nis not without interest, as we see there how our philosophical traveller\naccommodated himself everywhere to the ways of the country.  The hotels,\nthe provisions, the Swiss cookery, everything, was agreeable to him; it\nappears, indeed, as if he preferred to the French manners and tastes\nthose of the places he was visiting, and of which the simplicity and\nfreedom (or frankness) accorded more with his own mode of life and\nthinking.  In the towns where he stayed, Montaigne took care to see the\nProtestant divines, to make himself conversant with all their dogmas.  He\neven had disputations with them occasionally.\n\n\u201cHaving left Switzerland he went to Isne, an imperial then on to Augsburg\nand Munich.  He afterwards proceeded to the Tyrol, where he was agreeably\nsurprised, after the warnings which he had received, at the very slight\ninconveniences which he suffered, which gave him occasion to remark that\nhe had all his life distrusted the statements of others respecting\nforeign countries, each person\u2019s tastes being according to the notions of\nhis native place; and that he had consequently set very little on what he\nwas told beforehand.\n\n\u201cUpon his arrival at Botzen, Montaigne wrote to Francois Hottmann, to say\nthat he had been so pleased with his visit to Germany that he quitted it\nwith great regret, although it was to go into Italy.  He then passed\nthrough Brunsol, Trent, where he put up at the Rose; thence going to\nRovera; and here he first lamented the scarcity of crawfish, but made up\nfor the loss by partaking of truffles cooked in oil and vinegar; oranges,\ncitrons, and olives, in all of which he delighted.\u201d\n\nAfter passing a restless night, when he bethought himself in the morning\nthat there was some new town or district to be seen, he rose, we are\ntold, with alacrity and pleasure.\n\nHis secretary, to whom he dictated his Journal, assures us that he never\nsaw him take so much interest in surrounding scenes and persons, and\nbelieves that the complete change helped to mitigate his sufferings in\nconcentrating his attention on other points.  When there was a complaint\nmade that he had led his party out of the beaten route, and then returned\nvery near the spot from which they started, his answer was that he had no\nsettled course, and that he merely proposed to himself to pay visits to\nplaces which he had not seen, and so long as they could not convict him\nof traversing the same path twice, or revisiting a point already seen, he\ncould perceive no harm in his plan.  As to Rome, he cared less to go\nthere, inasmuch as everybody went there; and he said that he never had a\nlacquey who could not tell him all about Florence or Ferrara.  He also\nwould say that he seemed to himself like those who are reading some\npleasant story or some fine book, of which they fear to come to the end:\nhe felt so much pleasure in travelling that he dreaded the moment of\narrival at the place where they were to stop for the night.\n\nWe see that Montaigne travelled, just as he wrote, completely at his\nease, and without the least constraint, turning, just as he fancied, from\nthe common or ordinary roads taken by tourists.  The good inns, the soft\nbeds, the fine views, attracted his notice at every point, and in his\nobservations on men and things he confines himself chiefly to the\npractical side.  The consideration of his health was constantly before\nhim, and it was in consequence of this that, while at Venice, which\ndisappointed him, he took occasion to note, for the benefit of readers,\nthat he had an attack of colic, and that he evacuated two large stones\nafter supper.  On quitting Venice, he went in succession to Ferrara,\nRovigo, Padua, Bologna (where he had a stomach-ache), Florence, &c.; and\neverywhere, before alighting, he made it a rule to send some of his\nservants to ascertain where the best accommodation was to be had.  He\npronounced the Florentine women the finest in the world, but had not an\nequally good opinion of the food, which was less plentiful than in\nGermany, and not so well served.  He lets us understand that in Italy\nthey send up dishes without dressing, but in Germany they were much\nbetter seasoned, and served with a variety of sauces and gravies.  He\nremarked further, that the glasses were singularly small and the wines\ninsipid.\n\nAfter dining with the Grand-Duke of Florence, Montaigne passed rapidly\nover the intermediate country, which had no fascination for him, and\narrived at Rome on the last day of November, entering by the Porta del\nPopolo, and putting up at Bear.  But he afterwards hired, at twenty\ncrowns a month, fine furnished rooms in the house of a Spaniard, who\nincluded in these terms the use of the kitchen fire.  What most annoyed\nhim in the Eternal City was the number of Frenchmen he met, who all\nsaluted him in his native tongue; but otherwise he was very comfortable,\nand his stay extended to five months.  A mind like his, full of grand\nclassical reflections, could not fail to be profoundly impressed in the\npresence of the ruins at Rome, and he has enshrined in a magnificent\npassage of the Journal the feelings of the moment: \u201cHe said,\u201d writes his\nsecretary, \u201cthat at Rome one saw nothing but the sky under which she had\nbeen built, and the outline of her site: that the knowledge we had of her\nwas abstract, contemplative, not palpable to the actual senses: that\nthose who said they beheld at least the ruins of Rome, went too far, for\nthe ruins of so gigantic a structure must have commanded greater\nreverence-it was nothing but her sepulchre.  The world, jealous of her,\nprolonged empire, had in the first place broken to pieces that admirable\nbody, and then, when they perceived that the remains attracted worship\nand awe, had buried the very wreck itself.--[Compare a passage in one\nof Horace Walpole\u2019s letters to Richard West, 22 March 1740 (Cunningham\u2019s\nedit.  i.  41), where Walpole, speaking of Rome, describes her very ruins\nas ruined.]--As to those small fragments which were still to be seen on\nthe surface, notwithstanding the assaults of time and all other attacks,\nagain and again repeated, they had been favoured by fortune to be some\nslight evidence of that infinite grandeur which nothing could entirely\nextingish.  But it was likely that these disfigured remains were the\nleast entitled to attention, and that the enemies of that immortal\nrenown, in their fury, had addressed themselves in the first instance to\nthe destruction of what was most beautiful and worthiest of preservation;\nand that the buildings of this bastard Rome, raised upon the ancient\nproductions, although they might excite the admiration of the present\nage, reminded him of the crows\u2019 and sparrows\u2019 nests built in the walls\nand arches of the old churches, destroyed by the Huguenots.  Again, he\nwas apprehensive, seeing the space which this grave occupied, that the\nwhole might not have been recovered, and that the burial itself had been\nburied.  And, moreover, to see a wretched heap of rubbish, as pieces of\ntile and pottery, grow (as it had ages since) to a height equal to that\nof Mount Gurson,--[In Perigord.]--and thrice the width of it, appeared to\nshow a conspiracy of destiny against the glory and pre-eminence of that\ncity, affording at the same time a novel and extraordinary proof of its\ndeparted greatness.  He (Montaigne) observed that it was difficult to\nbelieve considering the limited area taken up by any of her seven hills\nand particularly the two most favoured ones, the Capitoline and the\nPalatine, that so many buildings stood on the site.  Judging only from\nwhat is left of the Temple of Concord, along the \u2018Forum Romanum\u2019, of\nwhich the fall seems quite recent, like that of some huge mountain split\ninto horrible crags, it does not look as if more than two such edifices\ncould have found room on the Capitoline, on which there were at one\nperiod from five-and-twenty to thirty temples, besides private dwellings.\nBut, in point of fact, there is scarcely any probability of the views\nwhich we take of the city being correct, its plan and form having changed\ninfinitely; for instance, the \u2018Velabrum\u2019, which on account of its\ndepressed level, received the sewage of the city, and had a lake, has\nbeen raised by artificial accumulation to a height with the other hills,\nand Mount Savello has, in truth, grown simply out of the ruins of the\ntheatre of Marcellus.  He believed that an ancient Roman would not\nrecognise the place again.  It often happened that in digging down into\nearth the workmen came upon the crown of some lofty column, which, though\nthus buried, was still standing upright.  The people there have no\nrecourse to other foundations than the vaults and arches of the old\nhouses, upon which, as on slabs of rock, they raise their modern palaces.\nIt is easy to see that several of the ancient streets are thirty feet\nbelow those at present in use.\u201d\n\nSceptical as Montaigne shows himself in his books, yet during his sojourn\nat Rome he manifested a great regard for religion.  He solicited the\nhonour of being admitted to kiss the feet of the Holy Father, Gregory\nXIII.; and the Pontiff exhorted him always to continue in the devotion\nwhich he had hitherto exhibited to the Church and the service of the Most\nChristian King.\n\n\u201cAfter this, one sees,\u201d says the editor of the Journal, \u201cMontaigne\nemploying all his time in making excursions bout the neighbourhood on\nhorseback or on foot, in visits, in observations of every kind.  The\nchurches, the stations, the processions even, the sermons; then the\npalaces, the vineyards, the gardens, the public amusements, as the\nCarnival, &c.--nothing was overlooked.  He saw a Jewish child\ncircumcised, and wrote down a most minute account of the operation.  He\nmet at San Sisto a Muscovite ambassador, the second who had come to Rome\nsince the pontificate of Paul III.  This minister had despatches from his\ncourt for Venice, addressed to the \u2018Grand Governor of the Signory\u2019.  The\ncourt of Muscovy had at that time such limited relations with the other\npowers of Europe, and it was so imperfect in its information, that it\nthought Venice to be a dependency of the Holy See.\u201d\n\nOf all the particulars with which he has furnished us during his stay at\nRome, the following passage in reference to the Essays is not the least\nsingular: \u201cThe Master of the Sacred Palace returned him his Essays,\ncastigated in accordance with the views of the learned monks.  \u2018He had\nonly been able to form a judgment of them,\u2019 said he, \u2018through a certain\nFrench monk, not understanding French himself\u2019\u201d--we leave Montaigne\nhimself to tell the story--\u201cand he received so complacently my excuses\nand explanations on each of the passages which had been animadverted upon\nby the French monk, that he concluded by leaving me at liberty to revise\nthe text agreeably to the dictates of my own conscience.  I begged him,\non the contrary, to abide by the opinion of the person who had criticised\nme, confessing, among other matters, as, for example, in my use of the\nword fortune, in quoting historical poets, in my apology for Julian, in\nmy animadversion on the theory that he who prayed ought to be exempt from\nvicious inclinations for the time being; item, in my estimate of cruelty,\nas something beyond simple death; item, in my view that a child ought to\nbe brought up to do everything, and so on; that these were my opinions,\nwhich I did not think wrong; as to other things, I said that the\ncorrector understood not my meaning.  The Master, who is a clever man,\nmade many excuses for me, and gave me to suppose that he did not concur\nin the suggested improvements; and pleaded very ingeniously for me in my\npresence against another (also an Italian) who opposed my sentiments.\u201d\n\nSuch is what passed between Montaigne and these two personages at that\ntime; but when the Essayist was leaving, and went to bid them farewell,\nthey used very different language to him.  \u201cThey prayed me,\u201d says he,\n\u201cto pay no attention to the censure passed on my book, in which other\nFrench persons had apprised them that there were many foolish things;\nadding, that they honoured my affectionate intention towards the Church,\nand my capacity; and had so high an opinion of my candour and\nconscientiousness that they should leave it to me to make such\nalterations as were proper in the book, when I reprinted it; among other\nthings, the word fortune.  To excuse themselves for what they had said\nagainst my book, they instanced works of our time by cardinals and other\ndivines of excellent repute which had been blamed for similar faults,\nwhich in no way affected reputation of the author, or of the publication\nas a whole; they requested me to lend the Church the support of my\neloquence (this was their fair speech), and to make longer stay in the\nplace, where I should be free from all further intrusion on their part.\nIt seemed to me that we parted very good friends.\u201d\n\nBefore quitting Rome, Montaigne received his diploma of citizenship, by\nwhich he was greatly flattered; and after a visit to Tivoli he set out\nfor Loretto, stopping at Ancona, Fano, and Urbino.  He arrived at the\nbeginning of May 1581, at Bagno della Villa, where he established\nhimself, order to try the waters.  There, we find in the Journal, of his\nown accord the Essayist lived in the strictest conformity with the\nregime, and henceforth we only hear of diet, the effect which the waters\nhad by degrees upon system, of the manner in which he took them; in a\nword, he does not omit an item of the circumstances connected with his\ndaily routine, his habit of body, his baths, and the rest.  It was no\nlonger the journal of a traveller which he kept, but the diary of an\ninvalid,--[\u201cI am reading Montaigne\u2019s Travels, which have lately been\nfound; there is little in them but the baths and medicines he took, and\nwhat he had everywhere for dinner.\u201d--H.  Walpole to Sir Horace Mann, June\n8, 1774.]--attentive to the minutest details of the cure which he was\nendeavouring to accomplish: a sort of memorandum book, in which he was\nnoting down everything that he felt and did, for the benefit of his\nmedical man at home, who would have the care of his health on his return,\nand the attendance on his subsequent infirmities.  Montaigne gives it as\nhis reason and justification for enlarging to this extent here, that he\nhad omitted, to his regret, to do so in his visits to other baths, which\nmight have saved him the trouble of writing at such great length now; but\nit is perhaps a better reason in our eyes, that what he wrote he wrote\nfor his own use.\n\nWe find in these accounts, however, many touches which are valuable as\nillustrating the manners of the place.  The greater part of the entries\nin the Journal, giving the account of these waters, and of the travels,\ndown to Montaigne\u2019s arrival at the first French town on his homeward\nroute, are in Italian, because he wished to exercise himself in that\nlanguage.\n\nThe minute and constant watchfulness of Montaigne over his health and\nover himself might lead one to suspect that excessive fear of death which\ndegenerates into cowardice.  But was it not rather the fear of the\noperation for the stone, at that time really formidable?  Or perhaps he\nwas of the same way of thinking with the Greek poet, of whom Cicero\nreports this saying: \u201cI do not desire to die; but the thought of being\ndead is indifferent to me.\u201d  Let us hear, however, what he says himself\non this point very frankly: \u201cIt would be too weak and unmanly on my part\nif, certain as I am of always finding myself in the position of having to\nsuccumb in that way,--[To the stone or gravel.]--and death coming nearer\nand nearer to me, I did not make some effort, before the time came, to\nbear the trial with fortitude.  For reason prescribes that we should\njoyfully accept what it may please God to send us.  Therefore the only\nremedy, the only rule, and the sole doctrine for avoiding the evils by\nwhich mankind is surrounded, whatever they are, is to resolve to bear\nthem so far as our nature permits, or to put an end to them courageously\nand promptly.\u201d\n\nHe was still at the waters of La Villa, when, on the 7th September 1581,\nhe learned by letter that he had been elected Mayor of Bordeaux on the\n1st August preceding.  This intelligence made him hasten his departure;\nand from Lucca he proceeded to Rome.  He again made some stay in that\ncity, and he there received the letter of the jurats of Bordeaux,\nnotifying to him officially his election to the Mayoralty, and inviting\nhim to return as speedily as possible.  He left for France, accompanied\nby young D\u2019Estissac and several other gentlemen, who escorted him a\nconsiderable distance; but none went back to France with him, not even\nhis travelling companion.  He passed by Padua, Milan, Mont Cenis, and\nChambery; thence he went on to Lyons, and lost no time in repairing to\nhis chateau, after an absence of seventeen months and eight days.\n\nWe have just seen that, during his absence in Italy, the author of the\nEssays was elected mayor of Bordeaux.  \u201cThe gentlemen of Bordeaux,\u201d says\nhe, \u201celected me Mayor of their town while I was at a distance from\nFrance, and far from the thought of such a thing.  I excused myself; but\nthey gave to understand that I was wrong in so doing, it being also the\ncommand of the king that I should stand.\u201d  This the letter which Henry\nIII. wrote to him on the occasion:\n\nMONSIEUR, DE MONTAIGNE,--Inasmuch as I hold in great esteem your fidelity\nand zealous devotion to my service, it has been a pleasure to me to learn\nthat you have been chosen mayor of my town of Bordeaux.  I have had the\nagreeable duty of confirming the selection, and I did so the more\nwillingly, seeing that it was made during your distant absence; wherefore\nit is my desire, and I require and command you expressly that you proceed\nwithout delay to enter on the duties to which you have received so\nlegitimate a call.  And so you will act in a manner very agreeable to me,\nwhile the contrary will displease me greatly.  Praying God, M. de\nMontaigne, to have you in his holy keeping.\n\n\u201cWritten at Paris, the 25th day of November 1581.\n\n\u201cHENRI.\n\n\u201cA Monsieur de MONTAIGNE,\nKnight of my Order, Gentleman in Ordinary of my\nChamber, being at present in Rome.\u201d\n\nMontaigne, in his new employment, the most important in the province,\nobeyed the axiom, that a man may not refuse a duty, though it absorb his\ntime and attention, and even involve the sacrifice of his blood.  Placed\nbetween two extreme parties, ever on the point of getting to blows, he\nshowed himself in practice what he is in his book, the friend of a middle\nand temperate policy.  Tolerant by character and on principle, he\nbelonged, like all the great minds of the sixteenth century, to that\npolitical sect which sought to improve, without destroying, institutions;\nand we may say of him, what he himself said of La Boetie, \u201cthat he had\nthat maxim indelibly impressed on his mind, to obey and submit himself\nreligiously to the laws under which he was born.  Affectionately attached\nto the repose of his country, an enemy to changes and innovations, he\nwould have preferred to employ what means he had towards their\ndiscouragement and suppression, than in promoting their success.\u201d  Such\nwas the platform of his administration.\n\nHe applied himself, in an especial manner, to the maintenance of peace\nbetween the two religious factions which at that time divided the town of\nBordeaux; and at the end of his two first years of office, his grateful\nfellow-citizens conferred on him (in 1583) the mayoralty for two years\nmore, a distinction which had been enjoyed, as he tells us, only twice\nbefore.  On the expiration of his official career, after four years\u2019\nduration, he could say fairly enough of himself that he left behind him\nneither hatred nor cause of offence.\n\nIn the midst of the cares of government, Montaigne found time to revise\nand enlarge his Essays, which, since their appearance in 1580, were\ncontinually receiving augmentation in the form of additional chapters or\npapers.  Two more editions were printed in 1582 and 1587; and during this\ntime the author, while making alterations in the original text, had\ncomposed part of the Third Book.  He went to Paris to make arrangements\nfor the publication of his enlarged labours, and a fourth impression in\n1588 was the result.  He remained in the capital some time on this\noccasion, and it was now that he met for the first time Mademoiselle de\nGournay.  Gifted with an active and inquiring spirit, and, above all,\npossessing a sound and healthy tone of mind, Mademoiselle de Gournay had\nbeen carried from her childhood with that tide which set in with\nsixteenth century towards controversy, learning, and knowledge.  She\nlearnt Latin without a master; and when, the age of eighteen, she\naccidentally became possessor of a copy of the Essays, she was\ntransported with delight and admiration.\n\nShe quitted the chateau of Gournay, to come and see him.  We cannot do\nbetter, in connection with this journey of sympathy, than to repeat the\nwords of Pasquier: \u201cThat young lady, allied to several great and noble\nfamilies of Paris, proposed to herself no other marriage than with her\nhonour, enriched with the knowledge gained from good books, and, beyond\nall others, from the essays of M. de Montaigne, who making in the year\n1588 a lengthened stay in the town of Paris, she went there for the\npurpose of forming his personal acquaintance; and her mother, Madame de\nGournay, and herself took him back with them to their chateau, where, at\ntwo or three different times, he spent three months altogether, most\nwelcome of visitors.\u201d  It was from this moment that Mademoiselle de\nGournay dated her adoption as Montaigne\u2019s daughter, a circumstance which\nhas tended to confer immortality upon her in a far greater measure than\nher own literary productions.\n\nMontaigne, on leaving Paris, stayed a short time at Blois, to attend the\nmeeting of the States-General.  We do not know what part he took in that\nassembly: but it is known that he was commissioned, about this period, to\nnegotiate between Henry of Navarre (afterwards Henry IV.) and the Duke of\nGuise.  His political life is almost a blank; but De Thou assures us that\nMontaigne enjoyed the confidence of the principal persons of his time.\nDe Thou, who calls him a frank man without constraint, tells us that,\nwalking with him and Pasquier in the court at the Castle of Blois, he\nheard him pronounce some very remarkable opinions on contemporary events,\nand he adds that Montaigne had foreseen that the troubles in France could\nnot end without witnessing the death of either the King of Navarre or of\nthe Duke of Guise.  He had made himself so completely master of the views\nof these two princes, that he told De Thou that the King of Navarre would\nhave been prepared to embrace Catholicism, if he had not been afraid of\nbeing abandoned by his party, and that the Duke of Guise, on his part,\nhad no particular repugnance to the Confession of Augsburg, for which the\nCardinal of Lorraine, his uncle, had inspired him with a liking, if it\nhad not been for the peril involved in quitting the Romish communion.  It\nwould have been easy for Montaigne to play, as we call it, a great part\nin politics, and create for himself a lofty position but his motto was,\n\u2018Otio et Libertati\u2019; and he returned quietly home to compose a chapter\nfor his next edition on inconveniences of Greatness.\n\nThe author of the Essays was now fifty-five.  The malady which tormented\nhim grew only worse and worse with years; and yet he occupied himself\ncontinually with reading, meditating, and composition.  He employed the\nyears 1589, 1590, and 1591 in making fresh additions to his book; and\neven in the approaches of old age he might fairly anticipate many happy\nhours, when he was attacked by quinsy, depriving him of the power\nutterance.  Pasquier, who has left us some details  his last hours,\nnarrates that he remained three days in full possession of his faculties,\nbut unable to speak, so that, in order to make known his desires, he was\nobliged to resort to writing; and as he felt his end drawing near, he\nbegged his wife to summon certain of the gentlemen who lived in the\nneighbourhood to bid them a last farewell.  When they had arrived, he\ncaused mass to be celebrated in apartment; and just as the priest was\nelevating the host, Montaigne fell forward with his arms extended in\nfront of him, on the bed, and so expired.  He was in his sixtieth year.\nIt was the 13th September 1592.\n\nMontaigne was buried near his own house; but a few years after his\ndecease, his remains were removed to the church of a Commandery of St.\nAntoine at Bordeaux, where they still continue.  His monument was\nrestored in 1803 by a descendant.  It was seen about 1858 by an English\ntraveller (Mr. St.  John).\u2019--[\u201cMontaigne the Essayist,\u201d by Bayle St.\nJohn, 1858, 2 vols.  8vo, is one of most delightful books of the kind.]--\nand was then in good preservation.\n\nIn 1595 Mademoiselle de Gournay published a new edition of Montaigne\u2019s\nEssays, and the first with the latest emendations of the author, from a\ncopy presented to her by his widow, and which has not been recovered,\nalthough it is known to have been in existence some years after the date\nof the impression, made on its authority.\n\nColdly as Montaigne\u2019s literary productions appear to have been received\nby the generation immediately succeeding his own age, his genius grew\ninto just appreciation in the seventeenth century, when such great\nspirits arose as La Bruyere, Moliere, La Fontaine, Madame de Sevigne.\n\u201cO,\u201d exclaimed the Chatelaine des Rochers, \u201cwhat capital company he is,\nthe dear man!  he is my old friend; and just for the reason that he is\nso, he always seems new.  My God!  how full is that book of sense!\u201d\n Balzac said that he had carried human reason as far and as high as it\ncould go, both in politics and in morals.  On the other hand, Malebranche\nand the writers of Port Royal were against him; some reprehended the\nlicentiousness of his writings; others their impiety, materialism,\nepicureanism.  Even Pascal, who had carefully read the Essays, and gained\nno small profit by them, did not spare his reproaches.  But Montaigne has\noutlived detraction.  As time has gone on, his admirers and borrowers\nhave increased in number, and his Jansenism, which recommended him to the\neighteenth century, may not be his least recommendation in the\nnineteenth.  Here we have certainly, on the whole, a first-class man, and\none proof of his masterly genius seems to be, that his merits and his\nbeauties are sufficient to induce us to leave out of consideration\nblemishes and faults which would have been fatal to an inferior writer.\n\n\n\n\n\n                       THE LETTERS OF MONTAIGNE.\n\n\nI.\n\nTo Monsieur de MONTAIGNE\n\n[This account of the death of La Boetie begins imperfectly.  It first\nappeared in a little volume of Miscellanies in 1571.  See Hazlitt, ubi\nsup.  p.  630.]--As to his last words, doubtless, if any man can\ngive good account of them, it is I, both because, during the whole of his\nsickness he conversed as fully with me as with any one, and also because,\nin consequence of the singular and brotherly friendship which we had\nentertained for each other, I was perfectly acquainted with the\nintentions, opinions, and wishes which he had formed in the course of his\nlife, as much so, certainly, as one man can possibly be with those of\nanother man; and because I knew them to be elevated, virtuous, full of\nsteady resolution, and (after all said) admirable.  I well foresaw that,\nif his illness permitted him to express himself, he would allow nothing\nto fall from him, in such an extremity, that was not replete with good\nexample.  I consequently took every care in my power to treasure what was\nsaid.  True it is, Monseigneur, as my memory is not only in itself very\nshort, but in this case affected by the trouble which I have undergone,\nthrough so heavy and important a loss, that I have forgotten a number of\nthings which I should wish to have had known; but those which I recollect\nshall be related to you as exactly as lies in my power.  For to represent\nin full measure his noble career suddenly arrested, to paint to you his\nindomitable courage, in a body worn out and prostrated by pain and the\nassaults of death, I confess, would demand a far better ability than\nmine: because, although, when in former years he discoursed on serious\nand important matters, he handled them in such a manner that it was\ndifficult to reproduce exactly what he said, yet his ideas and his words\nat the last seemed to rival each other in serving him.  For I am sure\nthat I never knew him give birth to such fine conceptions, or display so\nmuch eloquence, as in the time of his sickness.  If, Monseigneur, you\nblame me for introducing his more ordinary observations, please to know\nthat I do so advisedly; for since they proceeded from him at a season of\nsuch great trouble, they indicate the perfect tranquillity of his mind\nand thoughts to the last.\n\nOn Monday, the 9th day of August 1563, on my return from the Court, I\nsent an invitation to him to come and dine with me.  He returned word\nthat he was obliged, but, being indisposed, he would thank me to do him\nthe pleasure of spending an hour with him before he started for Medoc.\nShortly after my dinner I went to him.  He had laid himself down on the\nbed with his clothes on, and he was already, I perceived, much changed.\nHe complained of diarrhoea, accompanied by the gripes, and said that he\nhad it about him ever since he played with M. d\u2019Escars with nothing but\nhis doublet on, and that with him a cold often brought on such attacks.\nI advised him to go as he had proposed, but to stay for the night at\nGermignac, which is only about two leagues from the town.  I gave him\nthis advice, because some houses, near to that where he was ping, were\nvisited by the plague, about which he was nervous since his return from\nPerigord and the Agenois, here it had been raging; and, besides, horse\nexercise was, from my own experience, beneficial under similar\ncircumstances.  He set out, accordingly, with his wife and M.\nBouillhonnas, his uncle.\n\nEarly on the following morning, however, I had intelligence from Madame\nde la Boetie, that in the night he had fresh and violent attack of\ndysentery.  She had called in physician and apothecary, and prayed me to\nlose no time coming, which (after dinner) I did.  He was delighted to see\nme; and when I was going away, under promise to turn the following day,\nhe begged me more importunately and affectionately than he was wont to\ndo, to give him as such of my company as possible.  I was a little\naffected; yet was about to leave, when Madame de la Boetie, as if she\nforesaw something about to happen, implored me with tears to stay the\nnight.  When I consented, he seemed to grow more cheerful.  I returned\nhome the next day, and on the Thursday I paid him another visit.  He had\nbecome worse; and his loss of blood from the dysentery, which reduced his\nstrength very much, was largely on the increase.  I quitted his side on\nFriday, but on Saturday I went to him, and found him very weak.  He then\ngave me to understand that his complaint was infectious, and, moreover,\ndisagreeable and depressing; and that he, knowing thoroughly my\nconstitution, desired that I should content myself with coming to see him\nnow and then.  On the contrary, after that I never left his side.\n\nIt was only on the Sunday that he began to converse with me on any\nsubject beyond the immediate one of his illness, and what the ancient\ndoctors thought of it: we had not touched on public affairs, for I found\nat the very outset that he had a dislike to them.\n\nBut, on the Sunday, he had a fainting fit; and when he came to himself,\nhe told me that everything seemed to him confused, as if in a mist and in\ndisorder, and that, nevertheless, this visitation was not unpleasing to\nhim.  \u201cDeath,\u201d I replied, \u201chas no worse sensation, my brother.\u201d  \u201cNone so\nbad,\u201d was his answer.  He had had no regular sleep since the beginning of\nhis illness; and as he became worse and worse, he began to turn his\nattention to questions which men commonly occupy themselves with in the\nlast extremity, despairing now of getting better, and intimating as much\nto me.  On that day, as he appeared in tolerably good spirits, I took\noccasion to say to him that, in consideration of the singular love I bore\nhim, it would become me to take care that his affairs, which he had\nconducted with such rare prudence in his life, should not be neglected at\npresent; and that I should regret it if, from want of proper counsel, he\nshould leave anything unsettled, not only on account of the loss to his\nfamily, but also to his good name.\n\nHe thanked me for my kindness; and after a little reflection, as if he\nwas resolving certain doubts in his own mind, he desired me to summon his\nuncle and his wife by themselves, in order that he might acquaint them\nwith his testamentary dispositions.  I told him that this would shock\nthem.  \u201cNo, no,\u201d he answered, \u201cI will cheer them by making out my case to\nbe better than it is.\u201d  And then he inquired, whether we were not all\nmuch taken by surprise at his having fainted?  I replied, that it was of\nno importance, being incidental to the complaint from which he suffered.\n\u201cTrue, my brother,\u201d said he; \u201cit would be unimportant, even though it\nshould lead to what you most dread.\u201d  \u201cFor you,\u201d I rejoined, \u201cit might be\na happy thing; but I should be the loser, who would thereby be deprived\nof so great, so wise, and so steadfast a friend, a friend whose place I\nshould never see supplied.\u201d  \u201cIt is very likely you may not,\u201d was his\nanswer; \u201cand be sure that one thing which makes me somewhat anxious to\nrecover, and to delay my journey to that place, whither I am already\nhalf-way gone, is the thought of the loss both you and that poor man and\nwoman there (referring to his uncle and wife) must sustain; for I love\nthem with my whole heart, and I feel certain that they will find it very\nhard to lose me.  I should also regret it on account of such as have, in\nmy lifetime, valued me, and whose conversation I should like to have\nenjoyed a little longer; and I beseech you, my brother, if I leave the\nworld, to carry to them for me an assurance of the esteem I entertained\nfor them to the last moment of my existence.  My birth was, moreover,\nscarcely to so little purpose but that, had I lived, I might have done\nsome service to the public; but, however this may be, I am prepared to\nsubmit to the will of God, when it shall please Him to call me, being\nconfident of enjoying the tranquillity which you have foretold for me.\nAs for you, my friend, I feel sure that you are so wise, that you will\ncontrol your emotions, and submit to His divine ordinance regarding me;\nand I beg of you to see that that good man and woman do not mourn for my\ndeparture unnecessarily.\u201d\n\nHe proceeded to inquire how they behaved at present.  \u201cVery well,\u201d said\nI, \u201cconsidering the circumstances.\u201d  \u201cAh!\u201d  he replied, \u201cthat is, so long\nas they do not abandon all hope of me; but when that shall be the case,\nyou will have a hard task to support them.\u201d  It was owing to his strong\nregard for his wife and uncle that he studiously disguised from them his\nown conviction as to the certainty of his end, and he prayed me to do the\nsame.  When they were near him he assumed an appearance of gaiety, and\nflattered them with hopes.  I then went to call them.  They came, wearing\nas composed an air as possible; and when we four were together, he\naddressed us, with an untroubled countenance, as follows: \u201cUncle and\nwife, rest assured that no new attack of my disease, or fresh doubt that\nI have as to my recovery, has led me to take this step of communicating\nto you my intentions, for, thank God, I feel very well and hopeful; but\ntaught by observation and experience the instability of all human things,\nand even of the life to which we are so much attached, and which is,\nnevertheless, a mere bubble; and knowing, moreover, that my state of\nhealth brings me more within the danger of death, I have thought proper\nto settle my worldly affairs, having the benefit of your advice.\u201d  Then\naddressing himself more particularly to his uncle, \u201cGood uncle,\u201d said he,\n\u201cif I were to rehearse all the obligations under which I lie to you, I am\nsure that I never should make an end.  Let me only say that, wherever I\nhave been, and with whomsoever I have conversed, I have represented you\nas doing for me all that a father could do for a son; both in the care\nwith which you tended my education, and in the zeal with which you pushed\nme forward into public life, so that my whole existence is a testimony of\nyour good offices towards me.  In short, I am indebted for all that I\nhave to you, who have been to me as a parent; and therefore I have no\nright to part with anything, unless it be with your approval.\u201d\n\nThere was a general silence hereupon, and his uncle was prevented from\nreplying by tears and sobs.  At last he said that whatever he thought for\nthe best would be agreeable to him; and as he intended to make him his\nheir, he was at liberty to dispose of what would be his.\n\nThen he turned to his wife.  \u201cMy image,\u201d said he (for so he often called\nher, there being some sort of relationship between them), \u201csince I have\nbeen united to you by marriage, which is one of the most weighty and\nsacred ties imposed on us by God, for the purpose of maintaining human\nsociety, I have continued to love, cherish, and value you; and I know\nthat you have returned my affection, for which I have no sufficient\nacknowledgment.  I beg you to accept such portion of my estate as I\nbequeath to you, and be satisfied with it, though it is very inadequate\nto your desert.\u201d\n\nAfterwards he turned to me.  \u201cMy brother,\u201d he began, \u201cfor whom I have so\nentire a love, and whom I selected out of so large a number, thinking to\nrevive with you that virtuous and sincere friendship which, owing to the\ndegeneracy of the age, has grown to be almost unknown to us, and now\nexists only in certain vestiges of antiquity, I beg of you, as a mark of\nmy affection to you, to accept my library: a slender offering, but given\nwith a cordial will, and suitable to you, seeing that you are fond of\nlearning.  It will be a memorial of your old companion.\u201d\n\nThen he addressed all three of us.  He blessed God that in his extremity\nhe had the happiness to be surrounded by those whom he held dearest in\nthe world, and he looked upon it as a fine spectacle, where four persons\nwere together, so unanimous in their feelings, and loving each other for\neach other\u2019s sake.  He commended us one to the other; and proceeded thus:\n\u201cMy worldly matters being arranged, I must now think of the welfare of my\nsoul.  I am a Christian; I am a Catholic.  I have lived one, and I shall\ndie one.  Send for a priest; for I wish to conform to this last Christian\nobligation.\u201d  He now concluded his discourse, which he had conducted with\nsuch a firm face and with so distinct an utterance, that whereas, when I\nfirst entered his room, he was feeble, inarticulate in his speech, his\npulse low and feverish, and his features pallid, now, by a sort of\nmiracle, he appeared to have rallied, and his pulse was so strong that\nfor the sake of comparison, I asked him to feel mine.\n\nI felt my heart so oppressed at this moment, that I had not the power to\nmake him any answer; but in the course of two or three hours, solicitous\nto keep up his courage, and, likewise, out of the tenderness which I had\nhad all my life for his honour and fame, wishing a larger number of\nwitnesses to his admirable fortitude, I said to him, how much I was\nashamed to think that I lacked courage to listen to what he, so great a\nsufferer, had the courage to deliver; that down to the present time I had\nscarcely conceived that God granted us such command over human\ninfirmities, and had found a difficulty in crediting the examples I had\nread in histories; but that with such evidence of the thing before my\neyes, I gave praise to God that it had shown itself in one so excessively\ndear to me, and who loved me so entirely, and that his example would help\nme to act in a similar manner when my turn came.  Interrupting me, he\nbegged that it might happen so, and that the conversation which had\npassed between us might not be mere words, but might be impressed deeply\non our minds, to be put in exercise at the first occasion; and that this\nwas the real object and aim of all philosophy.\n\nHe then took my hand, and continued: \u201cBrother, friend, there are many\nacts of my life, I think, which have cost me as much difficulty as this\none is likely to do; and, after all, I have been long prepared for it,\nand have my lesson by heart.  Have I not lived long enough?  I am just\nupon thirty-three.  By the grace of God, my days so far have known\nnothing but health and happiness; but in the ordinary course of our\nunstable human affairs, this could not have lasted much longer; it would\nhave become time for me to enter on graver avocations, and I should thus\nhave involved myself in numberless vexations, and, among them, the\ntroubles of old age, from which I shall now be exempt.  Moreover, it is\nprobable that hitherto my life has been spent more simply, and with less\nof evil, than if God had spared me, and I had survived to feel the\nthirst for riches and worldly prosperity.  I am sure, for my part, that\nI now go to God and the place of the blessed.\u201d  He seemed to detect in\nmy expression some inquietude at his words; and he exclaimed, \u201cWhat, my\nbrother, would you make me entertain apprehensions?  Had I any, whom\nwould it become so much as yourself to remove them?\u201d\n\nThe notary, who had been summoned to draw up his will, came in the\nevening, and when he had the documents prepared, I inquired of La Boetie\nif he would sign them.  \u201cSign them,\u201d cried he; \u201cI will do so with my own\nhand; but I could desire more time, for I feel exceedingly timid and\nweak, and in a manner exhausted.\u201d  But when I was going to change the\nconversation, he suddenly rallied, said he had but a short time to live,\nand asked if the notary wrote rapidly, for he should dictate without\nmaking any pause.  The notary was called, and he dictated his will there\nand then with such speed that the man could scarcely keep up with him;\nand when he had done, he asked me to read it out, saying to me, \u201cWhat a\ngood thing it is to look after what are called our riches.\u201d  \u2018Sunt haec,\nquoe hominibus vocantur bona\u2019.  As soon as the will was signed, the\nchamber being full, he asked me if it would hurt him to talk.  I\nanswered, that it would not, if he did not speak too loud.  He then\nsummoned Mademoiselle de Saint Quentin, his niece, to him, and addressed\nher thus: \u201cDear niece, since my earliest acquaintance with thee, I have\nobserved the marks of, great natural goodness in thee; but the services\nwhich thou rendered to me, with so much affectionate diligence, in my\npresent and last necessity, inspire me with high hopes of thee; and I am\nunder great obligations to thee, and give thee most affectionate thanks.\nLet me relieve my conscience by counselling thee to be, in the first\nplace, devout, to God: for this doubtless is our first duty, failing\nwhich all others can be of little advantage or grace, but which, duly\nobserved, carries with it necessarily all other virtues.  After God, thou\nshouldest love thy father and mother--thy mother, my sister, whom I\nregard as one of the best and most intelligent of women, and by whom I\nbeg of thee to let thy own life be regulated.  Allow not thyself to be\nled away by pleasures; shun, like the plague, the foolish familiarities\nthou seest between some men and women; harmless enough at first, but\nwhich by insidious degrees corrupt the heart, and thence lead it to\nnegligence, and then into the vile slough of vice.  Credit me, the\ngreatest safeguard to female chastity is sobriety of demeanour.  I\nbeseech and direct that thou often call to mind the friendship which was\nbetwixt us; but I do not wish thee to mourn for me too much--an\ninjunction which, so far as it is in my power, I lay on all my friends,\nsince it might seem that by doing so they felt a jealousy of that blessed\ncondition in which I am about to be placed by death.  I assure thee, my\ndear, that if I had the option now of continuing in life or of completing\nthe voyage on which I have set out, I should find it very hard to choose.\nAdieu, dear niece.\u201d\n\nMademoiselle d\u2019Arsat, his stepdaughter, was next called.  He said to her:\n\u201cDaughter, you stand in no great need of advice from me, insomuch as you\nhave a mother, whom I have ever found most sagacious, and entirely in\nconformity with my own opinions and wishes, and whom I have never found\nfaulty; with such a preceptress, you cannot fail to be properly\ninstructed.  Do not account it singular that I, with no tie of blood to\nyou, am interested in you; for, being the child of one who is so closely\nallied to me, I am necessarily concerned in what concerns you; and\nconsequently the affairs of your brother, M. d\u2019Arsat, have ever been\nwatched by me with as much care as my own; nor perhaps will it be to your\ndisadvantage that you were my step-daughter.  You enjoy sufficient store\nof wealth and beauty; you are a lady of good family; it only remains for\nyou to add to these possessions the cultivation of your mind, in which I\nexhort you not to fail.  I do not think necessary to warn you against\nvice, a thing so odious in women, for I would not even suppose that you\ncould harbour any inclination for it--nay, I believe that you hold the\nvery name in abhorrence.  Dear daughter, farewell.\u201d\n\nAll in the room were weeping and lamenting; but he held without\ninterruption the thread of his discourse, which was pretty long.  But\nwhen he had done, he directed us all to leave the room, except the women\nattendants, whom he styled his garrison.  But first, calling to him my\nbrother, M. de Beauregard, he said to him: \u201cM. de Beauregard, you have\nmy best thanks for all the care you have taken of me.  I have now a thing\nwhich I am very anxious indeed to mention to you, and with your\npermission I will do so.\u201d  As my brother gave him encouragement to\nproceed, he added: \u201cI assure you that I never knew any man who engaged in\nthe reformation of our Church with greater sincerity, earnestness, and\nsingle-heartedness than yourself.  I consider that you were led to it by\nobserving the vicious character of our prelates, which no doubt much\nrequires setting in order, and by imperfections which time has brought\ninto our Church.  It is not my desire at present  discourage you from\nthis course, for I would have no one act in opposition to his conscience;\nbut I wish, having regard to the good repute acquired by your family from\nits enduring concord--a family than which none can be dearer to me; a\nfamily, thank God!  no member of which has ever been guilty of dishonour\n--in regard, further, to the will of your good father to whom you owe so\nmuch, and of your, uncle, I wish you to avoid extreme means; avoid\nharshness and violence: be reconciled with your relatives; do not act\napart, but unite.  You perceive what disasters our quarrels have brought\nupon this kingdom, and I anticipate still worse mischiefs; and in your\ngoodness and wisdom, beware of involving your family in such broils; let\nit continue to enjoy its former reputation and happiness.  M. de\nBeauregard, take what I say in good part, and as a proof of the\nfriendship I feel for you.  I postponed till now any communication with\nyou on the subject, and perhaps the condition in which you see me address\nyou, may cause my advice and opinion to carry greater authority.\u201d  My\nbrother expressed his thanks to him cordially.\n\nOn the Monday morning he had become so ill that he quite despaired of\nhimself; and he said to me very pitifully: \u201cBrother, do not you feel pain\nfor all the pain I am suffering?  Do you not perceive now that the help\nyou give me has no other effect than that of lengthening my suffering?\u201d\n\nShortly afterwards he fainted, and we all thought him gone; but by the\napplication of vinegar and wine he rallied.  But he soon sank, and when\nhe heard us in lamentation, he murmured, \u201cO God!  who is it that teases\nme so?  Why did you break the agreeable repose I was enjoying?  I beg of\nyou to leave me.\u201d  And then, when he caught the sound of my voice, he\ncontinued: \u201cAnd art thou, my brother, likewise unwilling to see me at\npeace?  O, how thou robbest me of my repose!\u201d  After a while, he seemed\nto gain more strength, and called for wine, which he relished, and\ndeclared it to be the finest drink possible.  I, in order to change the\ncurrent of his thoughts, put in, \u201cSurely not; water is the best.\u201d  \u201cAh,\nyes,\u201d he returned, \u201cdoubtless so;--(Greek phrase)--.\u201d  He had now become,\nicy-cold at his extremities, even to his face; a deathly perspiration was\nupon him, and his pulse was scarcely perceptible.\n\nThis morning he confessed, but the priest had omitted to bring with him\nthe necessary apparatus for celebrating Mass.  On the Tuesday, however,\nM. de la Boetie summoned him to aid him, as he said, in discharging the\nlast office of a Christian.   After the conclusion of Mass, he took the\nsacrament; when the priest was about to depart, he said to him:\n\u201cSpiritual father, I implore you humbly, as well as those over whom you\nare set, to pray to the Almighty on my behalf; that, if it be decreed in\nheaven that I am now to end my life, He will take compassion on my soul,\nand pardon me my sins, which are manifold, it not being possible for so\nweak and poor a creature as I to obey completely the will of such a\nMaster; or, if He think fit to keep me longer here, that it may please\nHim to release my present extreme anguish, and to direct my footsteps in\nthe right path, that I may become a better man than I have been.\u201d  He\npaused to recover breath a little; priest was about to go away, he called\nhim back and proceeded: \u201cI desire to say, besides, in your hearing this:\nI declare that I was christened and I have lived, and that so I wish to\ndie, in the faith which Moses preached in Egypt; which afterwards the\nPatriarchs accepted and professed in Judaea; and which, in the course of\ntime, has been transmitted to France and to us.\u201d  He seemed desirous of\nadding something more, but he ended with a request to his uncle and me to\nsend up prayers for him; \u201cfor those are,\u201d he said, \u201cthe best duties that\nChristians can fulfil one for another.\u201d  In the course of talking, his\nshoulder was uncovered, and although a man-servant stood near him, he\nasked his uncle to re-adjust the clothes.  Then, turning his eyes towards\nme, he said, \u201cIngenui est, cui multum debeas, ei plurimum velle debere.\u201d\n\nM. de Belot called in the afternoon to see him, and M. de la Boetie,\ntaking his hand, said to him: \u201cI was on the point of discharging my debt,\nbut my kind creditor has given me a little further time.\u201d  A little while\nafter, appearing to wake out of a sort of reverie, he uttered words which\nhe had employed once or twice before in the course of his sickness:\n\u201cAh well, ah well, whenever the hour comes, I await it with pleasure and\nfortitude.\u201d  And then, as they were holding his mouth open by force to\ngive him a draught, he observed to M. de Belot: \u201cAn vivere tanti est?\u201d\n\nAs the evening approached, he began perceptibly to sink; and while I\nsupped, he sent for me to come, being no more than the shadow of a man,\nor, as he put it himself, \u2018non homo, sed species hominis\u2019; and he said to\nme with the utmost difficulty: \u201cMy brother, my friend, please God I may\nrealise the imaginations I have just enjoyed.\u201d  Afterwards, having waited\nfor some time while he remained silent, and by painful efforts was\ndrawing long sighs (for his tongue at this point began to refuse its\nfunctions), I said, \u201cWhat are they?\u201d  \u201cGrand, grand!\u201d  he replied.  \u201cI\nhave never yet failed,\u201d returned I, \u201cto have the honour of hearing your\nconceptions and imaginations communicated to me; will you not now still\nlet me enjoy them?\u201d  \u201cI would indeed,\u201d he answered; \u201cbut, my brother,\nI am not able to do so; they are admirable, infinite, and unspeakable.\u201d\n We stopped short there, for he could not go on.  A little before, indeed,\nhe had shown a desire to speak to his wife, and had told her, with as gay\na countenance as he could contrive to assume, that he had a story to tell\nher.  And it seemed as if he was making an attempt to gain utterance;\nbut, his strength failing him, he begged a little wine to resuscitate it.\nIt was of no avail, for he fainted away suddenly, and was for some time\ninsensible.  Having become so near a neighbour to death, and hearing the\nsobs of Mademoiselle de la Boetie, he called her, and said to her thus:\n\u201cMy own likeness, you grieve yourself beforehand; will you not have pity\non me?  take courage.  Assuredly, it costs me more than half the pain I\nendure, to see you suffer; and reasonably so, because the evils which we\nourselves feel we do not actually ourselves suffer, but it certain\nsentient faculties which God plants in us, that feel them: whereas what\nwe feel on account of others, we feel by consequence of a certain\nreasoning process which goes on within our minds.  But I am going away\u201d\n --That he said because his strength was failing him; and fearing that he\nhad frightened his wife, he resumed, observing: \u201cI am going to sleep.\nGood night, my wife; go thy way.\u201d  This was the last farewell he took of\nher.\n\nAfter she had left, \u201cMy brother,\u201d said he to me, \u201ckeep near me, if you\nplease;\u201d and then feeling the advance of death more pressing and more\nacute, or else the effect of some warm draught which they had made him\nswallow, his voice grew stronger and clearer, and he turned quite with\nviolence in his bed, so that all began again to entertain the hope which\nwe had lost only upon witnessing his extreme prostration.\n\nAt this stage he proceeded, among other things, to pray me again and\nagain, in a most affectionate manner, to give him a place; so that I was\napprehensive that his reason might be impaired, particularly when, on my\npointing out to him that he was doing himself harm, and that these were\nnot of the words of a rational man, he did not yield at first, but\nredoubled his outcry, saying, \u201cMy brother, my brother!  dost thou then\nrefuse me a place?\u201d  insomuch that he constrained me to demonstrate to\nhim that, as he breathed and spoke, and had his physical being, therefore\nhe had his place.  \u201cYes, yes,\u201d he responded, \u201cI have; but it is not that\nwhich I need; and, besides, when all is said, I have no longer any\nexistence.\u201d  \u201cGod,\u201d I replied, \u201cwill grant you a better one soon.\u201d\n \u201cWould it were now, my brother,\u201d was his answer.  \u201cIt is now three days\nsince I have been eager to take my departure.\u201d\n\nBeing in this extremity, he frequently called me, merely to satisfy him\nthat I was at his side.  At length, he composed himself a little to rest,\nwhich strengthened our hopes; so much so, indeed, that I left the room,\nand went to rejoice thereupon with Mademoiselle de la Boetie.  But, an\nhour or so afterwards, he called me by name once or twice, and then with\na long sigh expired at three o\u2019clock on Wednesday morning, the 18th\nAugust 1563, having lived thirty-two years, nine months, and seventeen\ndays.\n\n\n\n\nII.\n\nTo Monseigneur, Monseigneur de MONTAIGNE.\n\n[This letter is prefixed to Montaigne\u2019s translation of the \u201cNatural\nTheology\u201d of Raymond de Sebonde, printed at Paris in 1569.]\n\nIn pursuance of the instructions which you gave me last year in your\nhouse at Montaigne, Monseigneur, I have put into a French dress, with my\nown hand, Raymond de Sebonde, that great Spanish theologian and\nphilosopher; and I have divested him, so far as I could, of that rough\nbearing and barbaric appearance which you saw him wear at first; that, in\nmy opinion, he is now qualified to present himself in the best company.\nIt is perfectly possible that some fastidious persons will detect in the\nbook some trace of Gascon parentage; but it will be so much the more to\ntheir discredit, that they allowed the task to devolve on one who is\nquite a novice in these things.  It is only right, Monseigneur, that the\nwork should come before the world under your auspices, since whatever\nemendations and polish it may have received, are owing to you.  Still I\nsee well that, if you think proper to balance accounts with the author,\nyou will find yourself much his debtor; for against his excellent and\nreligious discourses, his lofty and, so to speak, divine conceptions, you\nwill find that you will have to set nothing but words and phraseology; a\nsort of merchandise so ordinary and commonplace, that whoever has the\nmost of it, peradventure is the worst off.\n\nMonseigneur, I pray God to grant you a very long and happy life.  From\nParis, this 18th of June 1568.  Your most humble and most obedient son,\n\nMICHEL DE MONTAIGNE\n\n\n\n\nIII.\n\nTo Monsieur, Monsieur de LANSAC,--[This letter appears to belong to\n1570.]--Knight of the King\u2019s Order, Privy Councillor, Sub-controller of\nhis Finance, and Captain of the Cent Gardes of his Household.\n\nMONSIEUR,--I send you the OEconomics of Xenophon, put into French by the\nlate M. de la Boetie,--[Printed at Paris, 8vo, 1571, and reissued, with\nthe addition of some notes, in 1572, with a fresh title-page.]--a present\nwhich appears to me to be appropriate, as well because it is the work of\na gentleman of mark,--[Meaning Xenophon.]--a man illustrious in war and\npeace, as because it has taken its second shape from a personage whom I\nknow to have been held by you in affectionate regard during his life.\nThis will be an inducement to you to continue to cherish towards his\nmemory, your good opinion and goodwill.  And to be bold with you,\nMonsieur, do not fear to increase these sentiments somewhat; for, as you\nhad knowledge of his high qualities only in his public capacity, it rests\nwith me to assure you how many endowments he possessed beyond your\npersonal experience of him.  He did me the honour, while he lived, and I\ncount it amongst the most fortunate circumstances in my own career, to\nhave with me a friendship so close and so intricately knit, that no\nmovement, impulse, thought, of his mind was kept from me, and if I have\nnot formed a right judgment of him, I must suppose it to be from my own\nwant of scope.  Indeed, without exaggeration, he was so nearly a prodigy,\nthat I am afraid of not being credited when I speak of him, even though I\nshould keep much within the mark of my own actual knowledge.  And for\nthis time, Monsieur, I shall content myself with praying you, for the\nhonour and respect we owe to truth, to testify and believe that our\nGuienne never beheld his peer among the men of his vocation.  Under the\nhope, therefore, that you will pay him his just due, and in order to\nrefresh him in your memory, I present you this book, which will answer\nfor me that, were it not for the insufficiency of my power, I would offer\nyou as willingly something of my own, as an acknowledgment of the\nobligations I owe to you, and of the ancient favour and friendship which\nyou have borne towards the members of our house.  But, Monsieur, in\ndefault of better coin, I offer you in payment the assurance of my desire\nto do you humble service.\n\nMonsieur, I pray God to have you in His keeping.  Your obedient servant,\nMICHEL DE MONTAIGNE.\n\n\n\n\nIV.\n\nTo Monsieur, Monsieur de MESMES, Lord of Roissy and Malassize, Privy\nCouncillor to the King.\n\nMONSIEUR,--It is one of the most conspicuous follies committed by men,\nto employ the strength of their understanding in overturning and\ndestroying those opinions which are commonly received among us, and which\nafford us satisfaction and content; for while everything beneath heaven\nemploys the ways and means placed at its disposal by nature for the\nadvancement and commodity of its being, these, in order to appear of a\nmore sprightly and enlightened wit, not accepting anything which has not\nbeen tried and balanced a thousand times with the most subtle reasoning,\nsacrifice their peace of mind to doubt, uneasiness, and feverish\nexcitement.  It is not without reason that childhood and simplicity have\nbeen recommended by holy writ itself.  For my part, I prefer to be quiet\nrather than clever: give me content, even if I am not to be so wide in my\nrange.  This is the reason, Monsieur, why, although persons of an\ningenious turn laugh at our care as to what will happen after our own\ntime, for instance, to our souls, which, lodged elsewhere, will lose all\nconsciousness of what goes on here below, yet I consider it to be a great\nconsolation for the frailty and brevity of life, to reflect that we have\nthe power of prolonging it by reputation and fame; and I embrace very\nreadily this pleasant and favourable notion original with our being,\nwithout inquiring too critically how or why it is.  Insomuch that having\nloved, beyond everything, the late M. de la Boetie, the greatest man, in\nmy judgment, of our age, I should think myself very negligent of my duty\nif I failed, to the utmost of my power, to prevent such a name as his,\nand a memory so richly meriting remembrance, from falling into oblivion;\nand if I did not use my best endeavour to keep them fresh.  I believe\nthat he feels something of what I do on his behalf, and that my services\ntouch and rejoice him.  In fact, he lives in my heart so vividly and so\nwholly, that I am loath to believe him committed to the dull ground, or\naltogether cast off from communication with us.  Therefore, Monsieur,\nsince every new light I can shed on him and his name, is so much added to\nhis second period of existence, and, moreover, since his name is ennobled\nand honoured by the place which receives it, it falls to me not only to\nextend it as widely as I can, but to confide it to the keeping of persons\nof honour and virtue; among whom you hold such a rank, that, to afford\nyou the opportunity of receiving this new guest, and giving him good\nentertainment, I decided on presenting to you this little work, not for\nany profit you are likely to derive from it, being well aware that you do\nnot need to have Plutarch and his companions interpreted to you--but it\nis possible that Madame de Roissy, reading in it the order of her\nhousehold management and of your happy accord painted to the life, will\nbe pleased to see how her own natural inclination has not only reached\nbut surpassed the theories of the wisest philosophers, regarding the\nduties and laws of the wedded state.  And, at all events, it will be\nalways an honour to me, to be able to do anything which shall be for the\npleasure of you and yours, on account of the obligation under which I lie\nto serve you.\n\nMonsieur, I pray God to grant you a long and happy life.  From Montaigne,\nthis 30th April 1570.  Your humble servant,\nMICHEL DE MONTAIGNE.\n\n\n\n\nV.\n\nTo Monsieur, Monsieur de L\u2019HOSPITAL, Chancellor of France\n\nMONSEIGNEUR,--I am of the opinion that persons such as you, to whom\nfortune and reason have committed the charge of public affairs, are not\nmore inquisitive in any point than in ascertaining the character of those\nin office under you; for no society is so poorly furnished, but that, if\na proper distribution of authority be used, it has persons sufficient for\nthe discharge of all official duties; and when this is the case, nothing\nis wanting to make a State perfect in its constitution.  Now, in\nproportion as this is so much to be desired, so it is the more difficult\nof accomplishment, since you cannot have eyes to embrace a multitude so\nlarge and so widely extended, nor to see to the bottom of hearts, in\norder that you may discover intentions and consciences, matters\nprincipally to be considered; so that there has never been any\ncommonwealth so well organised, in which we might not detect often enough\ndefect in such a department or such a choice; and in those systems, where\nignorance and malice, favouritism, intrigue, and violence govern, if any\nselection happens to be made on the ground of merit and regularity, we\nmay doubtless thank Fortune, which, in its capricious movements, has for\nonce taken the path of reason.\n\nThis consideration, Monseigneur, often consoled me, when I beheld M.\nEtienne de la Boetie, one of the fittest men for high office in France,\npass his whole life without employment and notice, by his domestic\nhearth, to the singular detriment of the public; for, so far as he was\nconcerned, I may assure you, Monseigneur, that he was so rich in those\ntreasures which defy fortune, that never was man more satisfied or\ncontent.  I know, indeed, that he was raised to the dignities connected\nwith his neighbourhood--dignities accounted considerable; and I know\nalso, that no one ever acquitted himself better of them; and when he died\nat the age of thirty-two, he enjoyed a reputation in that way beyond all\nwho had preceded him.\n\nBut for all that, it is no reason that a man should be left a common\nsoldier, who deserves to become a captain; nor to assign mean functions\nto those who are perfectly equal to the highest.  In truth, his powers\nwere badly economised and too sparingly employed; insomuch that, over and\nabove his actual work, there was abundant capacity lying idle which might\nhave been called into service, both to the public advantage and his own\nprivate glory.\n\nTherefore, Monseigneur, since he was so indifferent to his own fame (for\nvirtue and ambition, unfortunately, seldom lodge together), and since he\nlived in an age when others were too dull or too jealous to witness to\nhis character, I have it marvellously at heart that his memory, at all\nevents, to which I owe the good offices of a friend, should enjoy the\nrecompense of his brave life; and that it should survive in the good\nreport of men of honour and virtue.  On this account, sir, I have been\ndesirous to bring to light, and present to you, such few Latin verses as\nhe left behind.  Different from the builder, who places the most\nattractive, portion of his house towards the street, and to the draper,\nwho displays in his window his best goods, that which was most precious\nin my friend, the juice and marrow of his genius, departed with him, and\nthere have remained to us but the bark and the leaves.\n\nThe exactly regulated movements of his mind, his piety, his virtue, his\njustice, his vivacity, the solidity and soundness of his judgment, the\nloftiness of his ideas, raised so far above the common level, his\nlearning, the grace which accompanied his most ordinary actions, the\ntender affection he had for his miserable country, and his supreme and\nsworn detestation of all vice, but principally of that villainous traffic\nwhich disguises itself under the honourable name of justice, should\ncertainly impress all well-disposed persons with a singular love towards\nhim, and an extraordinary regret for his loss.  But, sir, I am unable to\ndo justice to all these qualities; and of the fruit of his own studies it\nhad not entered into his mind to leave any proof to posterity; all that\nremains, is the little which, as a pastime, he did at intervals.\n\nHowever this may be, I beg you, sir, to receive it kindly; and as our\njudgment of great things is many times formed from lesser things, and as\neven the recreations of illustrious men carry with them, to intelligent\nobservers, some honourable traits of their origin, I would have you form\nfrom this, some knowledge of him, and hence lovingly cherish his name and\nhis memory.  In this, sir, you will only reciprocate the high opinion\nwhich he had of your virtue, and realise what he infinitely desired in\nhis lifetime; for there was no one in the world in whose acquaintance and\nfriendship he would have been so happy to see himself established, as in\nyour own.  But if any man is offended by the freedom which I use with the\nbelongings of another, I can tell him that nothing which has been written\nor been laid down, even in the schools of philosophy, respecting the\nsacred duties and rights of friendship, could give an adequate idea of\nthe relations which subsisted between this personage and myself.\n\nMoreover, sir, this slender gift, to make two throws of one stone at the\nsame time, may likewise serve, if you please, to testify the honour and\nrespect which I entertain for your ability and high qualities; for as to\nthose gifts which are adventitious and accidental, it is not to my taste\nto take them into account.\n\nSir, I pray God to grant you a very happy and a very long life.  From\nMontaigne, this 30th of April 1570.--Your humble and obedient servant,\n\nMICHEL DE MONTAIGNE.\n\n\n\n\nTo Monsieur, Monsieur de Folx, Privy Councillor, and Ambassador of His\nMajesty to the Signory of Venice.--[ Printed before the \u2018Vers Francois\u2019\nof Etienne de la Boetie, 8vo, Paris, 1572.]\n\nSIR,--Being on the point of commending to you and to posterity the memory\nof the late Etienne de la Boetie, as well for his extreme virtue as for\nthe singular affection which he bore to me, it struck me as an\nindiscretion very serious in its results, and meriting some coercion from\nour laws, the practice which often prevails of robbing virtue of glory,\nits faithful associate, in order to confer it, in accordance with our\nprivate interests and without discrimination, on the first comer; seeing\nthat our two principal guiding reins are reward and punishment, which\nonly touch us properly, and as men, through the medium of honour and\ndishonour, forasmuch as these penetrate the mind, and come home to our\nmost intimate feelings: just where animals themselves are susceptible,\nmore or less, to all other kinds of recompense and corporal chastisement.\nMoreover, it is well to notice that the custom of praising virtue, even\nin those who are no longer with us, impalpable as it is to them, serves\nas a stimulant to the living to imitate their example; just as capital\nsentences are carried out by the law, more for the sake of warning to\nothers, than in relation to those who suffer.  Now, commendation and its\nopposite being analogous as regards effects, we cannot easily deny\nthe fact, that although the law prohibits one man from slandering the\nreputation of another, it does not prevent us from bestowing reputation\nwithout cause.  This pernicious licence in respect to the distribution of\npraise, has formerly been confined in its area of operations; and it may\nbe the reason why poetry once lost favour with the more judicious.\nHowever this may be, it cannot be concealed that the vice of falsehood is\none very unbecoming in gentleman, let it assume what guise it will.\n\nAs for that personage of whom I am speaking to you, sir he leads me far\naway indeed from this kind of language; for the danger in his case is\nnot, lest I should lend him anything, but that I might take something\nfrom him; and it is his ill-fortune that, while he has supplied me, so\nfar as ever a man could, with just and obvious opportunities for\ncommendation, I find myself unable and unqualified to render it to him\n--I, who am his debtor for so many vivid communications, and who alone\nhave it in my power to answer for a million of accomplishments,\nperfections, and virtues, latent (thanks to his unkind stars) in so noble\na soul.  For the nature of things having (I know not how) permitted that\ntruth, fair and acceptable--as it may be of itself, is only embraced\nwhere there are arts of persuasion, to insinuate it into our minds, I see\nmyself so wanting, both in authority to support my simple testimony, and\nin the eloquence requisite for lending it value and weight, that I was on\nthe eve of relinquishing the task, having nothing of his which would\nenable me to exhibit to the world a proof of his genius and knowledge.\n\nIn truth, sir, having been overtaken by his fate in the flower of his\nage, and in the full enjoyment of the most vigorous health, it had been\nhis design to publish some day works which would have demonstrated to\nposterity what sort of a man he was; and, peradventure, he was\nindifferent enough to fame, having formed such a plan in his head, to\nproceed no further in it.  But I have come to the conclusion, that it was\nfar more excusable in him to bury with him all his rare endowments, than\nit would be on my part to bury also with me the knowledge of them which I\nhad acquired from him; and, therefore, having collected with care all the\nremains which I found scattered here and there among his papers, I intend\nto distribute them so as to recommend his memory to as many persons as\npossible, selecting the most suitable and worthy of my acquaintance, and\nthose whose testimony might do him greatest honour: such as you, sir, who\nmay very possibly have had some knowledge of him during his life, but\nassuredly too slight to discover the perfect extent of his worth.\nPosterity may credit me, if it chooses, when I swear upon my conscience,\nthat I knew and saw him to be such as, all things considered, I could\nneither desire nor imagine a genius surpassing his.\n\nI beg you very humbly, sir, not only to take his name under your general\nprotection, but also these ten or twelve French stanzas, which lay\nthemselves, as of necessity, under shadow of your patronage.  For I will\nnot disguise from you, that their publication was deferred, upon the\nappearance of his other writings, under the pretext (as it was alleged\nyonder at Paris) that they were too crude to come to light.  You will\njudge, sir, how much truth there is in this; and since it is thought that\nhereabout nothing can be produced in our own dialect but what is\nbarbarous and unpolished, it falls to you, who, besides your rank as the\nfirst house in Guienne, indeed down from your ancestors, possess every\nother sort of qualification, to establish, not merely by your example,\nbut by your authoritative testimony, that such is not always the case:\nthe more so that, though \u2018tis more natural with the Gascons to act than\ntalk, yet sometimes they employ the tongue more than the arm, and wit in\nplace of valour.\n\nFor my own part; sir, it is not in my way to judge of such matters; but I\nhave heard persons who are supposed to understand them, say that these\nstanzas are not only worthy to be presented in the market-place, but,\nindependently of that, as regards beauty and wealth of invention, they\nare full of marrow and matter as any compositions of the kind, which have\nappeared in our language.  Naturally each workman feels himself more\nstrong in some special part his art, and those are to be regarded as most\nfortunate, who lay hands on the noblest, for all the parts essential to\nthe construction of any whole are not equally precious.  We find\nelsewhere, perhaps, greater delicacy phrase, greater softness and harmony\nof language; but imaginative grace, and in the store of pointed wit, I do\nnot think he has been surpassed; and we should take the account that he\nmade these things neither his occupation nor his study, and that he\nscarcely took a pen in his hand more than once a year, as is shown by the\nvery slender quantity of his remains.  For you see here, sir, green wood\nand dry, without any sort of selection, all that has come into my\npossession; insomuch that there are among the rest efforts even of his\nboyhood.  In point of fact, he seems to have written them merely to show\nthat he was capable of dealing with all subjects: for otherwise,\nthousands of times, in the course of ordinary conversation, I have heard\nthings drop from him infinitely more worthy of being admired, infinitely\nmore worthy of being preserved.\n\nSuch, sir, is what justice and affection, forming in this instance a rare\nconjunction, oblige me to say of this great and good man; and if I have\nat all offended by the freedom which I have taken in addressing myself to\nyou on such a subject at such a length, be pleased to recollect that the\nprincipal result of greatness and eminence is to lay one open to\nimportunate appeals on behalf of the rest of the world.  Herewith, after\ndesiring you to accept my affectionate devotion to your service,\nI beseech God to vouchsafe you, sir, a fortunate and prolonged life.\nFrom Montaigne, this 1st of September 1570.--Your obedient servant,\n\nMICHEL DE MONTAIGNE.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo Mademoiselle de MONTAIGNE, my Wife.--[Printed as a preface to the\n\u201cConsolation of Plutarch to his Wife,\u201d published by Montaigne, with\nseveral other tracts by La Boetie, about 1571.]\n\nMY WIFE,--You understand well that it is not proper for a man of the\nworld, according to the rules of this our time, to continue to court and\ncaress you; for they say that a sensible person may take a wife indeed,\nbut that to espouse her is to act like a fool.  Let them talk; I adhere\nfor my part the custom of the good old days; I also wear my hair as it\nused to be then; and, in truth, novelty costs this poor country up to the\npresent moment so dear (and I do not know whether we have reached the\nhighest pitch yet), that everywhere and in everything I renounce the\nfashion.  Let us live, my wife, you and I, in the old French method.\nNow, you may recollect that the late M. de la Boetie, my brother and\ninseparable companion, gave me, on his death-bed, all his books and\npapers, which have remained ever since the most precious part of my\neffects.  I do not wish to keep them niggardly to myself alone, nor do I\ndeserve to have the exclusive use of them; so that I have resolved to\ncommunicate them to my friends; and because I have none, I believe, more\nparticularly intimate you, I send you the Consolatory Letter written by\nPlutarch to his Wife, translated by him into French; regretting much that\nfortune has made it so suitable a present you, and that, having had but\none child, and that a daughter, long looked for, after four years of your\nmarried life it was your lot to lose her in the second year of her age.\nBut I leave to Plutarch the duty of comforting you, acquainting you with\nyour duty herein, begging you to put your faith in him for my sake; for\nhe will reveal to you my own ideas, and will express the matter far\nbetter than I should myself.  Hereupon, my wife, I commend myself very\nheartily to your good will, and pray God to have you in His keeping.\nFrom Paris, this 10th September 1570.--Your good husband,\n\nMICHEL DE MONTAIGNE.\n\n\n\n\nVIII.\n\nTo Monsieur DUPUY,--[This is probably the Claude Dupuy, born at Paris in\n1545, and one of the fourteen judges sent into Guienne after the treaty\nof Fleix in 1580.  It was perhaps under these circumstances that\nMontaigne addressed to him the present letter.]--the King\u2019s Councillor in\nhis Court and Parliament of Paris.\n\nMONSIEUR,--The business of the Sieur de Verres, a prisoner, who is\nextremely well known to me, deserves, in the arrival at a decision,\nthe exercise of the clemency natural to you, if, in the public interest,\nyou can fairly call it into play.  He has done a thing not only\nexcusable, according to the military laws of this age, but necessary and\n(as we are of opinion) commendable.  He committed the act, without doubt,\nunwillingly and under pressure; there is no other passage of his life\nwhich is open to reproach.  I beseech you, sir, to lend the matter your\nattentive consideration; you will find the character of it as I represent\nit to you.  He is persecuted on this crime, in a way which is far worse\nthan the offence itself.  If it is likely to be of use to him, I desire\nto inform you that he is a man brought up in my house, related to several\nrespectable families, and a person who, having led an honourable life,\nis my particular friend.  By saving him you lay me under an extreme\nobligation.  I beg you very humbly to regard him as recommended by me,\nand, after kissing your hands, I pray God, sir, to grant you a long and\nhappy life.  From Castera, this 23d of April [1580].  Your affectionate\nservant,\nMONTAIGNE.\n\n\n\n\n\nIX.\n\nTo the Jurats of Bordeaux.--[Published from the original among the\narchives of the town of Bordeaux, M. Gustave Brunet in the Bulletin du\nBibliophile, July 1839.]\n\nGENTLEMEN,--I trust that the journey of Monsieur de Cursol will be of\nadvantage to the town.  Having in hand a case so just and so favourable,\nyou did all in your power to put the business in good trim; and matters\nbeing so well situated, I beg you to excuse my absence for some little\ntime longer, and I will abridge my stay so far as the pressure of my\naffairs permits.  I hope that the delay will be short; however, you will\nkeep me, if you please, in your good grace, and will command me, if the\noccasion shall arise, in employing me in the public service and in yours.\nMonsieur de Cursol has also written to me and apprised me of his journey.\nI humbly commend myself to you, and pray God, gentlemen, to grant you\nlong and happy life.  From Montaigne, this 21st of May 1582.  Your humble\nbrother and servant,\nMONTAIGNE.\n\n\n\n\nX.\n\nTo the same.--[The original is among the archives of Toulouse.]\n\nGENTLEMEN,--I have taken my fair share of the satisfaction which you\nannounce to me as feeling at the good despatch of your business, as\nreported to you by your deputies, and I regard it as a favourable sign\nthat you have made such an auspicious commencement of the year.  I hope\nto join you at the earliest convenient opportunity.  I recommend myself\nvery humbly to your gracious consideration, and pray God to grant you,\ngentlemen, a happy and long life.  From Montaigne, this 8th February\n1585.  Your humble brother and servant,\nMONTAIGNE.\n\n\n\n\nXI.\n\nTo the same.\n\nGENTLEMEN,--I have here received news of you from M. le Marechal.  I will\nnot spare either my life or anything else for your service, and will\nleave it to your judgment whether the assistance I might be able to\nrender by my presence at the forthcoming election, would be worth the\nrisk I should run by going into the town, seeing the bad state it is in,\n--[This refers to the plague then raging, and which carried off 14,000\npersons at Bordeaux.]--particularly for people coming away from so fine\nan air as this is where I am.  I will draw as near to you on Wednesday as\nI can, that is, to Feuillas, if the malady has not reached that place,\nwhere, as I write to M. de la Molte, I shall be very pleased to have the\nhonour of seeing one of you to take your directions, and relieve myself\nof the credentials which M. le Marechal will give me for you all:\ncommending myself hereupon humbly to your good grace, and praying God to\ngrant you, gentlemen, long and happy life.  At Libourne, this 30th of\nJuly 1585.  Your humble servant and brother,\nMONTAIGNE.\n\n\n\n\nXII.--[\u201cAccording to Dr. Payen, this letter belongs to 1588.  Its\nauthenticity has been called in question; but wrongly, in our opinion.\nSee \u2018Documents inedits\u2019, 1847, p.  12.\u201d--Note in \u2018Essais\u2019, ed.  Paris,\n1854, iv.  381.  It does not appear to whom the letter was addressed.]\n\nMONSEIGNEUR,--You have heard of our baggage being taken from us under our\neyes in the forest of Villebois: then, after a good deal of discussion\nand delay, of the capture being pronounced illegal by the Prince.  We\ndared not, however, proceed on our way, from an uncertainty as to the\nsafety of our persons, which should have been clearly expressed on our\npassports.  The League has done this, M. de Barrant and M. de la\nRochefocault; the storm has burst on me, who had my money in my box.  I\nhave recovered none of it, and most of my papers and cash--[The French\nword is hardes, which St. John renders things.  But compare Chambers\u2019s\n\u201cDomestic Annals of Scotland,\u201d 2d ed.  i.  48.]--remain in their\npossession.  I have not seen the Prince.  Fifty were lost .  .  .  as for\nthe Count of Thorigny, he lost some ver plate and a few articles of\nclothing.  He diverged from his route to pay a visit to the mourning\nladies at Montresor, where are the remains of his two brothers and his\ngrandmother, and came to us again in this town, whence we shall resume\nour journey shortly.  The journey to Normandy is postponed.  The King has\ndespatched MM. De Bellieure and de la Guiche to M. de Guise to summon him\nto court; we shall be there on Thursday.\n\nFrom Orleans, this 16th of February, in the morning [1588-9?].--Your very\nhumble servant,\nMONTAIGNE.\n\n\n\n\n\nXIII.\n\nTo Mademoiselle PAULMIER.--[This letter, at the time of the publication\nof the variorum edition of 1854, appears to have been in private hands.\nSee vol.  iv.  p.  382.]\n\nMADEMOISELLE,--My friends know that, from the first moment of our\nacquaintance, I have destined a copy of my book for you; for I feel that\nyou have done it much honour.  The courtesy of M. Paulmier would deprive\nme of the pleasure of giving it to you now, for he has obliged me since a\ngreat deal beyond the worth of my book.  You will accept it then, if you\nplease, as having been yours before I owed it to you, and will confer on\nme the favour of loving it, whether for its own sake or for mine; and I\nwill keep my debt to M. Paulmier undischarged, that I may requite him, if\nI have at some other time the means of serving him.\n\n\n\n\nXIV.\n\nTo the KING, HENRY IV.--[The original is in the French national library,\nin the Dupuy collection.  It was first discovered by M. Achille Jubinal,\nwho printed it with a facsimile of the entire autograph, in 1850.  St.\nJohn gives the date wrongly as the 1st January 1590.]\n\nSIRE, It is to be above the weight and crowd of your great and important\naffairs, to know, as you do, how to lend yourself, and attend to small\nmatters in their turn, according to the duty of your royal dignity, which\nexposes you at all times to every description and degree of person and\nemployment.  Yet, that your Majesty should have deigned to consider my\nletter, and direct a reply to be made to it, I prefer to owe, less to\nyour strong understanding, than to your kindness of heart.  I have always\nlooked forward to your enjoyment of your present fortune, and you may\nrecollect that, even when I had to make confession of itto my cure, I\nviewed your successes with satisfaction: now, with the greater propriety\nand freedom, I embrace them affectionately.  They serve you where you are\nas positive matters of fact; but they serve us here no less by the fame\nwhich they diffuse: the echo carries as much weight as the blow.  We\nshould not be able to derive from the justice of your cause such powerful\narguments for the maintenance and reduction of your subjects, as we do\nfrom the reports of the success of your undertaking; and then I have to\nassure your Majesty, that the recent changes to your advantage, which you\nobserve hereabouts, the prosperous issue of your proceedings at Dieppe,\nhave opportunely seconded the honest zeal and marvellous prudence of M.\nthe Marshal de Matignon, from whom I flatter myself that you do not\nreceive day by day accounts of such good and signal services without\nremembering my assurances and expectations.  I look to the next summer,\nnot only for fruits which we may eat, but for those to grow out of our\ncommon tranquillity, and that it will pass over our heads with the same\neven tenor of happiness, dissipating, like its predecessors, all the fine\npromises with which your adversaries sustain the spirits of their\nfollowers.  The popular inclinations resemble a tidal wave; if the\ncurrent once commences in your favour, it will go on of its own force to\nthe end.  I could have desired much that the private gain of the soldiers\nof your army, and the necessity for satisfying them, had not deprived\nyou, especially in this principal town, of the glorious credit of treating\nyour mutinous subjects, in the midst of victory, with greater clemency\nthan their own protectors, and that, as distinguished from a passing and\nusurped repute, you could have shown them to be really your own, by the\nexercise of a protection truly paternal and royal.  In the conduct of\nsuch affairs as you have in hand, men are obliged to have recourse to\nunusual expedients.  It is always seen that they are surmounted by their\nmagnitude and difficulty; it not being found easy to complete the\nconquest by arms and force, the end has been accomplished by clemency and\ngenerosity, excellent lures to draw men particularly towards the just and\nlegitimate side.  If there is to be severity and punishment, let it be\ndeferred till success has been assured.  A great conqueror of past times\nboasts that he gave his enemies as great an inducement to love him, as\nhis friends.  And here we feel already some effect of the favourable\nimpression produced upon our rebellious towns by the contrast between\ntheir rude treatment, and that of those which are loyal to you.  Desiring\nyour Majesty a happiness more tangible and less hazardous, and that you\nmay be beloved rather than feared by your people, and believing that your\nwelfare and theirs are of necessity knit together, I rejoice to think that\nthe progress which you make is one towards more practicable conditions of\npeace, as well as towards victory!\n\nSire, your letter of the last of November came to my hand only just now,\nwhen the time which it pleased you to name for meeting you at Tours had\nalready passed.  I take it as a singular favour that you should have\ndeigned to desire a visit from so useless a person, but one who is wholly\nyours, and more so even by affection than from duty.  You have acted very\ncommendably in adapting yourself, in the matter of external forms, to\nyour new fortunes; but the preservation of your old affability and\nfrankness in private intercourse is entitled to an equal share of praise.\nYou have condescended to take thought for my age, no less than for the\ndesire which I have to see you, where you may be at rest from these\nlaborious agitations.  Will not that be soon at Paris, Sire?  and may\nnothing prevent me from presenting myself there!--Your very humble and\nvery obedient servant and subject,\nMONTAIGNE.\n\nFrom Montaigne, this 18th of January [1590].\n\n\n\n\nXV.\nTo the same.--[ This letter is also in the national collection, among the\nDupuy papers.  It was first printed in the \u201cJournal de l\u2019Instruction\nPublique,\u201d 4th November 1846.]\n\nSIRE,--The letter which it pleased your majesty to write to me on the\n20th of July, was not delivered to me till this morning, and found me\nlaid up with a very violent tertian ague, a complaint very common in this\npart of the country during the last month.  Sire, I consider myself\ngreatly honoured by the receipt of your commands, and I have not omitted\nto communicate to M. the Marshal de Matignon three times most\nemphatically my intention and obligation to proceed to him, and even so\nfar as to indicate the route by which I proposed to join him secretly, if\nhe thought proper.  Having received no answer, I consider that he has\nweighed the difficulty and risk of the journey to me.  Sire, your Majesty\ndill do me the favour to believe, if you please, that I shall never\ncomplain of the expense on occasions where I should not hesitate to\ndevote my life.  I have never derived any substantial benefit whatever\nfrom the bounty of kings, which I have neither sought nor merited; nor\nhave I had any recompense for the services which I have performed for\nthem: whereof your majesty is in part aware.  What I have done for your\npredecessors I shall do still more readily for you.  I am as rich, Sire,\nas I desire to be.  When I shall have exhausted my purse in attendance on\nyour Majesty at Paris, I will take the liberty to tell you, and then, if\nyou should regard me as worthy of being retained any longer in your\nsuite, you will find me more modest in my claims upon you than the\nhumblest of your officers.\n\nSire, I pray God for your prosperity and health.  Your very humble and\nvery obedient servant and subject,\nMONTAIGNE.\n\nFrom Montaigne, this 2d of September [1590].\n\n\n\n\nXVI.\n\nTo the Governor of Guienne.\n\nMONSEIGNEUR,--I have received this morning your letter, which I have\ncommunicated to M. de Gourgues, and we have dined together at the house\nof M.[the mayor] of Bourdeaux.  As to the inconvenience of transporting\nthe money named in your memorandum, you see how difficult a thing it is\nto provide for; but you may be sure that we shall keep as close a watch\nover it as possible.  I used every exertion to discover the man of whom\nyou spoke.  He has not been here; and M. de Bordeaux has shown me a\nletter in which he mentions that he could not come to see the Director of\nBordeaux, as he intended, having been informed that you mistrust him.\nThe letter is of the day before yesterday.  If I could have found him, I\nmight perhaps have pursued the gentler course, being uncertain of your\nviews; but I entreat you nevertheless to feel no manner of doubt that I\nrefuse to carry out any wishes of yours, and that, where your commands\nare concerned, I know no distinction of person or matter.  I hope that\nyou have in Guienne many as well affected to you as I am.  They report\nthat the Nantes galleys are advancing towards Brouage.  M. the Marshal de\nBiron has not yet left.  Those who were charged to convey the message to\nM. d\u2019Usee say that they cannot find him; and I believe that, if he has\nbeen here, he is so no longer.  We keep a vigilant eye on our gates and\nguards, and we look after them a little more attentively in your absence,\nwhich makes me apprehensive, not merely on account of the preservation of\nthe town, but likewise for your oven sake, knowing that the enemies of\nthe king feel how necessary you are to his service, and how ill we should\nprosper without you.  I am afraid that, in the part where you are, you\nwill be overtaken by so many affairs requiring your attention on every\nside, that it will take you a long time and involve great difficulty\nbefore you have disposed of everything.  If there is any important news,\nI will despatch an express at once, and you may conclude that nothing is\nstirring if you do not hear from me: at the same time begging you to bear\nin mind that movements of this kind are wont to be so sudden and\nunexpected that, if they occur, they will grasp me by the throat, before\nthey say a word.  I will do what I can to collect news, and for this\npurpose I will make a point of visiting and seeing men of every shade of\nopinion.  Down to the present time nothing is stirring.  M. de Londel has\nseen me this morning, and we have been arranging for some advances for\nthe place, where I shall go to-morrow morning.  Since I began this\nletter, I have learnt from Chartreux that two gentlemen, describing\nthemselves as in the service of M. de Guise, and coming from Agen, have\npassed near Chartreux; but I was not able to ascertain which road they\nhave taken.  They are expecting you at Agen.  The Sieur de Mauvesin came\nas far as Canteloup, and thence returned, having got some intelligence.\nI am in search of one Captain Rous, to whom .  .  .  wrote, trying to\ndraw him into his cause by all sorts of promises.  The rumour of the two\nNantes galleys ready to descend on Brouage is confirmed as certain; they\ncarry two companies of foot.  M. de Mercure is at Nantes.  The Sieur de\nla Courbe said to M. the President Nesmond that M. d\u2019Elbeuf is on this\nside of Angiers, and lodges with his father.  He is drawing towards Lower\nPoictou with 4000 foot and 400 or 500 horse, having been reinforced by\nthe troops of M. de Brissac and others, and M. de Mercure is to join him.\nThe report goes also that M. du Maine is about to take the command of all\nthe forces they have collected in Auvergne, and that he will cross Le\nForet to advance on Rouergue and us, that is to say, on the King of\nNavarre, against whom all this is being directed.  M. de Lansac is at\nBourg, and has two war vessels, which remain in attendance on him.  His\nfunctions are naval.  I tell you what I learn, and mix up together the\nmore or less probable hearsay of the town with actual matter of fact,\nthat you may be in possession of everything.  I beg you most humbly to\nreturn directly affairs may allow you to do so, and assure you that,\nmeanwhile, we shall not spare our labour, or (if that were necessary) our\nlife, to maintain the king\u2019s authority throughout.  Monseigneur, I kiss\nyour hands very respectfully, and pray God to have you in His keeping.\nFrom Bordeaux, Wednesday night, 22d May (1590-91).--Your very humble\nservant,\n\nMONTAIGNE.\n\nI have seen no one from the king of Navarre; they say that M. de Biron\nhas seen him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            THE AUTHOR TO THE READER.--[Omitted by Cotton.]\n\nREADER, thou hast here an honest book; it doth at the outset forewarn\nthee that, in contriving the same, I have proposed to myself no other\nthan a domestic and private end: I have had no consideration at all\neither to thy service or to my glory.  My powers are not capable of any\nsuch design.  I have dedicated it to the particular commodity of my\nkinsfolk and friends, so that, having lost me (which they must do\nshortly), they may therein recover some traits of my conditions and\nhumours, and by that means preserve more whole, and more life-like, the\nknowledge they had of me.

D.W.] (the same who\nso long governed our Guienne, a personage whose condition and fortune\nhave in them a great deal of the most notable and most considerable parts\nof grandeur), having been highly incensed by the Limousins, and taking\ntheir city by assault, was not, either by the cries of the people, or the\nprayers and tears of the women and children, abandoned to slaughter and\nprostrate at his feet for mercy, to be stayed from prosecuting his\nrevenge; till, penetrating further into the town, he at last took notice\nof three French gentlemen,--[These were Jean de Villemure, Hugh de la\nRoche, and Roger de Beaufort.--Froissart, i. c. 289. {The city was\nLimoges.  D.W.}]--who with incredible bravery alone sustained the power\nof his victorious army.  Then it was that consideration and respect unto\nso remarkable a valour first stopped the torrent of his fury, and that\nhis clemency, beginning with these three cavaliers, was afterwards\nextended to all the remaining inhabitants of the city.\n\nScanderbeg, Prince of Epirus, pursuing one of his soldiers with purpose\nto kill him, the soldier, having in vain tried by all the ways of\nhumility and supplication to appease him, resolved, as his last refuge,\nto face about and await him sword in hand: which behaviour of his gave a\nsudden stop to his captain\u2019s fury, who, for seeing him assume so notable\na resolution, received him into grace; an example, however, that might\nsuffer another interpretation with such as have not read of the\nprodigious force and valour of that prince.\n\nThe Emperor Conrad III. having besieged Guelph, Duke of Bavaria,--[In\n1140, in Weinsberg, Upper Bavaria.]--would not be prevailed upon, what\nmean and unmanly satisfactions soever were tendered to him, to condescend\nto milder conditions than that the ladies and gentlewomen only who were\nin the town with the duke might go out without violation of their honour,\non foot, and with so much only as they could carry about them.  Whereupon\nthey, out of magnanimity of heart, presently contrived to carry out, upon\ntheir shoulders, their husbands and children, and the duke himself;\na sight at which the emperor was so pleased, that, ravished with the\ngenerosity of the action, he wept for joy, and immediately extinguishing\nin his heart the mortal and capital hatred he had conceived against this\nduke, he from that time forward treated him and his with all humanity.\nThe one and the other of these two ways would with great facility work\nupon my nature; for I have a marvellous propensity to mercy and mildness,\nand to such a degree that I fancy of the two I should sooner surrender my\nanger to compassion than to esteem.  And yet pity is reputed a vice\namongst the Stoics, who will that we succour the afflicted, but not that\nwe should be so affected with their sufferings as to suffer with them.\nI conceived these examples not ill suited to the question in hand, and\nthe rather because therein we observe these great souls assaulted and\ntried by these two several ways, to resist the one without relenting, and\nto be shook and subjected by the other.  It may be true that to suffer a\nman\u2019s heart to be totally subdued by compassion may be imputed to\nfacility, effeminacy, and over-tenderness; whence it comes to pass that\nthe weaker natures, as of women, children, and the common sort of people,\nare the most subject to it but after having resisted and disdained the\npower of groans and tears, to yield to the sole reverence of the sacred\nimage of Valour, this can be no other than the effect of a strong and\ninflexible soul enamoured of and honouring masculine and obstinate\ncourage.  Nevertheless, astonishment and admiration may, in less generous\nminds, beget a like effect: witness the people of Thebes, who, having put\ntwo of their generals upon trial for their lives for having continued in\narms beyond the precise term of their commission, very hardly pardoned\nPelopidas, who, bowing under the weight of so dangerous an accusation,\nmade no manner of defence for himself, nor produced other arguments than\nprayers and supplications; whereas, on the contrary, Epaminondas, falling\nto recount magniloquently the exploits he had performed in their service,\nand, after a haughty and arrogant manner reproaching them with\ningratitude and injustice, they had not the heart to proceed any further\nin his trial, but broke up the court and departed, the whole assembly\nhighly commending the high courage of this personage.--[Plutarch, How\nfar a Man may praise Himself, c. 5.]\n\nDionysius the elder, after having, by a tedious siege and through\nexceeding great difficulties, taken the city of Reggio, and in it the\ngovernor Phyton, a very gallant man, who had made so obstinate a defence,\nwas resolved to make him a tragical example of his revenge: in order\nwhereunto he first told him, \u201cThat he had the day before caused his son\nand all his kindred to be drowned.\u201d  To which Phyton returned no other\nanswer but this: \u201cThat they were then by one day happier than he.\u201d  After\nwhich, causing him to be stripped, and delivering him into the hands of\nthe tormentors, he was by them not only dragged through the streets of\nthe town, and most ignominiously and cruelly whipped, but moreover\nvilified with most bitter and contumelious language: yet still he\nmaintained his courage entire all the way, with a strong voice and\nundaunted countenance proclaiming the honourable and glorious cause of\nhis death; namely, for that he would not deliver up his country into the\nhands of a tyrant; at the same time denouncing against him a speedy\nchastisement from the offended gods.  At which Dionysius, reading in his\nsoldiers\u2019 looks, that instead of being incensed at the haughty language\nof this conquered enemy, to the contempt of their captain and his\ntriumph, they were not only struck with admiration of so rare a virtue,\nbut moreover inclined to mutiny, and were even ready to rescue the\nprisoner out of the hangman\u2019s hands, he caused the torturing to cease,\nand afterwards privately caused him to be thrown into the sea.--[Diod.\nSic., xiv. 29.]\n\nMan (in good earnest) is a marvellous vain, fickle, and unstable subject,\nand on whom it is very hard to form any certain and uniform judgment.\nFor Pompey could pardon the whole city of the Mamertines, though\nfuriously incensed against it, upon the single account of the virtue and\nmagnanimity of one citizen, Zeno,--[Plutarch calls him Stheno, and also\nSthemnus and Sthenis]--who took the fault of the public wholly upon\nhimself; neither entreated other favour, but alone to undergo the\npunishment for all: and yet Sylla\u2019s host, having in the city of Perugia\n--[Plutarch says Preneste, a town of Latium.]--manifested the same\nvirtue, obtained nothing by it, either for himself or his\nfellow-citizens.\n\nAnd, directly contrary to my first examples, the bravest of all men, and\nwho was reputed so gracious to all those he overcame, Alexander, having,\nafter many great difficulties, forced the city of Gaza, and, entering,\nfound Betis, who commanded there, and of whose valour in the time of this\nsiege he had most marvellous manifest proof, alone, forsaken by all his\nsoldiers, his armour hacked and hewed to pieces, covered all over with\nblood and wounds, and yet still fighting in the crowd of a number of\nMacedonians, who were laying on him on all sides, he said to him, nettled\nat so dear-bought a victory (for, in addition to the other damage, he had\ntwo wounds newly received in his own person), \u201cThou shalt not die, Betis,\nas thou dost intend; be sure thou shall suffer all the torments that can\nbe inflicted on a captive.\u201d  To which menace the other returning no other\nanswer, but only a fierce and disdainful look; \u201cWhat,\u201d says Alexander,\nobserving his haughty and obstinate silence, \u201cis he too stiff to bend a\nknee!  Is he too proud to utter one suppliant word!  Truly, I will\nconquer this silence; and if I cannot force a word from his mouth, I\nwill, at least, extract a groan from his heart.\u201d  And thereupon\nconverting his anger into fury, presently commanded his heels to be bored\nthrough, causing him, alive, to be dragged, mangled, and dismembered at a\ncart\u2019s tail.--[Quintus Curtius, iv. 6.  This act of cruelty has been\ndoubted, notwithstanding the statement of Curtius.]--Was it that the\nheight of courage was so natural and familiar to this conqueror, that\nbecause he could not admire, he respected it the less?  Or was it that he\nconceived valour to be a virtue so peculiar to himself, that his pride\ncould not, without envy, endure it in another?  Or was it that the\nnatural impetuosity of his fury was incapable of opposition?  Certainly,\nhad it been capable of moderation, it is to be believed that in the sack\nand desolation of Thebes, to see so many valiant men, lost and totally\ndestitute of any further defence, cruelly massacred before his eyes,\nwould have appeased it: where there were above six thousand put to the\nsword, of whom not one was seen to fly, or heard to cry out for quarter;\nbut, on the contrary, every one running here and there to seek out and to\nprovoke the victorious enemy to help them to an honourable end.  Not one\nwas seen who, however weakened with wounds, did not in his last gasp yet\nendeavour to revenge himself, and with all the arms of a brave despair,\nto sweeten his own death in the death of an enemy.  Yet did their valour\ncreate no pity, and the length of one day was not enough to satiate the\nthirst of the conqueror\u2019s revenge, but the slaughter continued to the\nlast drop of blood that was capable of being shed, and stopped not till\nit met with none but unarmed persons, old men, women, and children, of\nthem to carry away to the number of thirty thousand slaves.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nOF SORROW\n\nNo man living is more free from this passion than I, who yet neither like\nit in myself nor admire it in others, and yet generally the world, as a\nsettled thing, is pleased to grace it with a particular esteem, clothing\ntherewith wisdom, virtue, and conscience.  Foolish and sordid guise!\n--[\u201cNo man is more free from this passion than I, for I neither love nor\nregard it: albeit the world hath undertaken, as it were upon covenant, to\ngrace it with a particular favour.  Therewith they adorne age, vertue,\nand conscience.  Oh foolish and base ornament!\u201d  Florio, 1613, p. 3]\n--The Italians have more fitly baptized by this name--[La tristezza]--\nmalignity; for \u2018tis a quality always hurtful, always idle and vain; and\nas being cowardly, mean, and base, it is by the Stoics expressly and\nparticularly forbidden to their sages.\n\nBut the story--[Herodotus, iii.  14.]--says that Psammenitus, King of\nEgypt, being defeated and taken prisoner by Cambyses, King of Persia,\nseeing his own daughter pass by him as prisoner, and in a wretched habit,\nwith a bucket to draw water, though his friends about him were so\nconcerned as to break out into tears and lamentations, yet he himself\nremained unmoved, without uttering a word, his eyes fixed upon the\nground; and seeing, moreover, his son immediately after led to execution,\nstill maintained the same countenance; till spying at last one of his\ndomestic and familiar friends dragged away amongst the captives, he fell\nto tearing his hair and beating his breast, with all the other\nextravagances of extreme sorrow.\n\nA story that may very fitly be coupled with another of the same kind, of\nrecent date, of a prince of our own nation, who being at Trent, and\nhaving news there brought him of the death of his elder brother, a\nbrother on whom depended the whole support and honour of his house, and\nsoon after of that of a younger brother, the second hope of his family,\nand having withstood these two assaults with an exemplary resolution; one\nof his servants happening a few days after to die, he suffered his\nconstancy to be overcome by this last accident; and, parting with his\ncourage, so abandoned himself to sorrow and mourning, that some thence\nwere forward to conclude that he was only touched to the quick by this\nlast stroke of fortune; but, in truth, it was, that being before brimful\nof grief, the least addition overflowed the bounds of all patience.\nWhich, I think, might also be said of the former example, did not the\nstory proceed to tell us that Cambyses asking Psammenitus, \u201cWhy, not\nbeing moved at the calamity of his son and daughter, he should with so\ngreat impatience bear the misfortune of his friend?\u201d  \u201cIt is,\u201d answered\nhe, \u201cbecause only this last affliction was to be manifested by tears, the\ntwo first far exceeding all manner of expression.\u201d\n\nAnd, peradventure, something like this might be working in the fancy of\nthe ancient painter,--[Cicero, De Orator., c. 22 ; Pliny, xxxv. 10.]--\nwho having, in the sacrifice of Iphigenia, to represent the sorrow of the\nassistants proportionably to the several degrees of interest every one\nhad in the death of this fair innocent virgin, and having, in the other\nfigures, laid out the utmost power of his art, when he came to that of\nher father, he drew him with a veil over his face, meaning thereby that\nno kind of countenance was capable of expressing such a degree of sorrow.\nWhich is also the reason why the poets feign the miserable mother, Niobe,\nhaving first lost seven sons, and then afterwards as many daughters\n(overwhelmed with her losses), to have been at last transformed into a\nrock--\n\n               \u201cDiriguisse malis,\u201d\n\n     [\u201cPetrified with her misfortunes.\u201d--Ovid, Met., vi. 304.]\n\nthereby to express that melancholic, dumb, and deaf stupefaction, which\nbenumbs all our faculties, when oppressed with accidents greater than we\nare able to bear.  And, indeed, the violence and impression of an\nexcessive grief must of necessity astonish the soul, and wholly deprive\nher of her ordinary functions: as it happens to every one of us, who,\nupon any sudden alarm of very ill news, find ourselves surprised,\nstupefied, and in a manner deprived of all power of motion, so that the\nsoul, beginning to vent itself in tears and lamentations, seems to free\nand disengage itself from the sudden oppression, and to have obtained\nsome room to work itself out at greater liberty.\n\n          \u201cEt via vix tandem voci laxata dolore est.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cAnd at length and with difficulty is a passage opened by grief for\n     utterance.\u201d--AEneid, xi. 151.]\n\nIn the war that Ferdinand made upon the widow of King John of Hungary,\nabout Buda, a man-at-arms was particularly taken notice of by every one\nfor his singular gallant behaviour in a certain encounter; and, unknown,\nhighly commended, and lamented, being left dead upon the place: but by\nnone so much as by Raisciac, a German lord, who was infinitely enamoured\nof so rare a valour.  The body being brought off, and the count, with the\ncommon curiosity coming to view it, the armour was no sooner taken off\nbut he immediately knew him to be his own son, a thing that added a\nsecond blow to the compassion of all the beholders; only he, without\nuttering a word, or turning away his eyes from the woeful object, stood\nfixedly contemplating the body of his son, till the vehemency of sorrow\nhaving overcome his vital spirits, made him sink down stone-dead to the\nground.\n\n          \u201cChi puo dir com\u2019 egli arde, a in picciol fuoco,\u201d\n\n     [\u201cHe who can say how he burns with love, has little fire\u201d\n      --Petrarca, Sonetto 137.]\n\nsay the Innamoratos, when they would represent an \u2018insupportable passion.\n\n                         \u201cMisero quod omneis\n               Eripit sensus mihi: nam simul te,\n               Lesbia, aspexi, nihil est super mi,\n                         Quod loquar amens.\n               Lingua sed torpet: tenuis sub artus\n               Flamma dimanat; sonitu suopte\n               Tintinant aures; gemina teguntur\n                         Lumina nocte.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cLove deprives me of all my faculties: Lesbia, when once in thy\n     presence, I have not left the power to tell my distracting passion:\n     my tongue becomes torpid; a subtle flame creeps through my veins; my\n     ears tingle in deafness; my eyes are veiled with darkness.\u201d\n      Catullus, Epig. li. 5]\n\nNeither is it in the height and greatest fury of the fit that we are in a\ncondition to pour out our complaints or our amorous persuasions, the soul\nbeing at that time over-burdened, and labouring with profound thoughts;\nand the body dejected and languishing with desire; and thence it is that\nsometimes proceed those accidental impotencies that so unseasonably\nsurprise the lover, and that frigidity which by the force of an\nimmoderate ardour seizes him even in the very lap of fruition.\n--[The edition of 1588 has here, \u201cAn accident not unknown to myself.\u201d]--\nFor all passions that suffer themselves to be relished and digested are\nbut moderate:\n\n               \u201cCurae leves loquuntur, ingentes stupent.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cLight griefs can speak: deep sorrows are dumb.\u201d\n      --Seneca, Hippolytus, act ii. scene 3.]\n\nA surprise of unexpected joy does likewise often produce the same effect:\n\n               \u201cUt me conspexit venientem, et Troja circum\n               Arma amens vidit, magnis exterrita monstris,\n               Diriguit visu in medio, calor ossa reliquit,\n               Labitur, et longo vix tandem tempore fatur.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cWhen she beheld me advancing, and saw, with stupefaction, the\n     Trojan arms around me, terrified with so great a prodigy, she\n     fainted away at the very sight: vital warmth forsook her limbs: she\n     sinks down, and, after a long interval, with difficulty speaks.\u201d--\n     AEneid, iii. 306.]\n\nBesides the examples of the Roman lady, who died for joy to see her son\nsafe returned from the defeat of Cannae; and of Sophocles and of\nDionysius the Tyrant,--[Pliny, vii.  53.  Diodorus Siculus, however (xv.\nc. 20), tells us that Dionysius \u201cwas so overjoyed at the news that he\nmade a great sacrifice upon it to the gods, prepared sumptuous feasts, to\nwhich he invited all his friends, and therein drank so excessively that\nit threw him into a very bad distemper.\u201d]--who died of joy; and of\nThalna, who died in Corsica, reading news of the honours the Roman Senate\nhad decreed in his favour, we have, moreover, one in our time, of Pope\nLeo X., who upon news of the taking of Milan, a thing he had so ardently\ndesired, was rapt with so sudden an excess of joy that he immediately\nfell into a fever and died.--[Guicciardini, Storia d\u2019Italia, vol.\nxiv.]--And for a more notable testimony of the imbecility of human\nnature, it is recorded by the ancients--[Pliny, \u2018ut supra\u2019]--that\nDiodorus the dialectician died upon the spot, out of an extreme passion\nof shame, for not having been able in his own school, and in the presence\nof a great auditory, to disengage himself from a nice argument that was\npropounded to him.  I, for my part, am very little subject to these\nviolent passions; I am naturally of a stubborn apprehension, which also,\nby reasoning, I every day harden and fortify.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nTHAT OUR AFFECTIONS CARRY THEMSELVES BEYOND US\n\nSuch as accuse mankind of the folly of gaping after future things, and\nadvise us to make our benefit of those which are present, and to set up\nour rest upon them, as having no grasp upon that which is to come, even\nless than that which we have upon what is past, have hit upon the most\nuniversal of human errors, if that may be called an error to which nature\nherself has disposed us, in order to the continuation of her own work,\nprepossessing us, amongst several others, with this deceiving\nimagination, as being more jealous of our action than afraid of our\nknowledge.\n\nWe are never present with, but always beyond ourselves: fear, desire,\nhope, still push us on towards the future, depriving us, in the meantime,\nof the sense and consideration of that which is to amuse us with the\nthought of what shall be, even when we shall be no more.--[Rousseau,\nEmile, livre ii.]\n\n          \u201cCalamitosus est animus futuri auxius.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThe mind anxious about the future is unhappy.\u201d\n      --Seneca, Epist., 98.]\n\nWe find this great precept often repeated in Plato, \u201cDo thine own work,\nand know thyself.\u201d  Of which two parts, both the one and the other\ngenerally, comprehend our whole duty, and do each of them in like manner\ninvolve the other; for who will do his own work aright will find that his\nfirst lesson is to know what he is, and that which is proper to himself;\nand who rightly understands himself will never mistake another man\u2019s work\nfor his own, but will love and improve himself above all other things,\nwill refuse superfluous employments, and reject all unprofitable thoughts\nand propositions.  As folly, on the one side, though it should enjoy all\nit desire, would notwithstanding never be content, so, on the other,\nwisdom, acquiescing in the present, is never dissatisfied with itself.\n--[Cicero, Tusc.  Quae., 57, v. 18.]--Epicurus dispenses his sages from\nall foresight and care of the future.\n\nAmongst those laws that relate to the dead, I look upon that to be very\nsound by which the actions of princes are to be examined after their\ndecease.--[Diodorus Siculus, i. 6.]-- They are equals with, if not\nmasters of the laws, and, therefore, what justice could not inflict upon\ntheir persons, \u2018tis but reason should be executed upon their reputations\nand the estates of their successors--things that we often value above\nlife itself.  \u2018Tis a custom of singular advantage to those countries\nwhere it is in use, and by all good princes to be desired, who have\nreason to take it ill, that the memories of the wicked should be used\nwith the same reverence and respect with their own.  We owe subjection\nand obedience to all our kings, whether good or bad, alike, for that has\nrespect unto their office; but as to esteem and affection, these are only\ndue to their virtue.  Let us grant to political government to endure them\nwith patience, however unworthy; to conceal their vices; and to assist\nthem with our recommendation in their indifferent actions, whilst their\nauthority stands in need of our support.  But, the relation of prince and\nsubject being once at an end, there is no reason we should deny the\nexpression of our real opinions to our own liberty and common justice,\nand especially to interdict to good subjects the glory of having\nreverently and faithfully served a prince, whose imperfections were to\nthem so well known; this were to deprive posterity of a useful example.\nAnd such as, out of respect to some private obligation, unjustly espouse\nand vindicate the memory of a faulty prince, do private right at the\nexpense of public justice.  Livy does very truly say,--[xxxv. 48.]--\n\u201cThat the language of men bred up in courts is always full of vain\nostentation and false testimony, every one indifferently magnifying his\nown master, and stretching his commendation to the utmost extent of\nvirtue and sovereign grandeur.\u201d  Some may condemn the freedom of those\ntwo soldiers who so roundly answered Nero to his beard; the one being\nasked by him why he bore him ill-will?  \u201cI loved thee,\u201d answered he,\n\u201cwhilst thou wert worthy of it, but since thou art become a parricide, an\nincendiary, a player, and a coachman, I hate thee as thou dost deserve.\u201d\n And the other, why he should attempt to kill him?  \u201cBecause,\u201d said he,\n\u201cI could think of no other remedy against thy perpetual mischiefs.\u201d\n --[Tacitus, Annal., xv. 67.]--But the public and universal testimonies\nthat were given of him after his death (and so will be to all posterity,\nboth of him and all other wicked princes like him), of his tyrannies and\nabominable deportment, who, of a sound judgment, can reprove them?\n\nI am scandalised, that in so sacred a government as that of the\nLacedaemonians there should be mixed so hypocritical a ceremony at the\ninterment of their kings; where all their confederates and neighbours,\nand all sorts and degrees of men and women, as well as their slaves, cut\nand slashed their foreheads in token of sorrow, repeating in their cries\nand lamentations that that king (let him have been as wicked as the\ndevil) was the best that ever they had;--[Herodotus, vi.  68.]--by this\nmeans attributing to his quality the praise that only belongs to merit,\nand that of right is due to supreme desert, though lodged in the lowest\nand most inferior subject.\n\nAristotle, who will still have a hand in everything, makes a \u2018quaere\u2019\nupon the saying of Solon, that none can be said to be happy until he is\ndead: \u201cwhether, then, he who has lived and died according to his heart\u2019s\ndesire, if he have left an ill repute behind him, and that his posterity\nbe miserable, can be said to be happy?\u201d  Whilst we have life and motion,\nwe convey ourselves by fancy and preoccupation, whither and to what we\nplease; but once out of being, we have no more any manner of\ncommunication with that which is, and it had therefore been better said\nby Solon that man is never happy, because never so, till he is no more.\n\n                              \u201cQuisquam\n          Vix radicitus e vita se tollit, et eicit;\n          Sed facit esse sui quiddam super inscius ipse,\n          Nec removet satis a projecto corpore sese, et\n          Vindicat.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cScarcely one man can, even in dying, wholly detach himself from\n     the idea of life; in his ignorance he must needs imagine that there\n     is in him something that survives him, and cannot sufficiently\n     separate or emancipate himself from his remains\u201d\n      --Lucretius, iii. 890.]\n\nBertrand de Guesclin, dying at the siege of the Castle of Rancon, near\nunto Puy, in Auvergne, the besieged were afterwards, upon surrender,\nenjoined to lay down the keys of the place upon the corpse of the dead\ngeneral.  Bartolommeo d\u2019Alviano, the Venetian General, happening to die\nin the service of the Republic in Brescia, and his corpse being to be\ncarried through the territory of Verona, an enemy\u2019s country, most of the\narmy were inclined to demand safe-conduct from the Veronese; but Theodoro\nTrivulzio opposed the motion, rather choosing to make his way by force of\narms, and to run the hazard of a battle, saying it was by no means fit\nthat he who in his life was never afraid of his enemies should seem to\napprehend them when he was dead.  In truth, in affairs of the same\nnature, by the Greek laws, he who made suit to an enemy for a body to\ngive it burial renounced his victory, and had no more right to erect a\ntrophy, and he to whom such suit was made was reputed victor.  By this\nmeans it was that Nicias lost the advantage he had visibly obtained over\nthe Corinthians, and that Agesilaus, on the contrary, assured that which\nhe had before very doubtfully gained over the Boeotians.--[Plutarch,\nLife of Nicias, c. ii.; Life of Agesilaus, c. vi.]\n\nThese things might appear strange, had it not been a general practice in\nall ages not only to extend the concern of ourselves beyond this life,\nbut, moreover, to fancy that the favour of Heaven does not only very\noften accompany us to the grave, but has also, even after life, a concern\nfor our ashes.  Of which there are so many ancient examples (to say\nnothing of those of our own observation), that it is not necessary I\nshould longer insist upon it.  Edward I., King of England, having in the\nlong wars betwixt him and Robert, King of Scotland, had experience of how\ngreat importance his own immediate presence was to the success of his\naffairs, having ever been victorious in whatever he undertook in his own\nperson, when he came to die, bound his son in a solemn oath that, so soon\nas he should be dead he should boil his body till the flesh parted from\nthe bones, and bury the flesh, reserving the bones to carry continually\nwith him in his army, so often as he should be obliged to go against the\nScots, as if destiny had inevitably attached victory, even to his\nremains.  John Zisca, the same who, to vindication of Wicliffe\u2019s\nheresies, troubled the Bohemian state, left order that they should flay\nhim after his death, and of his skin make a drum to carry in the war\nagainst his enemies, fancying it would contribute to the continuation of\nthe successes he had always obtained in the wars against them.  In like\nmanner certain of the Indians, in their battles with the Spaniards,\ncarried with them the bones of one of their captains, in consideration of\nthe victories they had formerly obtained under his conduct.  And other\npeople of the same New World carry about with them, in their wars, the\nrelics of valiant men who have died in battle, to incite their courage\nand advance their fortune.  Of which examples the first reserve nothing\nfor the tomb but the reputation they have acquired by their former\nachievements, but these attribute to them a certain present and active\npower.\n\nThe proceeding of Captain Bayard is of a better composition, who finding\nhimself wounded to death with an harquebuss shot, and being importuned to\nretire out of the fight, made answer that he would not begin at the last\ngasp to turn his back to the enemy, and accordingly still fought on, till\nfeeling himself too faint and no longer able to sit on his horse, he\ncommanded his steward to set him down at the foot of a tree, but so that\nhe might die with his face towards the enemy, which he did.\n\nI must yet add another example, equally remarkable for the present\nconsideration with any of the former.  The Emperor Maximilian,\ngreat-grandfather to the now King Philip,--[Philip II. of Spain.]--was a\nprince endowed throughout with great and extraordinary qualities, and\namongst the rest with a singular beauty of person, but had withal a\nhumour very contrary to that of other princes, who for the despatch of\ntheir most important affairs convert their close-stool into a chair of\nState, which was, that he would never permit any of his bedchamber, how\nfamiliar soever, to see him in that posture, and would steal aside to\nmake water as religiously as a virgin, shy to discover to his physician\nor any other whomsoever those parts that we are accustomed to conceal.\nI myself, who have so impudent a way of talking, am, nevertheless,\nnaturally so modest this way, that unless at the importunity of necessity\nor pleasure, I scarcely ever communicate to the sight of any either those\nparts or actions that custom orders us to conceal, wherein I suffer more\nconstraint than I conceive is very well becoming a man, especially of my\nprofession.  But he nourished this modest humour to such a degree of\nsuperstition as to give express orders in his last will that they should\nput him on drawers so soon as he should be dead; to which, methinks, he\nwould have done well to have added that he should be blindfolded, too,\nthat put them on.  The charge that Cyrus left with his children, that\nneither they, nor any other, should either see or touch his body after\nthe soul was departed from it,--[Xenophon, Cyropedia, viii. 7.]--I\nattribute to some superstitious devotion of his; for both his historian\nand himself, amongst their great qualities, marked the whole course of\ntheir lives with a singular respect and reverence to religion.\n\nI was by no means pleased with a story, told me by a man of very great\nquality of a relation of mine, and one who had given a very good account\nof himself both in peace and war, that, coming to die in a very old age,\nof excessive pain of the stone, he spent the last hours of his life in an\nextraordinary solicitude about ordering the honour and ceremony of his\nfuneral, pressing all the men of condition who came to see him to engage\ntheir word to attend him to his grave: importuning this very prince, who\ncame to visit him at his last gasp, with a most earnest supplication that\nhe would order his family to be there, and presenting before him several\nreasons and examples to prove that it was a respect due to a man of his\ncondition; and seemed to die content, having obtained this promise, and\nappointed the method and order of his funeral parade.  I have seldom\nheard of so persistent a vanity.\n\nAnother, though contrary curiosity (of which singularity, also, I do not\nwant domestic example), seems to be somewhat akin to this, that a man\nshall cudgel his brains at the last moments of his life to contrive his\nobsequies to so particular and unusual a parsimony as of one servant with\na lantern, I see this humour commended, and the appointment of Marcus.\nEmilius Lepidus, who forbade his heirs to bestow upon his hearse even the\ncommon ceremonies in use upon such occasions.  Is it yet temperance and\nfrugality to avoid expense and pleasure of which the use and knowledge\nare imperceptible to us?  See, here, an easy and cheap reformation.  If\ninstruction were at all necessary in this case, I should be of opinion\nthat in this, as in all other actions of life, each person should\nregulate the matter according to his fortune; and the philosopher Lycon\nprudently ordered his friends to dispose of his body where they should\nthink most fit, and as to his funeral, to order it neither too\nsuperfluous nor too mean.  For my part, I should wholly refer the\nordering of this ceremony to custom, and shall, when the time comes,\naccordingly leave it to their discretion to whose lot it shall fall to do\nme that last office. \u201cTotus hic locus est contemnendus in nobis, non\nnegligendus in nostris;\u201d--[\u201cThe place of our sepulture is to be contemned\nby us, but not to be neglected by our friends.\u201d--Cicero, Tusc. i. 45.]--\nand it was a holy saying of a saint, \u201cCuratio funeris, conditio\nsepultura: pompa exequiarum, magis sunt vivorum solatia, quam subsidia\nmortuorum.\u201d--[\u201cThe care of death, the place of sepulture, the pomps of\nobsequies, are rather consolations to the living than succours to the\ndead.\u201d August. De Civit. Dei, i.  12.]--Which made Socrates answer\nCrito, who, at death, asked him how he would be buried: \u201cHow you will,\u201d\n said he. \u201cIf I were to concern myself beyond the present about this\naffair, I should be most tempted, as the greatest satisfaction of this\nkind, to imitate those who in their lifetime entertain themselves with\nthe ceremony and honours of their own obsequies beforehand, and are\npleased with beholding their own dead countenance in marble.  Happy are\nthey who can gratify their senses by insensibility, and live by their\ndeath!\u201d\n\nI am ready to conceive an implacable hatred against all popular\ndomination, though I think it the most natural and equitable of all, so\noft as I call to mind the inhuman injustice of the people of Athens, who,\nwithout remission, or once vouchsafing to hear what they had to say for\nthemselves, put to death their brave captains newly returned triumphant\nfrom a naval victory they had obtained over the Lacedaemonians near the\nArginusian Isles, the most bloody and obstinate engagement that ever the\nGreeks fought at sea; because (after the victory) they followed up the\nblow and pursued the advantages presented to them by the rule of war,\nrather than stay to gather up and bury their dead.  And the execution is\nyet rendered more odious by the behaviour of Diomedon, who, being one of\nthe condemned, and a man of most eminent virtue, political and military,\nafter having heard the sentence, advancing to speak, no audience till\nthen having been allowed, instead of laying before them his own cause,\nor the impiety of so cruel a sentence, only expressed a solicitude for\nhis judges\u2019 preservation, beseeching the gods to convert this sentence to\ntheir good, and praying that, for neglecting to fulfil the vows which he\nand his companions had made (with which he also acquainted them) in\nacknowledgment of so glorious a success, they might not draw down the\nindignation of the gods upon them; and so without more words went\ncourageously to his death.\n\nFortune, a few years after, punished them in the same kind; for Chabrias,\ncaptain-general of their naval forces, having got the better of Pollis,\nAdmiral of Sparta, at the Isle of Naxos, totally lost the fruits of his\nvictory, one of very great importance to their affairs, in order not to\nincur the danger of this example, and so that he should not lose a few\nbodies of his dead friends that were floating in the sea, gave\nopportunity to a world of living enemies to sail away in safety, who\nafterwards made them pay dear for this unseasonable superstition:--\n\n               \u201cQuaeris, quo jaceas, post obitum, loco?\n                    Quo non nata jacent.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cDost ask where thou shalt lie after death?\n     Where things not born lie, that never being had.\u201d]\n                                   Seneca, Tyoa. Choro ii. 30.\n\n\nThis other restores the sense of repose to a body without a soul:\n\n     \u201cNeque sepulcrum, quo recipiatur, habeat: portum corporis, ubi,\n     remissa human, vita, corpus requiescat a malis.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cNor let him have a sepulchre wherein he may be received, a haven\n     for his body, where, life being gone, that body may rest from its\n     woes.\u201d--Ennius, ap.  Cicero, Tusc.  i.  44.]\n\nAs nature demonstrates to us that several dead things retain yet an\noccult relation to life; wine changes its flavour and complexion in\ncellars, according to the changes and seasons of the vine from whence it\ncame; and the flesh of--venison alters its condition in the\npowdering-tub, and its taste according to the laws of the living\nflesh of its kind, as it is said.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nTHAT THE SOUL EXPENDS ITS PASSIONS UPON FALSE OBJECTS, WHERE THE TRUE ARE\nWANTING\n\nA gentleman of my country, marvellously tormented with the gout, being\nimportuned by his physicians totally to abstain from all manner of salt\nmeats, was wont pleasantly to reply, that in the extremity of his fits he\nmust needs have something to quarrel with, and that railing at and\ncursing, one while the Bologna sausages, and another the dried tongues\nand the hams, was some mitigation to his pain.  But, in good earnest, as\nthe arm when it is advanced to strike, if it miss the blow, and goes by\nthe wind, it pains us; and as also, that, to make a pleasant prospect,\nthe sight should not be lost and dilated in vague air, but have some\nbound and object to limit and circumscribe it at a reasonable distance.\n\n         \u201cVentus ut amittit vires, nisi robore densa\n          Occurrant sylvae, spatio diffusus inani.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cAs the wind loses its force diffused in void space, unless it in\n     its strength encounters the thick wood.\u201d--Lucan, iii.  362.]\n\nSo it seems that the soul, being transported and discomposed, turns its\nviolence upon itself, if not supplied with something to oppose it, and\ntherefore always requires an object at which to aim, and whereon to act.\nPlutarch says of those who are delighted with little dogs and monkeys,\nthat the amorous part that is in us, for want of a legitimate object,\nrather than lie idle, does after that manner forge and create one false\nand frivolous.  And we see that the soul, in its passions, inclines\nrather to deceive itself, by creating a false and fantastical a subject,\neven contrary to its own belief, than not to have something to work upon.\nAfter this manner brute beasts direct their fury to fall upon the stone\nor weapon that has hurt them, and with their teeth a even execute revenge\nupon themselves for the injury they have received from another:\n\n         \u201cPannonis haud aliter, post ictum saevior ursa,\n          Cui jaculum parva Lybis amentavit habena,\n          Se rotat in vulnus, telumque irata receptum\n          Impetit, et secum fugientem circuit hastam.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cSo the she-bear, fiercer after the blow from the Lybian\u2019s thong-\n     hurled dart, turns round upon the wound, and attacking the received\n     spear, twists it, as she flies.\u201d--Lucan, vi. 220.]\n\nWhat causes of the misadventures that befall us do we not invent?  what\nis it that we do not lay the fault to, right or wrong, that we may have\nsomething to quarrel with?  It is not those beautiful tresses you tear,\nnor is it the white bosom that in your anger you so unmercifully beat,\nthat with an unlucky bullet have slain your beloved brother; quarrel with\nsomething else.  Livy, speaking of the Roman army in Spain, says that for\nthe loss of the two brothers, their great captains:\n\n          \u201cFlere omnes repente, et offensare capita.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cAll at once wept and tore their hair.\u201d-Livy, xxv.  37.]\n\n\u2018Tis a common practice.  And the philosopher Bion said pleasantly of the\nking, who by handsful pulled his hair off his head for sorrow, \u201cDoes this\nman think that baldness is a remedy for grief?\u201d--[Cicero, Tusc.  Quest.,\niii.  26.]--Who has not seen peevish gamesters chew and swallow the\ncards, and swallow the dice, in revenge for the loss of their money?\nXerxes whipped the sea, and wrote a challenge to Mount Athos; Cyrus\nemployed a whole army several days at work, to revenge himself of the\nriver Gyndas, for the fright it had put him into in passing over it; and\nCaligula demolished a very beautiful palace for the pleasure his mother\nhad once enjoyed there.\n\n     --[Pleasure--unless \u2018plaisir\u2019 were originally \u2018deplaisir\u2019--must be\n     understood here ironically, for the house was one in which she had\n     been imprisoned.--Seneca, De Ira. iii. 22]--\n\nI remember there was a story current, when I was a boy, that one of our\nneighbouring kings--[Probably Alfonso XI.  of Castile]--having received\na blow from the hand of God, swore he would be revenged, and in order to\nit, made proclamation that for ten years to come no one should pray to\nHim, or so much as mention Him throughout his dominions, or, so far as\nhis authority went, believe in Him; by which they meant to paint not so\nmuch the folly as the vainglory of the nation of which this tale was\ntold.  They are vices that always go together, but in truth such actions\nas these have in them still more of presumption than want of wit.\nAugustus Caesar, having been tossed with a tempest at sea, fell to\ndefying Neptune, and in the pomp of the Circensian games, to be revenged,\ndeposed his statue from the place it had amongst the other deities.\nWherein he was still less excusable than the former, and less than he was\nafterwards when, having lost a battle under Quintilius Varus in Germany,\nin rage and despair he went running his head against the wall, crying\nout, \u201cO Varus!  give me back my legions!\u201d for these exceed all folly,\nforasmuch as impiety is joined therewith, invading God Himself, or at\nleast Fortune, as if she had ears that were subject to our batteries;\nlike the Thracians, who when it thunders or lightens, fall to shooting\nagainst heaven with Titanian vengeance, as if by flights of arrows they\nintended to bring God to reason.  Though the ancient poet in Plutarch\ntells us--\n\n              \u201cPoint ne se faut couroucer aux affaires,\n               Il ne leur chault de toutes nos choleres.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cWe must not trouble the gods with our affairs; they take no heed\n     of our angers and disputes.\u201d--Plutarch.]\n\nBut we can never enough decry the disorderly sallies of our minds.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nWHETHER THE GOVERNOR OF A PLACE BESIEGED OUGHT HIMSELF\nTO GO OUT TO PARLEY\n\nQuintus Marcius, the Roman legate in the war against Perseus, King of\nMacedon, to gain time wherein to reinforce his army, set on foot some\novertures of accommodation, with which the king being lulled asleep,\nconcluded a truce for some days, by this means giving his enemy\nopportunity and leisure to recruit his forces, which was afterwards the\noccasion of the king\u2019s final ruin.  Yet the elder senators, mindful of\ntheir forefathers\u2019 manners, condemned this proceeding as degenerating\nfrom their ancient practice, which, they said, was to fight by valour,\nand not by artifice, surprises, and night-encounters; neither by\npretended flight nor unexpected rallies to overcome their enemies; never\nmaking war till having first proclaimed it, and very often assigned both\nthe hour and place of battle.  Out of this generous principle it was that\nthey delivered up to Pyrrhus his treacherous physician, and to the\nEtrurians their disloyal schoolmaster.  This was, indeed, a procedure\ntruly Roman, and nothing allied to the Grecian subtlety, nor to the Punic\ncunning, where it was reputed a victory of less glory to overcome by\nforce than by fraud.  Deceit may serve for a need, but he only confesses\nhimself overcome who knows he is neither subdued by policy nor\nmisadventure, but by dint of valour, man to man, in a fair and just war.\nIt very well appears, by the discourse of these good old senators, that\nthis fine sentence was not yet received amongst them.\n\n               \u201cDolus, an virtus, quis in hoste requirat?\u201d\n\n     [\u201cWhat matters whether by valour or by strategem we overcome the\n     enemy?\u201d--Aeneid, ii. 390]\n\nThe Achaians, says Polybius, abhorred all manner of double-dealing in\nwar, not reputing it a victory unless where the courage of the enemy was\nfairly subdued:\n\n\u201cEam vir sanctus et sapiens sciet veram esse victoriam, quae, salva fide\net integra dignitate, parabitur.\u201d--[\u201cAn honest and prudent man will\nacknowledge that only to be a true victory which shall be obtained saving\nhis own good faith and dignity.\u201d--Florus, i.  12.]--Says another:\n\n          \u201cVosne velit, an me, regnare hera, quidve ferat,\n          fors virtute experiamur.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cWhether you or I shall rule, or what shall happen, let us\n     determine by valour.\u201d--Cicero, De Offic., i. 12]\n\nIn the kingdom of Ternate, amongst those nations which we so broadly call\nbarbarians, they have a custom never to commence war, till it be first\nproclaimed; adding withal an ample declaration of what means they have to\ndo it with, with what and how many men, what ammunitions, and what, both\noffensive and defensive, arms; but also, that being done, if their\nenemies do not yield and come to an agreement, they conceive it lawful to\nemploy without reproach in their wars any means which may help them to\nconquer.\n\nThe ancient Florentines were so far from seeking to obtain any advantage\nover their enemies by surprise, that they always gave them a month\u2019s\nwarning before they drew their army into the field, by the continual\ntolling of a bell they called Martinella.--[After St. Martin.]\n\nFor what concerns ourselves, who are not so scrupulous in this affair,\nand who attribute the honour of the war to him who has the profit of it,\nand who after Lysander say, \u201cWhere the lion\u2019s skin is too short, we must\neke it out with a bit from that of a fox\u201d; the most usual occasions of\nsurprise are derived from this practice, and we hold that there are no\nmoments wherein a chief ought to be more circumspect, and to have his eye\nso much at watch, as those of parleys and treaties of accommodation; and\nit is, therefore, become a general rule amongst the martial men of these\nlatter times, that a governor of a place never ought, in a time of siege,\nto go out to parley.  It was for this that in our fathers\u2019 days the\nSeigneurs de Montmord and de l\u2019Assigni, defending Mousson against the\nCount of Nassau, were so highly censured.  But yet, as to this, it would\nbe excusable in that governor who, going out, should, notwithstanding,\ndo it in such manner that the safety and advantage should be on his side;\nas Count Guido di Rangone did at Reggio (if we are to believe Du Bellay,\nfor Guicciardini says it was he himself) when the Seigneur de l\u2019Escut\napproached to parley, who stepped so little away from his fort, that a\ndisorder happening in the interim of parley, not only Monsieur de l\u2019Escut\nand his party who were advanced with him, found themselves by much the\nweaker, insomuch that Alessandro Trivulcio was there slain, but he\nhimself follow the Count, and, relying upon his honour, to secure himself\nfrom the danger of the shot within the walls of the town.\n\nEumenes, being shut up in the city of Nora by Antigonus, and by him\nimportuned to come out to speak with him, as he sent him word it was fit\nhe should to a greater man than himself, and one who had now an advantage\nover him, returned this noble answer.  \u201cTell him,\u201d said he, \u201cthat I shall\nnever think any man greater than myself whilst I have my sword in my\nhand,\u201d and would not consent to come out to him till first, according to\nhis own demand, Antigonus had delivered him his own nephew Ptolomeus in\nhostage.\n\nAnd yet some have done very well in going out in person to parley, on the\nword of the assailant: witness Henry de Vaux, a cavalier of Champagne,\nwho being besieged by the English in the Castle of Commercy, and\nBartholomew de Brunes, who commanded at the Leaguer, having so sapped the\ngreatest part of the castle without, that nothing remained but setting\nfire to the props to bury the besieged under the ruins, he requested the\nsaid Henry to come out to speak with him for his own good, which he did\nwith three more in company; and, his ruin being made apparent to him, he\nconceived himself singularly obliged to his enemy, to whose discretion he\nand his garrison surrendered themselves; and fire being presently applied\nto the mine, the props no sooner began to fail, but the castle was\nimmediately blown up from its foundations, no one stone being left upon\nanother.\n\nI could, and do, with great facility, rely upon the faith of another; but\nI should very unwillingly do it in such a case, as it should thereby be\njudged that it was rather an effect of my despair and want of courage\nthan voluntarily and out of confidence and security in the faith of him\nwith whom I had to do.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nTHAT THE HOUR OF PARLEY DANGEROUS\n\nI saw, notwithstanding, lately at Mussidan, a place not far from my\nhouse, that those who were driven out thence by our army, and others of\ntheir party, highly complained of treachery, for that during a treaty of\naccommodation, and in the very interim that their deputies were treating,\nthey were surprised and cut to pieces: a thing that, peradventure, in\nanother age, might have had some colour of foul play; but, as I have just\nsaid, the practice of arms in these days is quite another thing, and\nthere is now no confidence in an enemy excusable till the treaty is\nfinally sealed; and even then the conqueror has enough to do to keep his\nword: so hazardous a thing it is to entrust the observation of the faith\na man has engaged to a town that surrenders upon easy and favourable\nconditions, to the licence of a victorious army, and to give the soldier\nfree entrance into it in the heat of blood.\n\nLucius AEmilius Regillus, the Roman praetor, having lost his time in\nattempting to take the city of Phocaea by force, by reason of the\nsingular valour wherewith the inhabitants defended themselves,\nconditioned, at last, to receive them as friends to the people of Rome,\nand to enter the town, as into a confederate city, without any manner of\nhostility, of which he gave them all assurance; but having, for the\ngreater pomp, brought his whole army in with him, it was no more in his\npower, with all the endeavour he could use, to restrain his people: so\nthat, avarice and revenge trampling under foot both his authority and all\nmilitary discipline, he there saw a considerable part of the city sacked\nand ruined before his face.\n\nCleomenes was wont to say, \u201cthat what mischief soever a man could do his\nenemy in time of war was above justice, and nothing accountable to it in\nthe sight of gods and men.\u201d  And so, having concluded a truce with those\nof Argos for seven days, the third night after he fell upon them when\nthey were all buried in sleep, and put them to the sword, alleging that\nthere had no nights been mentioned in the truce; but the gods punished\nthis subtle perfidy.\n\nIn a time of parley also; and while the citizens were relying upon their\nsafety warrant, the city of Casilinum was taken by surprise, and that\neven in the age of the justest captains and the most perfect Roman\nmilitary discipline; for it is not said that it is not lawful for us, in\ntime and place, to make advantage of our enemies\u2019 want of understanding,\nas well as their want of courage.\n\nAnd, doubtless, war has naturally many privileges that appear reasonable\neven to the prejudice of reason.  And therefore here the rule fails,\n\u201cNeminem id agere ut ex alte rius praedetur inscitia.\u201d--[\u201cNo one should\npreys upon another\u2019s folly.\u201d--Cicero, De Offic., iii.  17.]--But I am\nastonished at the great liberty allowed by Xenophon in such cases, and\nthat both by precept and by the example of several exploits of his\ncomplete emperor; an author of very great authority, I confess, in those\naffairs, as being in his own person both a great captain and a\nphilosopher of the first form of Socrates\u2019 disciples; and yet I cannot\nconsent to such a measure of licence as he dispenses in all things and\nplaces.\n\nMonsieur d\u2019Aubigny, besieging Capua, and after having directed a furious\nbattery against it, Signor Fabricio Colonna, governor of the town, having\nfrom a bastion begun to parley, and his soldiers in the meantime being a\nlittle more remiss in their guard, our people entered the place at\nunawares, and put them all to the sword.  And of later memory, at Yvoy,\nSignor Juliano Romero having played that part of a novice to go out to\nparley with the Constable, at his return found his place taken.  But,\nthat we might not scape scot-free, the Marquess of Pescara having laid\nsiege to Genoa, where Duke Ottaviano Fregosa commanded under our\nprotection, and the articles betwixt them being so far advanced that it\nwas looked upon as a done thing, and upon the point to be concluded, the\nSpaniards in the meantime having slipped in, made use of this treachery\nas an absolute victory.  And since, at Ligny, in Barrois, where the Count\nde Brienne commanded, the emperor having in his own person beleaguered\nthat place, and Bertheville, the said Count\u2019s lieutenant, going out to\nparley, whilst he was capitulating the town was taken.\n\n              \u201cFu il vincer sempremai laudabil cosa,\n               Vincasi o per fortuna, o per ingegno,\u201d\n\n     [\u201cVictory is ever worthy of praise, whether obtained by valour or\n     wisdom.\u201d--Ariosto, xv.  I.]\n\nBut the philosopher Chrysippus was of another opinion, wherein I also\nconcur; for he was used to say that those who run a race ought to employ\nall the force they have in what they are about, and to run as fast as\nthey can; but that it is by no means fair in them to lay any hand upon\ntheir adversary to stop him, nor to set a leg before him to throw him\ndown.  And yet more generous was the answer of that great Alexander to\nPolypercon who was persuading him to take the advantage of the night\u2019s\nobscurity to fall upon Darius.  \u201cBy no means,\u201d said be; \u201cit is not for\nsuch a man as I am to steal a victory, \u2018Malo me fortunae poeniteat, quam\nvictoria pudeat.\u2019\u201d--[\u201cI had rather complain of ill-fortune than be\nashamed of victory.\u201d  Quint. Curt, iv. 13]--\n\n         \u201cAtque idem fugientem baud est dignatus Oroden\n          Sternere, nec jacta caecum dare cuspide vulnus\n          Obvius, adversoque occurrit, seque viro vir\n          Contulit, haud furto melior, sed fortibus armis.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cHe deigned not to throw down Orodes as he fled, or with the darted\n     spear to give him a wound unseen; but overtaking him, he confronted\n     him face to face, and encountered man to man: superior, not in\n     stratagem, but in valiant arms.\u201d--AEneid, x.  732.]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nTHAT THE INTENTION IS JUDGE OF OUR ACTIONS\n\n\u2018Tis a saying, \u201cThat death discharges us of all our obligations.\u201d  I know\nsome who have taken it in another sense.  Henry VII., King of England,\narticled with Don Philip, son to Maximilian the emperor, or (to place him\nmore honourably) father to the Emperor Charles V., that the said Philip\nshould deliver up the Duke of Suffolk of the White Rose, his enemy, who\nwas fled into the Low Countries, into his hands; which Philip accordingly\ndid, but upon condition, nevertheless, that Henry should attempt nothing\nagainst the life of the said Duke; but coming to die, the king in his\nlast will commanded his son to put him to death immediately after his\ndecease.  And lately, in the tragedy that the Duke of Alva presented to\nus in the persons of the Counts Horn and Egmont at Brussels,\n--[Decapitated 4th June 1568]--there were very remarkable passages, and\none amongst the rest, that Count Egmont (upon the security of whose word\nand faith Count Horn had come and surrendered himself to the Duke of\nAlva) earnestly entreated that he might first mount the scaffold, to the\nend that death might disengage him from the obligation he had passed to\nthe other.  In which case, methinks, death did not acquit the former of\nhis promise, and that the second was discharged from it without dying.\nWe cannot be bound beyond what we are able to perform, by reason that\neffect and performance are not at all in our power, and that, indeed, we\nare masters of nothing but the will, in which, by necessity, all the\nrules and whole duty of mankind are founded and established: therefore\nCount Egmont, conceiving his soul and will indebted to his promise,\nalthough he had not the power to make it good, had doubtless been\nabsolved of his duty, even though he had outlived the other; but the King\nof England wilfully and premeditately breaking his faith, was no more to\nbe excused for deferring the execution of his infidelity till after his\ndeath than the mason in Herodotus, who having inviolably, during the time\nof his life, kept the secret of the treasure of the King of Egypt, his\nmaster, at his death discovered it to his children.--[Herod., ii.  121.]\n\nI have taken notice of several in my time, who, convicted by their\nconsciences of unjustly detaining the goods of another, have endeavoured\nto make amends by their will, and after their decease; but they had as\ngood do nothing, as either in taking so much time in so pressing an\naffair, or in going about to remedy a wrong with so little\ndissatisfaction or injury to themselves.  They owe, over and above,\nsomething of their own; and by how much their payment is more strict and\nincommodious to themselves, by so much is their restitution more just\nmeritorious.  Penitency requires penalty; but they yet do worse than\nthese, who reserve the animosity against their neighbour to the last\ngasp, having concealed it during their life; wherein they manifest little\nregard of their own honour, irritating the party offended in their\nmemory; and less to their the power, even out of to make their malice die\nwith them, but extending the life of their hatred even beyond their own.\nUnjust judges, who defer judgment to a time wherein they can have no\nknowledge of the cause!  For my part, I shall take care, if I can, that\nmy death discover nothing that my life has not first and openly declared.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nOF IDLENESS\n\nAs we see some grounds that have long lain idle and untilled, when grown\nrich and fertile by rest, to abound with and spend their virtue in the\nproduct of innumerable sorts of weeds and wild herbs that are\nunprofitable, and that to make them perform their true office, we are to\ncultivate and prepare them for such seeds as are proper for our service;\nand as we see women that, without knowledge of man, do sometimes of\nthemselves bring forth inanimate and formless lumps of flesh, but that to\ncause a natural and perfect generation they are to be husbanded with\nanother kind of seed: even so it is with minds, which if not applied to\nsome certain study that may fix and restrain them, run into a thousand\nextravagances, eternally roving here and there in the vague expanse of\nthe imagination--\n\n              \u201cSicut aqua tremulum labris ubi lumen ahenis,\n               Sole repercussum, aut radiantis imagine lunae,\n               Omnia pervolitat late loca; jamque sub auras\n               Erigitur, summique ferit laquearia tecti.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cAs when in brazen vats of water the trembling beams of light,\n     reflected from the sun, or from the image of the radiant moon,\n     swiftly float over every place around, and now are darted up on\n     high, and strike the ceilings of the upmost roof.\u201d--\n     AEneid, viii. 22.]\n\n--in which wild agitation there is no folly, nor idle fancy they do not\nlight upon:--\n\n                    \u201cVelut aegri somnia, vanae\n               Finguntur species.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cAs a sick man\u2019s dreams, creating vain phantasms.\u201d--\n     Hor., De Arte Poetica, 7.]\n\nThe soul that has no established aim loses itself, for, as it is said--\n\n          \u201cQuisquis ubique habitat, Maxime, nusquam habitat.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cHe who lives everywhere, lives nowhere.\u201d--Martial, vii.  73.]\n\nWhen I lately retired to my own house, with a resolution, as much as\npossibly I could, to avoid all manner of concern in affairs, and to spend\nin privacy and repose the little remainder of time I have to live, I\nfancied I could not more oblige my mind than to suffer it at full leisure\nto entertain and divert itself, which I now hoped it might henceforth do,\nas being by time become more settled and mature; but I find--\n\n               \u201cVariam semper dant otia mentem,\u201d\n\n     [\u201cLeisure ever creates varied thought.\u201d--Lucan, iv. 704]\n\nthat, quite contrary, it is like a horse that has broke from his rider,\nwho voluntarily runs into a much more violent career than any horseman\nwould put him to, and creates me so many chimaeras and fantastic\nmonsters, one upon another, without order or design, that, the better at\nleisure to contemplate their strangeness and absurdity, I have begun to\ncommit them to writing, hoping in time to make it ashamed of itself.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nOF LIARS\n\nThere is not a man living whom it would so little become to speak from\nmemory as myself, for I have scarcely any at all, and do not think that\nthe world has another so marvellously treacherous as mine.  My other\nfaculties are all sufficiently ordinary and mean; but in this I think\nmyself very rare and singular, and deserving to be thought famous.\nBesides the natural inconvenience I suffer by it (for, certes, the\nnecessary use of memory considered, Plato had reason when he called it a\ngreat and powerful goddess), in my country, when they would say a man has\nno sense, they say, such an one has no memory; and when I complain of the\ndefect of mine, they do not believe me, and reprove me, as though I\naccused myself for a fool: not discerning the difference betwixt memory\nand understanding, which is to make matters still worse for me.  But they\ndo me wrong; for experience, rather, daily shows us, on the contrary,\nthat a strong memory is commonly coupled with infirm judgment.  They do,\nme, moreover (who am so perfect in nothing as in friendship), a great\nwrong in this, that they make the same words which accuse my infirmity,\nrepresent me for an ungrateful person; they bring my affections into\nquestion upon the account of my memory, and from a natural imperfection,\nmake out a defect of conscience.  \u201cHe has forgot,\u201d says one, \u201cthis\nrequest, or that promise; he no more remembers his friends; he has forgot\nto say or do, or conceal such and such a thing, for my sake.\u201d  And,\ntruly, I am apt enough to forget many things, but to neglect anything my\nfriend has given me in charge, I never do it.  And it should be enough,\nmethinks, that I feel the misery and inconvenience of it, without\nbranding me with malice, a vice so contrary to my humour.\n\nHowever, I derive these comforts from my infirmity: first, that it is an\nevil from which principally I have found reason to correct a worse, that\nwould easily enough have grown upon me, namely, ambition; the defect\nbeing intolerable in those who take upon them public affairs.  That, like\nexamples in the progress of nature demonstrate to us, she has fortified\nme in my other faculties proportionably as she has left me unfurnished in\nthis; I should otherwise have been apt implicitly to have reposed my mind\nand judgment upon the bare report of other men, without ever setting them\nto work upon their own force, had the inventions and opinions of others\nbeen ever been present with me by the benefit of memory.  That by this\nmeans I am not so talkative, for the magazine of the memory is ever\nbetter furnished with matter than that of the invention.  Had mine been\nfaithful to me, I had ere this deafened all my friends with my babble,\nthe subjects themselves arousing and stirring up the little faculty I\nhave of handling and employing them, heating and distending my discourse,\nwhich were a pity: as I have observed in several of my intimate friends,\nwho, as their memories supply them with an entire and full view of\nthings, begin their narrative so far back, and crowd it with so many\nimpertinent circumstances, that though the story be good in itself, they\nmake a shift to spoil it; and if otherwise, you are either to curse the\nstrength of their memory or the weakness of their judgment: and it is a\nhard thing to close up a discourse, and to cut it short, when you have\nonce started; there is nothing wherein the force of a horse is so much\nseen as in a round and sudden stop.  I see even those who are pertinent\nenough, who would, but cannot stop short in their career; for whilst they\nare seeking out a handsome period to conclude with, they go on at random,\nstraggling about upon impertinent trivialities, as men staggering upon\nweak legs.  But, above all, old men who retain the memory of things past,\nand forget how often they have told them, are dangerous company; and I\nhave known stories from the mouth of a man of very great quality,\notherwise very pleasant in themselves, become very wearisome by being\nrepeated a hundred times over and over again to the same people.\n\nSecondly, that, by this means, I the less remember the injuries I have\nreceived; insomuch that, as the ancient said,--[Cicero, Pro Ligar.\nc. 12.]--I should have a register of injuries, or a prompter, as Darius,\nwho, that he might not forget the offence he had received from those of\nAthens, so oft as he sat down to dinner, ordered one of his pages three\ntimes to repeat in his ear, \u201cSir, remember the Athenians\u201d;--[Herod., v.\n105.]--and then, again, the places which I revisit, and the books I read\nover again, still smile upon me with a fresh novelty.\n\nIt is not without good reason said \u201cthat he who has not a good memory\nshould never take upon him the trade of lying.\u201d  I know very well that\nthe grammarians--[Nigidius, Aulus Gellius, xi.  ii; Nonius, v.  80.]--\ndistinguish betwixt an untruth and a lie, and say that to tell an untruth\nis to tell a thing that is false, but that we ourselves believe to be\ntrue; and that the definition of the word to lie in Latin, from which our\nFrench is taken, is to tell a thing which we know in our conscience to be\nuntrue; and it is of this last sort of liars only that I now speak.  Now,\nthese do either wholly contrive and invent the untruths they utter, or so\nalter and disguise a true story that it ends in a lie.  When they\ndisguise and often alter the same story, according to their own fancy,\n\u2018tis very hard for them, at one time or another, to escape being trapped,\nby reason that the real truth of the thing, having first taken possession\nof the memory, and being there lodged impressed by the medium of\nknowledge and science, it will be difficult that it should not represent\nitself to the imagination, and shoulder out falsehood, which cannot there\nhave so sure and settled footing as the other; and the circumstances of\nthe first true knowledge evermore running in their minds, will be apt to\nmake them forget those that are illegitimate, and only, forged by their\nown fancy.  In what they, wholly invent, forasmuch as there is no\ncontrary impression to jostle their invention there seems to be less\ndanger of tripping; and yet even this by reason it is a vain body and\nwithout any hold, is very apt to escape the memory, if it be not well\nassured.  Of which I had very pleasant experience, at the expense of such\nas profess only to form and accommodate their speech to the affair they\nhave in hand, or to humour of the great folks to whom they are speaking;\nfor the circumstances to which these men stick not to enslave their faith\nand conscience being subject to several changes, their language must vary\naccordingly: whence it happens that of the same thing they tell one man\nthat it is this, and another that it is that, giving it several colours;\nwhich men, if they once come to confer notes, and find out the cheat,\nwhat becomes of this fine art?  To which may be added, that they must of\nnecessity very often ridiculously trap themselves; for what memory can be\nsufficient to retain so many different shapes as they have forged upon\none and the same subject?  I have known many in my time very ambitious of\nthe repute of this fine wit; but they do not see that if they have the\nreputation of it, the effect can no longer be.\n\nIn plain truth, lying is an accursed vice.  We are not men, nor have\nother tie upon one another, but by our word.  If we did but discover the\nhorror and gravity of it, we should pursue it with fire and sword, and\nmore justly than other crimes.  I see that parents commonly, and with\nindiscretion enough, correct their children for little innocent faults,\nand torment them for wanton tricks, that have neither impression nor\nconsequence; whereas, in my opinion, lying only, and, which is of\nsomething a lower form, obstinacy, are the faults which are to be\nseverely whipped out of them, both in their infancy and in their\nprogress, otherwise they grow up and increase with them; and after a\ntongue has once got the knack of lying, \u2018tis not to be imagined how\nimpossible it is to reclaim it whence it comes to pass that we see some,\nwho are otherwise very honest men, so subject and enslaved to this vice.\nI have an honest lad to my tailor, whom I never knew guilty of one truth,\nno, not when it had been to his advantage.  If falsehood had, like truth,\nbut one face only, we should be upon better terms; for we should then\ntake for certain the contrary to what the liar says: but the reverse of\ntruth has a hundred thousand forms, and a field indefinite, without bound\nor limit.  The Pythagoreans make good to be certain and finite, and evil,\ninfinite and uncertain.  There are a thousand ways to miss the white,\nthere is only one to hit it.  For my own part, I have this vice in so\ngreat horror, that I am not sure I could prevail with my conscience to\nsecure myself from the most manifest and extreme danger by an impudent\nand solemn lie.  An ancient father says \u201cthat a dog we know is better\ncompany than a man whose language we do not understand.\u201d\n\n\n          \u201cUt externus alieno pene non sit hominis vice.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cAs a foreigner cannot be said to supply us the place of a man.\u201d\n      --Pliny, Nat. Hist. vii. I]\n\nAnd how much less sociable is false speaking than silence?\n\nKing Francis I. vaunted that he had by this means nonplussed Francesco\nTaverna, ambassador of Francesco Sforza, Duke of Milan, a man very famous\nfor his science in talking in those days.  This gentleman had been sent\nto excuse his master to his Majesty about a thing of very great\nconsequence, which was this: the King, still to maintain some\nintelligence with Italy, out of which he had lately been driven, and\nparticularly with the duchy of Milan, had thought it convenient to have a\ngentleman on his behalf to be with that Duke: an ambassador in effect,\nbut in outward appearance a private person who pretended to reside there\nupon his own particular affairs; for the Duke, much more depending upon\nthe Emperor, especially at a time when he was in a treaty of marriage\nwith his niece, daughter to the King of Denmark, who is now dowager of\nLorraine, could not manifest any practice and conference with us without\nhis great interest.  For this commission one Merveille, a Milanese\ngentleman, and an equerry to the King, being thought very fit, was\naccordingly despatched thither with private credentials, and instructions\nas ambassador, and with other letters of recommendation to the Duke about\nhis own private concerns, the better to mask and colour the business; and\nwas so long in that court, that the Emperor at last had some inkling of\nhis real employment there; which was the occasion of what followed after,\nas we suppose; which was, that under pretence of some murder, his trial\nwas in two days despatched, and his head in the night struck off in\nprison.  Messire Francesco being come, and prepared with a long\ncounterfeit history of the affair (for the King had applied himself to\nall the princes of Christendom, as well as to the Duke himself, to demand\nsatisfaction), had his audience at the morning council; where, after he\nhad for the support of his cause laid open several plausible\njustifications of the fact, that his master had never looked upon this\nMerveille for other than a private gentleman and his own subject, who was\nthere only in order to his own business, neither had he ever lived under\nany other aspect; absolutely disowning that he had ever heard he was one\nof the King\u2019s household or that his Majesty so much as knew him, so far\nwas he from taking him for an ambassador: the King, in his turn, pressing\nhim with several objections and demands, and challenging him on all\nsides, tripped him up at last by asking, why, then, the execution was\nperformed by night, and as it were by stealth?  At which the poor\nconfounded ambassador, the more handsomely to disengage himself, made\nanswer, that the Duke would have been very loth, out of respect to his\nMajesty, that such an execution should have been performed by day.  Any\none may guess if he was not well rated when he came home, for having so\ngrossly tripped in the presence of a prince of so delicate a nostril as\nKing Francis.\n\nPope Julius II. having sent an ambassador to the King of England to\nanimate him against King Francis, the ambassador having had his audience,\nand the King, before he would give an answer, insisting upon the\ndifficulties he should find in setting on foot so great a preparation as\nwould be necessary to attack so potent a King, and urging some reasons to\nthat effect, the ambassador very unseasonably replied that he had also\nhimself considered the same difficulties, and had represented them to the\nPope.  From which saying of his, so directly opposite to the thing\npropounded and the business he came about, which was immediately to\nincite him to war, the King of England first derived the argument (which\nhe afterward found to be true), that this ambassador, in his own mind,\nwas on the side of the French; of which having advertised his master, his\nestate at his return home was confiscated, and he himself very narrowly\nescaped the losing of his head.--[Erasmi Op. (1703), iv. col. 684.]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nOF QUICK OR SLOW SPEECH\n\n          \u201cOnc ne furent a touts toutes graces donnees.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cAll graces were never yet given to any one man.\u201d--A verse\n     in one of La Brebis\u2019 Sonnets.]\n\nSo we see in the gift of eloquence, wherein some have such a facility and\npromptness, and that which we call a present wit so easy, that they are\never ready upon all occasions, and never to be surprised; and others more\nheavy and slow, never venture to utter anything but what they have long\npremeditated, and taken great care and pains to fit and prepare.\n\nNow, as we teach young ladies those sports and exercises which are most\nproper to set out the grace and beauty of those parts wherein their\nchiefest ornament and perfection lie, so it should be in these two\nadvantages of eloquence, to which the lawyers and preachers of our age\nseem principally to pretend.  If I were worthy to advise, the slow\nspeaker, methinks, should be more proper for the pulpit, and the other\nfor the bar: and that because the employment of the first does naturally\nallow him all the leisure he can desire to prepare himself, and besides,\nhis career is performed in an even and unintermitted line, without stop\nor interruption; whereas the pleader\u2019s business and interest compels him\nto enter the lists upon all occasions, and the unexpected objections and\nreplies of his adverse party jostle him out of his course, and put him,\nupon the instant, to pump for new and extempore answers and defences.\nYet, at the interview betwixt Pope Clement and King Francis at\nMarseilles, it happened, quite contrary, that Monsieur Poyet, a man bred\nup all his life at the bar, and in the highest repute for eloquence,\nhaving the charge of making the harangue to the Pope committed to him,\nand having so long meditated on it beforehand, as, so they said, to have\nbrought it ready made along with him from Paris; the very day it was to\nhave been pronounced, the Pope, fearing something might be said that\nmight give offence to the other princes\u2019 ambassadors who were there\nattending on him, sent to acquaint the King with the argument which he\nconceived most suiting to the time and place, but, by chance, quite\nanother thing to that Monsieur de Poyet had taken so much pains about: so\nthat the fine speech he had prepared was of no use, and he was upon the\ninstant to contrive another; which finding himself unable to do, Cardinal\ndu Bellay was constrained to perform that office.  The pleader\u2019s part is,\ndoubtless, much harder than that of the preacher; and yet, in my opinion,\nwe see more passable lawyers than preachers, at all events in France.\nIt should seem that the nature of wit is to have its operation prompt and\nsudden, and that of judgment to have it more deliberate and more slow.\nBut he who remains totally silent, for want of leisure to prepare himself\nto speak well, and he also whom leisure does noways benefit to better\nspeaking, are equally unhappy.\n\n\u2018Tis said of Severus Cassius that he spoke best extempore, that he stood\nmore obliged to fortune than to his own diligence; that it was an\nadvantage to him to be interrupted in speaking, and that his adversaries\nwere afraid to nettle him, lest his anger should redouble his eloquence.\nI know, experimentally, the disposition of nature so impatient of tedious\nand elaborate premeditation, that if it do not go frankly and gaily to\nwork, it can perform nothing to purpose.  We say of some compositions\nthat they stink of oil and of the lamp, by reason of a certain rough\nharshness that laborious handling imprints upon those where it has been\nemployed.  But besides this, the solicitude of doing well, and a certain\nstriving and contending of a mind too far strained and overbent upon its\nundertaking, breaks and hinders itself like water, that by force of its\nown pressing violence and abundance, cannot find a ready issue through\nthe neck of a bottle or a narrow sluice.  In this condition of nature,\nof which I am now speaking, there is this also, that it would not be\ndisordered and stimulated with such passions as the fury of Cassius (for\nsuch a motion would be too violent and rude); it would not be jostled,\nbut solicited; it would be roused and heated by unexpected, sudden, and\naccidental occasions.  If it be left to itself, it flags and languishes;\nagitation only gives it grace and vigour.  I am always worst in my own\npossession, and when wholly at my own disposition: accident has more\ntitle to anything that comes from me than I; occasion, company, and even\nthe very rising and falling of my own voice, extract more from my fancy\nthan I can find, when I sound and employ it by myself.  By which means,\nthe things I say are better than those I write, if either were to be\npreferred, where neither is worth anything.  This, also, befalls me, that\nI do not find myself where I seek myself, and I light upon things more by\nchance than by any inquisition of my own judgment.  I perhaps sometimes\nhit upon something when I write, that seems quaint and sprightly to me,\nthough it will appear dull and heavy to another.--But let us leave these\nfine compliments; every one talks thus of himself according to his\ntalent.  But when I come to speak, I am already so lost that I know not\nwhat I was about to say, and in such cases a stranger often finds it out\nbefore me.  If I should make erasure so often as this inconvenience\nbefalls me, I should make clean work; occasion will, at some other time,\nlay it as visible to me as the light, and make me wonder what I should\nstick at.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nOF PROGNOSTICATIONS\n\nFor what concerns oracles, it is certain that a good while before the\ncoming of Jesus Christ they had begun to lose their credit; for we see\nthat Cicero troubled to find out the cause of their decay, and he has\nthese words:\n\n          \u201cCur isto modo jam oracula Delphis non eduntur,\n          non modo nostro aetate, sed jam diu; ut nihil\n          possit esse contemptius?\u201d\n\n     [\u201cWhat is the reason that the oracles at Delphi are no longer\n     uttered: not merely in this age of ours, but for a long time past,\n     insomuch that nothing is more in contempt?\u201d\n      --Cicero, De Divin., ii. 57.]\n\nBut as to the other prognostics, calculated from the anatomy of beasts at\nsacrifices (to which purpose Plato does, in part, attribute the natural\nconstitution of the intestines of the beasts themselves), the\nscraping of poultry, the flight of birds--\n\n          \u201cAves quasdam .  .  .  rerum augurandarum\n          causa natas esse putamus.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cWe think some sorts of birds are purposely created to serve\n     the purposes of augury.\u201d--Cicero, De Natura Deor., ii. 64.]\n\nclaps of thunder, the overflowing of rivers--\n\n          \u201cMulta cernunt Aruspices, multa Augures provident,\n          multa oraculis declarantur, multa vaticinationibus,\n          multa somniis, multa portentis.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThe Aruspices discern many things, the Augurs foresee many things,\n     many things are announced by oracles, many by vaticinations, many by\n     dreams, many by portents.\u201d--Cicero, De Natura Deor., ii. 65.]\n\n--and others of the like nature, upon which antiquity founded most of\ntheir public and private enterprises, our religion has totally abolished\nthem.  And although there yet remain amongst us some practices of\ndivination from the stars, from spirits, from the shapes and complexions\nof men, from dreams and the like (a notable example of the wild curiosity\nof our nature to grasp at and anticipate future things, as if we had not\nenough to do to digest the present)--\n\n               \u201cCur hanc tibi, rector Olympi,\n               Sollicitis visum mortalibus addere curam,\n               Noscant venturas ut dira per omina clades?...\n               Sit subitum, quodcumque paras; sit coeca futuri\n               Mens hominum fati, liceat sperare timenti.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cWhy, ruler of Olympus, hast thou to anxious mortals thought fit to\n     add this care, that they should know by, omens future slaughter?...\n     Let whatever thou art preparing be sudden.  Let the mind of men be\n     blind to fate in store; let it be permitted to the timid to hope.\u201d\n      --Lucan, ii. 14]\n\n               \u201cNe utile quidem est scire quid futurum sit;\n               miserum est enim, nihil proficientem angi,\u201d\n\n     [\u201cIt is useless to know what shall come to pass; it is a miserable\n     thing to be tormented to no purpose.\u201d\n      --Cicero, De Natura Deor., iii. 6.]\n\nyet are they of much less authority now than heretofore.  Which makes so\nmuch more remarkable the example of Francesco, Marquis of Saluzzo, who\nbeing lieutenant to King Francis I. in his ultramontane army, infinitely\nfavoured and esteemed in our court, and obliged to the king\u2019s bounty for\nthe marquisate itself, which had been forfeited by his brother; and as to\nthe rest, having no manner of provocation given him to do it, and even\nhis own affection opposing any such disloyalty, suffered himself to be so\nterrified, as it was confidently reported, with the fine prognostics that\nwere spread abroad everywhere in favour of the Emperor Charles V., and to\nour disadvantage (especially in Italy, where these foolish prophecies\nwere so far believed, that at Rome great sums of money were ventured out\nupon return of greater, when the prognostics came to pass, so certain\nthey made themselves of our ruin), that, having often bewailed, to those\nof his acquaintance who were most intimate with him, the mischiefs that\nhe saw would inevitably fall upon the Crown of France and the friends he\nhad in that court, he revolted and turned to the other side; to his own\nmisfortune, nevertheless, what constellation soever governed at that\ntime.  But he carried himself in this affair like a man agitated by\ndivers passions; for having both towns and forces in his hands, the\nenemy\u2019s army under Antonio de Leyva close by him, and we not at all\nsuspecting his design, it had been in his power to have done more than he\ndid; for we lost no men by this infidelity of his, nor any town, but\nFossano only, and that after a long siege and a brave defence.--[1536]\n\n                   \u201cPrudens futuri temporis exitum\n                    Caliginosa nocte premit Deus,\n                    Ridetque, si mortalis ultra\n                    Fas trepidat.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cA wise God covers with thick night the path of the future, and\n     laughs at the man who alarms himself without reason.\u201d\n      --Hor., Od., iii. 29.]\n\n                    \u201cIlle potens sui\n                    Laetusque deget, cui licet in diem\n                    Dixisse vixi!  cras vel atra\n                    Nube polum pater occupato,\n                    Vel sole puro.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cHe lives happy and master of himself who can say as each day\n     passes on, \u2018I HAVE LIVED:\u2019 whether to-morrow our Father shall give\n     us a clouded sky or a clear day.\u201d--Hor., Od., iii. 29]\n\n                    \u201cLaetus in praesens animus; quod ultra est,\n                    Oderit curare.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cA mind happy, cheerful in the present state, will take good care\n     not to think of what is beyond it.\u201d--Ibid., ii. 25]\n\nAnd those who take this sentence in a contrary sense interpret it amiss:\n\n               \u201cIsta sic reciprocantur, ut et si divinatio sit,\n               dii sint; et si dii lint, sit divinatio.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThese things are so far reciprocal that if there be divination,\n     there must be deities; and if deities, divination.\u201d--Cicero, De\n     Divin., i. 6.]\n\nMuch more wisely Pacuvius--\n\n         \u201cNam istis, qui linguam avium intelligunt,\n          Plusque ex alieno jecore sapiunt, quam ex suo,\n          Magis audiendum, quam auscultandum, censeo.\u201d\n\n\n     [\u201cAs to those who understand the language of birds, and who rather\n     consult the livers of animals other than their own, I had rather\n     hear them than attend to them.\u201d\n      --Cicero, De Divin., i. 57, ex Pacuvio]\n\nThe so celebrated art of divination amongst the Tuscans took its\nbeginning thus: A labourer striking deep with his cutter into the earth,\nsaw the demigod Tages ascend, with an infantine aspect, but endued with a\nmature and senile wisdom.  Upon the rumour of which, all the people ran\nto see the sight, by whom his words and science, containing the\nprinciples and means to attain to this art, were recorded, and kept for\nmany ages.--[Cicero, De Devina, ii. 23]--A birth suitable to its\nprogress; I, for my part, should sooner regulate my affairs by the chance\nof a die than by such idle and vain dreams.  And, indeed, in all\nrepublics, a good share of the government has ever been referred to\nchance.  Plato, in the civil regimen that he models according to his own\nfancy, leaves to it the decision of several things of very great\nimportance, and will, amongst other things, that marriages should be\nappointed by lot; attributing so great importance to this accidental\nchoice as to ordain that the children begotten in such wedlock be brought\nup in the country, and those begotten in any other be thrust out as\nspurious and base; yet so, that if any of those exiles, notwithstanding,\nshould, peradventure, in growing up give any good hope of himself, he\nmight be recalled, as, also, that such as had been retained, should be\nexiled, in case they gave little expectation of themselves in their early\ngrowth.\n\nI see some who are mightily given to study and comment upon their\nalmanacs, and produce them to us as an authority when anything has fallen\nout pat; and, for that matter, it is hardly possible but that these\nalleged authorities sometimes stumble upon a truth amongst an infinite\nnumber of lies.\n\n          \u201cQuis est enim, qui totum diem jaculans\n          non aliquando collineet?\u201d\n\n     [\u201cFor who shoots all day at butts that does not sometimes hit the\n     white?\u201d--Cicero, De Divin., ii. 59.]\n\nI think never the better of them for some such accidental hit.  There\nwould be more certainty in it if there were a rule and a truth of always\nlying.  Besides, nobody records their flimflams and false prognostics,\nforasmuch as they are infinite and common; but if they chop upon one\ntruth, that carries a mighty report, as being rare, incredible, and\nprodigious.  So Diogenes, surnamed the Atheist, answered him in\nSamothrace, who, showing him in the temple the several offerings and\nstories in painting of those who had escaped shipwreck, said to him,\n\u201cLook, you who think the gods have no care of human things, what do you\nsay to so many persons preserved from death by their especial favour?\u201d\n \u201cWhy, I say,\u201d answered he, \u201cthat their pictures are not here who were\ncast away, who are by much the greater number.\u201d--[Cicero, De Natura\nDeor., i.  37.]\n\nCicero observes that of all the philosophers who have acknowledged a\ndeity, Xenophanes the Colophonian only has endeavoured to eradicate all\nmanner of divination--[Cicero, De Divin., i. 3.]--; which makes it the\nless a wonder if we have now and then seen some of our princes, sometimes\nto their own cost, rely too much upon these vanities.  I had given\nanything with my own eyes to see those two great marvels, the book of\nJoachim the Calabrian abbot, which foretold all the future Popes, their\nnames and qualities; and that of the Emperor Leo, which prophesied all\nthe emperors and patriarchs of Greece.  This I have been an eyewitness\nof, that in public confusions, men astonished at their fortune, have\nabandoned their own reason, superstitiously to seek out in the stars the\nancient causes and menaces of the present mishaps, and in my time have\nbeen so strangely successful in it, as to make me believe that this being\nan amusement of sharp and volatile wits, those who have been versed in\nthis knack of unfolding and untying riddles, are capable, in any sort of\nwriting, to find out what they desire.  But above all, that which gives\nthem the greatest room to play in, is the obscure, ambiguous, and\nfantastic gibberish of the prophetic canting, where their authors deliver\nnothing of clear sense, but shroud all in riddle, to the end that\nposterity may interpret and apply it according to its own fancy.\n\nSocrates demon might, perhaps, be no other but a certain impulsion of the\nwill, which obtruded itself upon him without the advice or consent of his\njudgment; and in a soul so enlightened as his was, and so prepared by a\ncontinual exercise of wisdom-and virtue, \u2018tis to be supposed those\ninclinations of his, though sudden and undigested, were very important\nand worthy to be followed.  Every one finds in himself some image of such\nagitations, of a prompt, vehement, and fortuitous opinion; and I may well\nallow them some authority, who attribute so little to our prudence, and\nwho also myself have had some, weak in reason, but violent in persuasion\nand dissuasion, which were most frequent with Socrates,--[Plato, in his\naccount of Theages the Pythagorean]--by which I have suffered myself to\nbe carried away so fortunately, and so much to my own advantage, that\nthey might have been judged to have had something in them of a divine\ninspiration.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nOF CONSTANCY\n\nThe law of resolution and constancy does not imply that we ought not, as\nmuch as in us lies, to decline and secure ourselves from the mischiefs\nand inconveniences that threaten us; nor, consequently, that we shall not\nfear lest they should surprise us: on the contrary, all decent and honest\nways and means of securing ourselves from harms, are not only permitted,\nbut, moreover, commendable, and the business of constancy chiefly is,\nbravely to stand to, and stoutly to suffer those inconveniences which are\nnot possibly to be avoided.  So that there is no supple motion of body,\nnor any movement in the handling of arms, how irregular or ungraceful\nsoever, that we need condemn, if they serve to protect us from the blow\nthat is made against us.\n\nSeveral very warlike nations have made use of a retreating and flying way\nof fight as a thing of singular advantage, and, by so doing, have made\ntheir backs more dangerous to their enemies than their faces.  Of which\nkind of fighting the Turks still retain something in their practice of\narms; and Socrates, in Plato, laughs at Laches, who had defined fortitude\nto be a standing firm in the ranks against the enemy.  \u201cWhat!\u201d says he,\n\u201cwould it, then, be a reputed cowardice to overcome them by giving\nground?\u201d urging, at the same time, the authority of Homer, who commends\nin AEneas the science of flight.  And whereas Laches, considering better\nof it, admits the practice as to the Scythians, and, in general, all\ncavalry whatever, he again attacks him with the example of the\nLacedaemonian foot--a nation of all other the most obstinate in\nmaintaining their ground--who, in the battle of Plataea, not being able\nto break into the Persian phalanx, bethought themselves to disperse and\nretire, that by the enemy supposing they fled, they might break and\ndisunite that vast body of men in the pursuit, and by that stratagem\nobtained the victory.\n\nAs for the Scythians, \u2018tis said of them, that when Darius went his\nexpedition to subdue them, he sent, by a herald, highly to reproach their\nking, that he always retired before him and declined a battle; to which\nIdanthyrses,--[Herod., iv.  127.]--for that was his name, returned\nanswer, that it was not for fear of him, or of any man living, that he\ndid so, but that it was the way of marching in practice with his nation,\nwho had neither tilled fields, cities, nor houses to defend, or to fear\nthe enemy should make any advantage of but that if he had such a stomach\nto fight, let him but come to view their ancient places of sepulture, and\nthere he should have his fill.\n\nNevertheless, as to cannon-shot, when a body of men are drawn up in the\nface of a train of artillery, as the occasion of war often requires, it\nis unhandsome to quit their post to avoid the danger, forasmuch as by\nreason of its violence and swiftness we account it inevitable; and many a\none, by ducking, stepping aside, and such other motions of fear, has\nbeen, at all events, sufficiently laughed at by his companions.  And yet,\nin the expedition that the Emperor Charles V. made against us into\nProvence, the Marquis de Guast going to reconnoitre the city of Arles,\nand advancing out of the cover of a windmill, under favour of which he\nhad made his approach, was perceived by the Seigneurs de Bonneval and the\nSeneschal of Agenois, who were walking upon the \u2018theatre aux ayenes\u2019; who\nhaving shown him to the Sieur de Villiers, commissary of the artillery,\nhe pointed a culverin so admirably well, and levelled it so exactly right\nagainst him, that had not the Marquis, seeing fire given to it, slipped\naside, it was certainly concluded the shot had taken him full in the\nbody.  And, in like manner, some years before, Lorenzo de\u2019 Medici, Duke\nof Urbino, and father to the queen-mother--[Catherine de\u2019 Medici, mother\nof Henry III.]--laying siege to Mondolfo, a place in the territories of\nthe Vicariat in Italy, seeing the cannoneer give fire to a piece that\npointed directly against him, it was well for him that he ducked, for\notherwise the shot, that only razed the top of his head, had doubtless\nhit him full in the breast.  To say truth, I do not think that these\nevasions are performed upon the account of judgment; for how can any man\nliving judge of high or low aim on so sudden an occasion?  And it is much\nmore easy to believe that fortune favoured their apprehension, and that\nit might be as well at another time to make them face the danger, as to\nseek to avoid it.  For my own part, I confess I cannot forbear starting\nwhen the rattle of a harquebuse thunders in my ears on a sudden, and in a\nplace where I am not to expect it, which I have also observed in others,\nbraver fellows than I.\n\nNeither do the Stoics pretend that the soul of their philosopher need be\nproof against the first visions and fantasies that surprise him; but, as\nto a natural subjection, consent that he should tremble at the terrible\nnoise of thunder, or the sudden clatter of some falling ruin, and be\naffrighted even to paleness and convulsion; and so in other passions,\nprovided his judgment remain sound and entire, and that the seat of his\nreason suffer no concussion nor alteration, and that he yield no consent\nto his fright and discomposure.  To him who is not a philosopher, a\nfright is the same thing in the first part of it, but quite another thing\nin the second; for the impression of passions does not remain\nsuperficially in him, but penetrates farther, even to the very seat of\nreason, infecting and corrupting it, so that he judges according to his\nfear, and conforms his behaviour to it. In this verse you may see the\ntrue state of the wise Stoic learnedly and plainly expressed:--\n\n          \u201cMens immota manet; lachrymae volvuntur inanes.\u201d\n\n          [\u201cThough tears flow, the mind remains unmoved.\u201d\n           --Virgil, AEneid, iv. 449]\n\nThe Peripatetic sage does not exempt himself totally from perturbations\nof mind, but he moderates them.\n\n\n\n\n     ETEXT EDITOR\u2019S BOOKMARKS:\n\n     Almanacs\n     Being dead they were then by one day happier than he\n     Books I read over again, still smile upon me with  fresh novelty\n     Death discharges us of all our obligations\n     Difference betwixt memory and understanding\n     Do thine own work, and know thyself\n     Effect and performance are not at all in our power\n     Fantastic gibberish of the prophetic canting\n     Folly of gaping after future things\n     Good to be certain and finite, and evil, infinite and uncertain\n     He who lives everywhere, lives nowhere\n     If they chop upon one truth, that carries a mighty report\n     Impotencies that so unseasonably surprise the lover\n     Let it be permitted to the timid to hope\n     Light griefs can speak: deep sorrows are dumb\n     Look, you who think the gods have no care of human things\n     Nature of judgment to have it more deliberate and more slow\n     Nature of wit is to have its operation prompt and sudden\n     Nor have other tie upon one another, but by our word\n     Old men who retain the memory of things past\n     Pity is reputed a vice amongst the Stoics\n     Rather complain of ill-fortune than be ashamed of victory\n     Reverse of truth has a hundred thousand forms\n     Say of some compositions that they stink of oil and of the lamp\n     Solon, that none can be said to be happy until he is dead\n     Strong memory is commonly coupled with infirm judgment\n     Stumble upon a truth amongst an infinite number of lies\n     Suffer those inconveniences which are not possibly to be avoided\n     Superstitiously to seek out in the stars the ancient causes\n     Their pictures are not here who were cast away\n     Things I say are better than those I write\n     We are masters of nothing but the will\n     We cannot be bound beyond what we are able to perform\n     Where the lion\u2019s skin is too short\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nESSAYS OF MICHEL DE MONTAIGNE\n\nTranslated by Charles Cotton\n\nEdited by William Carew Hazlitt\n\n1877\n\n\n\nCONTENTS OF VOLUME 3.\n\nXIII.

According to our common rule of civility, it would be a\nnotable affront to an equal, and much more to a superior, to fail being\nat home when he has given you notice he will come to visit you.  Nay,\nQueen Margaret of Navarre--[Marguerite de Valois, authoress of the\n\u2018Heptameron\u2019]--further adds, that it would be a rudeness in a gentleman\nto go out, as we so often do, to meet any that is coming to see him, let\nhim be of what high condition soever; and that it is more respectful and\nmore civil to stay at home to receive him, if only upon the account of\nmissing him by the way, and that it is enough to receive him at the door,\nand to wait upon him.  For my part, who as much as I can endeavour to\nreduce the ceremonies of my house, I very often forget both the one and\nthe other of these vain offices.  If, peradventure, some one may take\noffence at this, I can\u2019t help it; it is much better to offend him once\nthan myself every day, for it would be a perpetual slavery.  To what end\ndo we avoid the servile attendance of courts, if we bring the same\ntrouble home to our own private houses?  It is also a common rule in all\nassemblies, that those of less quality are to be first upon the place, by\nreason that it is more due to the better sort to make others wait and\nexpect them.\n\nNevertheless, at the interview betwixt Pope Clement and King Francis at\nMarseilles,--[in 1533.]--the King, after he had taken order for the\nnecessary preparations for his reception and entertainment, withdrew out\nof the town, and gave the Pope two or three days\u2019 respite for his entry,\nand to repose and refresh himself, before he came to him.  And in like\nmanner, at the assignation of the Pope and the Emperor,--[Charles V.  in\n1532.] at Bologna, the Emperor gave the Pope opportunity to come thither\nfirst, and came himself after; for which the reason given was this, that\nat all the interviews of such princes, the greater ought to be first at\nthe appointed place, especially before the other in whose territories the\ninterview is appointed to be, intimating thereby a kind of deference to\nthe other, it appearing proper for the less to seek out and to apply\nthemselves to the greater, and not the greater to them.\n\nNot every country only, but every city and every society has its\nparticular forms of civility.  There was care enough to this taken in my\neducation, and I have lived in good company enough to know the\nformalities of our own nation, and am able to give lessons in it.  I love\nto follow them, but not to be so servilely tied to their observation that\nmy whole life should be enslaved to ceremonies, of which there are some\nso troublesome that, provided a man omits them out of discretion, and not\nfor want of breeding, it will be every whit as handsome.  I have seen\nsome people rude, by being overcivil and troublesome in their courtesy.\n\nStill, these excesses excepted, the knowledge of courtesy and good\nmanners is a very necessary study.  It is, like grace and beauty, that\nwhich begets liking and an inclination to love one another at the first\nsight, and in the very beginning of acquaintance; and, consequently, that\nwhich first opens the door and intromits us to instruct ourselves by the\nexample of others, and to give examples ourselves, if we have any worth\ntaking notice of and communicating.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nTHAT MEN ARE JUSTLY PUNISHED FOR BEING OBSTINATE IN THE DEFENCE\nOF A FORT THAT IS NOT IN REASON TO BE DEFENDED\n\nValour has its bounds as well as other virtues, which, once transgressed,\nthe next step is into the territories of vice; so that by having too\nlarge a proportion of this heroic virtue, unless a man be very perfect in\nits limits, which upon the confines are very hard to discern, he may very\neasily unawares run into temerity, obstinacy, and folly.  From this\nconsideration it is that we have derived the custom, in times of war, to\npunish, even with death, those who are obstinate to defend a place that\nby the rules of war is not tenable; otherwise men would be so confident\nupon the hope of impunity, that not a henroost but would resist and seek\nto stop an army.\n\nThe Constable Monsieur de Montmorenci, having at the siege of Pavia been\nordered to pass the Ticino, and to take up his quarters in the Faubourg\nSt. Antonio, being hindered by a tower at the end of the bridge, which\nwas so obstinate as to endure a battery, hanged every man he found within\nit for their labour.  And again, accompanying the Dauphin in his\nexpedition beyond the Alps, and taking the Castle of Villano by assault,\nand all within it being put to the sword by the fury of the soldiers, the\ngovernor and his ensign only excepted, he caused them both to be trussed\nup for the same reason; as also did the Captain Martin du Bellay, then\ngovernor of Turin, with the governor of San Buono, in the same country,\nall his people having been cut to pieces at the taking of the place.\n\nBut forasmuch as the strength or weakness of a fortress is always\nmeasured by the estimate and counterpoise of the forces that attack it\n--for a man might reasonably enough despise two culverins, that would be\na madman to abide a battery of thirty pieces of cannon--where also the\ngreatness of the prince who is master of the field, his reputation, and\nthe respect that is due unto him, are also put into the balance, there is\ndanger that the balance be pressed too much in that direction.  And it\nmay happen that a man is possessed with so great an opinion of himself\nand his power, that thinking it unreasonable any place should dare to\nshut its gates against him, he puts all to the sword where he meets with\nany opposition, whilst his fortune continues; as is plain in the fierce\nand arrogant forms of summoning towns and denouncing war, savouring so\nmuch of barbarian pride and insolence, in use amongst the Oriental\nprinces, and which their successors to this day do yet retain and\npractise.  And in that part of the world where the Portuguese subdued the\nIndians, they found some states where it was a universal and inviolable\nlaw amongst them that every enemy overcome by the king in person, or by\nhis lieutenant, was out of composition.\n\nSo above all both of ransom and mercy a man should take heed, if he can,\nof falling into the hands of a judge who is an enemy and victorious.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nOF THE PUNISHMENT OF COWARDICE\n\nI once heard of a prince, and a great captain, having a narration given\nhim as he sat at table of the proceeding against Monsieur de Vervins, who\nwas sentenced to death for having surrendered Boulogne to the English,\n--[To Henry VIII. in 1544]--openly maintaining that a soldier could not\njustly be put to death for want of courage.  And, in truth, \u2018tis reason\nthat a man should make a great difference betwixt faults that merely\nproceed from infirmity, and those that are visibly the effects of\ntreachery and malice: for, in the last, we act against the rules of\nreason that nature has imprinted in us; whereas, in the former, it seems\nas if we might produce the same nature, who left us in such a state of\nimperfection and weakness of courage, for our justification.  Insomuch\nthat many have thought we are not fairly questionable for anything but\nwhat we commit against our conscience; and it is partly upon this rule\nthat those ground their opinion who disapprove of capital or sanguinary\npunishments inflicted upon heretics and misbelievers; and theirs also who\nadvocate or a judge is not accountable for having from mere ignorance\nfailed in his administration.\n\nBut as to cowardice, it is certain that the most usual way of chastising\nit is by ignominy and and it is supposed that this practice brought into\nuse by the legislator Charondas; and that, before his time, the laws of\nGreece punished those with death who fled from a battle; whereas he\nordained only that they be for three days exposed in the public dressed\nin woman\u2019s attire, hoping yet for some service from them, having awakened\ntheir courage by this open shame:\n\n          \u201cSuffundere malis homims sanguinem, quam effundere.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cRather bring the blood into a man\u2019s cheek than let it out of his\n     body.\u201d  Tertullian in his Apologetics.]\n\nIt appears also that the Roman laws did anciently punish those with death\nwho had run away; for Ammianus Marcellinus says that the Emperor Julian\ncommanded ten of his soldiers, who had turned their backs in an encounter\nagainst the Parthians, to be first degraded, and afterward put to death,\naccording, says he, to the ancient laws,--[Ammianus Marcellinus, xxiv.\n4; xxv. i.]--and yet elsewhere for the like offence he only condemned\nothers to remain amongst the prisoners under the baggage ensign.  The\nsevere punishment the people of Rome inflicted upon those who fled from\nthe battle of Cannae, and those who ran away with Aeneius Fulvius at his\ndefeat, did not extend to death.  And yet, methinks, \u2018tis to be feared,\nlest disgrace should make such delinquents desperate, and not only faint\nfriends, but enemies.\n\nOf late memory,--[In 1523]--the Seigneur de Frauget, lieutenant to the\nMareschal de Chatillon\u2019s company, having by the Mareschal de Chabannes\nbeen put in government of Fuentarabia in the place of Monsieur de Lude,\nand having surrendered it to the Spaniard, he was for that condemned to\nbe degraded from all nobility, and both himself and his posterity\ndeclared ignoble, taxable, and for ever incapable of bearing arms, which\nsevere sentence was afterwards accordingly executed at Lyons.--[In 1536]\n--And, since that, all the gentlemen who were in Guise when the Count of\nNassau entered into it, underwent the same punishment, as several others\nhave done since for the like offence.  Notwithstanding, in case of such a\nmanifest ignorance or cowardice as exceeds all ordinary example, \u2018tis but\nreason to take it for a sufficient proof of treachery and malice, and for\nsuch to be punished.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nA PROCEEDING OF SOME AMBASSADORS\n\nI observe in my travels this custom, ever to learn something from the\ninformation of those with whom I confer (which is the best school of all\nothers), and to put my company upon those subjects they are the best able\nto speak of:--\n\n               \u201cBasti al nocchiero ragionar de\u2019 venti,\n               Al bifolco dei tori; et le sue piaghe\n               Conti\u2019l guerrier; conti\u2019l pastor gli armenti.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cLet the sailor content himself with talking of the winds; the\n     cowherd of his oxen; the soldier of his wounds; the shepherd of his\n     flocks.\u201d--An Italian translation of Propertius, ii. i, 43]\n\nFor it often falls out that, on the contrary, every one will rather\nchoose to be prating of another man\u2019s province than his own, thinking it\nso much new reputation acquired; witness the jeer Archidamus put upon\nPertander, \u201cthat he had quitted the glory of being an excellent physician\nto gain the repute of a very bad poet.--[Plutarch, Apoth. of the\nLacedaemonians, \u2018in voce\u2019 Archidamus.]--And do but observe how large and\nample Caesar is to make us understand his inventions of building bridges\nand contriving engines of war,--[De Bello Gall., iv. 17.]--and how\nsuccinct and reserved in comparison, where he speaks of the offices of\nhis profession, his own valour, and military conduct.  His exploits\nsufficiently prove him a great captain, and that he knew well enough; but\nhe would be thought an excellent engineer to boot; a quality something\ndifferent, and not necessary to be expected in him.  The elder Dionysius\nwas a very great captain, as it befitted his fortune he should be; but he\ntook very great pains to get a particular reputation by poetry, and yet\nhe was never cut out for a poet.  A man of the legal profession being not\nlong since brought to see a study furnished with all sorts of books, both\nof his own and all other faculties, took no occasion at all to entertain\nhimself with any of them, but fell very rudely and magisterially to\ndescant upon a barricade placed on the winding stair before the study\ndoor, a thing that a hundred captains and common soldiers see every day\nwithout taking any notice or offence.\n\n          \u201cOptat ephippia bos piger, optat arare caballus.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThe lazy ox desires a saddle and bridle; the horse wants to\n     plough.\u201d--Hor., Ep., i. 14,43.]\n\nBy this course a man shall never improve himself, nor arrive at any\nperfection in anything.  He must, therefore, make it his business always\nto put the architect, the painter, the statuary, every mechanic artisan,\nupon discourse of their own capacities.\n\nAnd, to this purpose, in reading histories, which is everybody\u2019s subject,\nI use to consider what kind of men are the authors: if they be persons\nthat profess nothing but mere letters, I, in and from them, principally\nobserve and learn style and language; if physicians, I the rather incline\nto credit what they report of the temperature of the air, of the health\nand complexions of princes, of wounds and diseases; if lawyers, we are\nfrom them to take notice of the controversies of rights and wrongs, the\nestablishment of laws and civil government, and the like; if divines, the\naffairs of the Church, ecclesiastical censures, marriages, and\ndispensations; if courtiers, manners and ceremonies; if soldiers, the\nthings that properly belong to their trade, and, principally, the\naccounts of the actions and enterprises wherein they were personally\nengaged; if ambassadors, we are to observe negotiations, intelligences,\nand practices, and the manner how they are to be carried on.\n\nAnd this is the reason why (which perhaps I should have lightly passed\nover in another) I dwelt upon and maturely considered one passage in the\nhistory written by Monsieur de Langey, a man of very great judgment in\nthings of that nature: after having given a narrative of the fine oration\nCharles V. had made in the Consistory at Rome, and in the presence of the\nBishop of Macon and Monsieur du Velly, our ambassadors there, wherein he\nhad mixed several injurious expressions to the dishonour of our nation;\nand amongst the rest, \u201cthat if his captains and soldiers were not men of\nanother kind of fidelity, resolution, and sufficiency in the knowledge of\narms than those of the King, he would immediately go with a rope about\nhis neck and sue to him for mercy\u201d (and it should seem the Emperor had\nreally this, or a very little better opinion of our military men, for he\nafterwards, twice or thrice in his life, said the very same thing); as\nalso, that he challenged the King to fight him in his shirt with rapier\nand poignard in a boat.  The said Sieur de Langey, pursuing his history,\nadds that the forenamed ambassadors, sending a despatch to the King of\nthese things, concealed the greatest part, and particularly the last two\npassages.  At which I could not but wonder that it should be in the power\nof an ambassador to dispense with anything which he ought to signify to\nhis master, especially of so great importance as this, coming from the\nmouth of such a person, and spoken in so great an assembly; and I should\nrather conceive it had been the servant\u2019s duty faithfully to have\nrepresented to him the whole thing as it passed, to the end that the\nliberty of selecting, disposing, judging, and concluding might have\nremained in him: for either to conceal or to disguise the truth for fear\nhe should take it otherwise than he ought to do, and lest it should\nprompt him to some extravagant resolution, and, in the meantime, to leave\nhim ignorant of his affairs, should seem, methinks, rather to belong to\nhim who is to give the law than to him who is only to receive it; to him\nwho is in supreme command, and not to him who ought to look upon himself\nas inferior, not only in authority, but also in prudence and good\ncounsel.  I, for my part, would not be so served in my little concerns.\n\nWe so willingly slip the collar of command upon any pretence whatever,\nand are so ready to usurp upon dominion, every one does so naturally\naspire to liberty and power, that no utility whatever derived from the\nwit or valour of those he employs ought to be so dear to a superior as a\ndownright and sincere obedience.  To obey more upon the account of\nunderstanding than of subjection, is to corrupt the office of command\n--[Taken from Aulus Gellius, i. 13.]--; insomuch that P. Crassus, the same\nwhom the Romans reputed five times happy, at the time when he was consul\nin Asia, having sent to a Greek engineer to cause the greater of two\nmasts of ships that he had taken notice of at Athens to be brought to\nhim, to be employed about some engine of battery he had a design to make;\nthe other, presuming upon his own science and sufficiency in those\naffairs, thought fit to do otherwise than directed, and to bring the\nless, which, according to the rules of art, was really more proper for\nthe use to which it was designed; but Crassus, though he gave ear to his\nreasons with great patience, would not, however, take them, how sound or\nconvincing soever, for current pay, but caused him to be well whipped for\nhis pains, valuing the interest of discipline much more than that of the\nwork in hand.\n\nNotwithstanding, we may on the other side consider that so precise and\nimplicit an obedience as this is only due to positive and limited\ncommands.  The employment of ambassadors is never so confined, many\nthings in their management of affairs being wholly referred to the\nabsolute sovereignty of their own conduct; they do not simply execute,\nbut also, to their own discretion and wisdom, form and model their\nmaster\u2019s pleasure.  I have, in my time, known men of command checked for\nhaving rather obeyed the express words of the king\u2019s letters, than the\nnecessity of the affairs they had in hand.  Men of understanding do yet,\nto this day, condemn the custom of the kings of Persia to give their\nlieutenants and agents so little rein, that, upon the least arising\ndifficulties, they must fain have recourse to their further commands;\nthis delay, in so vast an extent of dominion, having often very much\nprejudiced their affairs; and Crassus, writing to a man whose profession\nit was best to understand those things, and pre-acquainting him to what\nuse this mast was designed, did he not seem to consult his advice, and in\na manner invite him to interpose his better judgment?\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nOF FEAR\n\n          \u201cObstupui, steteruntque comae et vox faucibus haesit.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cI was amazed, my hair stood on end, and my voice stuck in my\n     throat.\u201d  Virgil, AEneid, ii.  774.]\n\nI am not so good a naturalist (as they call it) as to discern by what\nsecret springs fear has its motion in us; but, be this as it may, \u2018tis a\nstrange passion, and such a one that the physicians say there is no other\nwhatever that sooner dethrones our judgment from its proper seat; which\nis so true, that I myself have seen very many become frantic through\nfear; and, even in those of the best settled temper it is most certain\nthat it begets a terrible astonishment and confusion during the fit.\nI omit the vulgar sort, to whom it one while represents their\ngreat-grandsires risen out of their graves in their shrouds, another while\nwerewolves, nightmares, and chimaeras; but even amongst soldiers, a sort\nof men over whom, of all others, it ought to have the least power, how\noften has it converted flocks of sheep into armed squadrons, reeds and\nbullrushes into pikes and lances, friends into enemies, and the French\nwhite cross into the red cross of Spain!  When Monsieur de Bourbon took\nRome,--[In 1527]--an ensign who was upon guard at Borgo San Pietro was\nseized with such a fright upon the first alarm, that he threw himself out\nat a breach with his colours upon his shoulder, and ran directly upon the\nenemy, thinking he had retreated toward the inward defences of the city,\nand with much ado, seeing Monsieur de Bourbon\u2019s people, who thought it\nhad been a sally upon them, draw up to receive him, at last came to\nhimself, and saw his error; and then facing about, he retreated full\nspeed through the same breach by which he had gone out, but not till he\nhad first blindly advanced above three hundred paces into the open field.\nIt did not, however, fall out so well with Captain Giulio\u2019s ensign, at\nthe time when St. Paul was taken from us by the Comte de Bures and\nMonsieur de Reu, for he, being so astonished with fear as to throw\nhimself, colours and all, out of a porthole, was immediately, cut to\npieces by the enemy; and in the same siege, it was a very memorable fear\nthat so seized, contracted, and froze up the heart of a gentleman, that\nhe sank down, stone-dead, in the breach, without any manner of wound or\nhurt at all.  The like madness does sometimes push on a whole multitude;\nfor in one of the encounters that Germanicus had with the Germans, two\ngreat parties were so amazed with fear that they ran two opposite ways,\nthe one to the same place from which the other had fled.--[Tacit, Annal.,\ni.  63.]--Sometimes it adds wings to the heels, as in the two first:\nsometimes it nails them to the ground, and fetters them from moving; as\nwe read of the Emperor Theophilus, who, in a battle he lost against the\nAgarenes, was so astonished and stupefied that he had no power to fly--\n\n               \u201cAdeo pavor etiam auxilia formidat\u201d\n\n     [\u201cSo much does fear dread even the means of safety.\u201d--Quint.\n     Curt., ii.  II.]\n\n--till such time as Manuel, one of the principal commanders of his army,\nhaving jogged and shaked him so as to rouse him out of his trance, said\nto him, \u201cSir, if you will not follow me, I will kill you; for it is\nbetter you should lose your life than, by being taken, lose your empire.\u201d\n --[Zonaras, lib.  iii.]--But fear does then manifest its utmost power\nwhen it throws us upon a valiant despair, having before deprived us of\nall sense both of duty and honour.  In the first pitched battle the\nRomans lost against Hannibal, under the Consul Sempronius, a body of ten\nthousand foot, that had taken fright, seeing no other escape for their\ncowardice, went and threw themselves headlong upon the great battalion of\nthe enemies, which with marvellous force and fury they charged through\nand through, and routed with a very great slaughter of the Carthaginians,\nthus purchasing an ignominious flight at the same price they might have\ngained a glorious victory.--[Livy, xxi.  56.]\n\nThe thing in the world I am most afraid of is fear, that passion alone,\nin the trouble of it, exceeding all other accidents.  What affliction\ncould be greater or more just than that of Pompey\u2019s friends, who, in his\nship, were spectators of that horrible murder?  Yet so it was, that the\nfear of the Egyptian vessels they saw coming to board them, possessed\nthem with so great alarm that it is observed they thought of nothing but\ncalling upon the mariners to make haste, and by force of oars to escape\naway, till being arrived at Tyre, and delivered from fear, they had\nleisure to turn their thoughts to the loss of their captain, and to give\nvent to those tears and lamentations that the other more potent passion\nhad till then suspended.\n\n          \u201cTum pavor sapientiam omnem mihiex animo expectorat.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThen fear drove out all intelligence from my mind.\u201d--Ennius, ap.\n     Cicero, Tusc., iv.  8.]\n\nSuch as have been well rubbed in some skirmish, may yet, all wounded and\nbloody as they are, be brought on again the next day to charge; but such\nas have once conceived a good sound fear of the enemy, will never be made\nso much as to look him in the face.  Such as are in immediate fear of a\nlosing their estates, of banishment, or of slavery, live in perpetual\nanguish, and lose all appetite and repose; whereas such as are actually\npoor, slaves, or exiles, ofttimes live as merrily as other folk.  And the\nmany people who, impatient of the perpetual alarms of fear, have hanged\nor drowned themselves, or dashed themselves to pieces, give us\nsufficiently to understand that fear is more importunate and\ninsupportable than death itself.\n\nThe Greeks acknowledged another kind of fear, differing from any we have\nspoken of yet, that surprises us without any visible cause, by an impulse\nfrom heaven, so that whole nations and whole armies have been struck with\nit.  Such a one was that which brought so wonderful a desolation upon\nCarthage, where nothing was to be heard but affrighted voices and\noutcries; where the inhabitants were seen to sally out of their houses as\nto an alarm, and there to charge, wound, and kill one another, as if they\nhad been enemies come to surprise their city.  All things were in\ndisorder and fury till, with prayers and sacrifices, they had appeased\ntheir gods--[Diod.  Sic., xv. 7]; and this is that they call panic\nterrors.--[Ibid. ; Plutarch on Isis and Osiris, c.  8.]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\nTHAT MEN ARE NOT TO JUDGE OF OUR HAPPINESS TILL AFTER DEATH.\n\n     [Charron has borrowed with unusual liberality from this and the\n     succeeding chapter.  See Nodier, Questions, p. 206.]\n\n                         \u201cScilicet ultima semper\n               Exspectanda dies homini est; dicique beatus\n               Ante obitum nemo supremaque funera debet.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cWe should all look forward to our last day: no one can be called\n     happy till he is dead and buried.\u201d--Ovid, Met, iii. 135]\n\nThe very children know the story of King Croesus to this purpose, who\nbeing taken prisoner by Cyrus, and by him condemned to die, as he was\ngoing to execution cried out, \u201cO Solon, Solon!\u201d  which being presently\nreported to Cyrus, and he sending to inquire of him what it meant,\nCroesus gave him to understand that he now found the teaching Solon had\nformerly given him true to his cost; which was, \u201cThat men, however\nfortune may smile upon them, could never be said to be happy till they\nhad been seen to pass over the last day of their lives,\u201d by reason of the\nuncertainty and mutability of human things, which, upon very light and\ntrivial occasions, are subject to be totally changed into a quite\ncontrary condition.  And so it was that Agesilaus made answer to one who\nwas saying what a happy young man the King of Persia was, to come so\nyoung to so mighty a kingdom: \u201c\u2018Tis true,\u201d said he, \u201cbut neither was\nPriam unhappy at his years.\u201d--[Plutarch, Apothegms of the\nLacedaemonians.]--In a short time, kings of Macedon, successors to that\nmighty Alexander, became joiners and scriveners at Rome; a tyrant of\nSicily, a pedant at Corinth; a conqueror of one-half of the world and\ngeneral of so many armies, a miserable suppliant to the rascally officers\nof a king of Egypt: so much did the prolongation of five or six months of\nlife cost the great Pompey; and, in our fathers\u2019 days, Ludovico Sforza,\nthe tenth Duke of Milan, whom all Italy had so long truckled under, was\nseen to die a wretched prisoner at Loches, but not till he had lived ten\nyears in captivity,--[He was imprisoned by Louis XI. in an iron cage]--\nwhich was the worst part of his fortune.  The fairest of all queens,\n--[Mary, Queen of Scots.]--widow to the greatest king in Europe, did she\nnot come to die by the hand of an executioner?  Unworthy and barbarous\ncruelty!  And a thousand more examples there are of the same kind; for it\nseems that as storms and tempests have a malice against the proud and\novertowering heights of our lofty buildings, there are also spirits above\nthat are envious of the greatnesses here below:\n\n              \u201cUsque adeo res humanas vis abdita quaedam\n               Obterit, et pulchros fasces, saevasque secures\n               Proculcare, ac ludibrio sibi habere videtur.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cSo true it is that some occult power upsets human affairs, the\n     glittering fasces and the cruel axes spurns under foot, and seems to\n     make sport of them.\u201d--Lucretius, v.  1231.]\n\nAnd it should seem, also, that Fortune sometimes lies in wait to surprise\nthe last hour of our lives, to show the power she has, in a moment, to\noverthrow what she was so many years in building, making us cry out with\nLaberius:\n\n                         \u201cNimirum hac die\n          Una plus vixi mihi, quam vivendum fuit.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cI have lived longer by this one day than I should have\n     done.\u201d--Macrobius, ii.  7.]\n\nAnd, in this sense, this good advice of Solon may reasonably be taken;\nbut he, being a philosopher (with which sort of men the favours and\ndisgraces of Fortune stand for nothing, either to the making a man happy\nor unhappy, and with whom grandeurs and powers are accidents of a quality\nalmost indifferent) I am apt to think that he had some further aim, and\nthat his meaning was, that the very felicity of life itself, which\ndepends upon the tranquillity and contentment of a well-descended spirit,\nand the resolution and assurance of a well-ordered soul, ought never to\nbe attributed to any man till he has first been seen to play the last,\nand, doubtless, the hardest act of his part.  There may be disguise and\ndissimulation in all the rest: where these fine philosophical discourses\nare only put on, and where accident, not touching us to the quick, gives\nus leisure to maintain the same gravity of aspect; but, in this last\nscene of death, there is no more counterfeiting: we must speak out plain,\nand discover what there is of good and clean in the bottom of the pot,\n\n              \u201cNam vera; voces turn demum pectore ab imo\n               Ejiciuntur; et eripitur persona, manet res.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThen at last truth issues from the heart; the visor\u2019s gone,\n     the man remains.\u201d--Lucretius, iii.  57.]\n\nWherefore, at this last, all the other actions of our life ought to be\ntried and sifted: \u2018tis the master-day, \u2018tis the day that is judge of all\nthe rest, \u201c\u2018tis the day,\u201d says one of the ancients,--[Seneca, Ep., 102]--\n\u201cthat must be judge of all my foregoing years.\u201d  To death do I refer the\nassay of the fruit of all my studies: we shall then see whether my\ndiscourses came only from my mouth or from my heart.  I have seen many by\ntheir death give a good or an ill repute to their whole life.  Scipio,\nthe father-in-law of Pompey, in dying, well removed the ill opinion that\ntill then every one had conceived of him.  Epaminondas being asked which\nof the three he had in greatest esteem, Chabrias, Iphicrates, or himself.\n\u201cYou must first see us die,\u201d said he, \u201cbefore that question can be\nresolved.\u201d--[Plutarch, Apoth.]--And, in truth, he would infinitely\nwrong that man who would weigh him without the honour and grandeur of his\nend.\n\nGod has ordered all things as it has best pleased Him; but I have, in my\ntime, seen three of the most execrable persons that ever I knew in all\nmanner of abominable living, and the most infamous to boot, who all died\na very regular death, and in all circumstances composed, even to\nperfection.  There are brave and fortunate deaths: I have seen death cut\nthe thread of the progress of a prodigious advancement, and in the height\nand flower of its increase, of a certain person,--[Montaigne doubtless\nrefers to his friend Etienne de la Boetie, at whose death in 1563 he was\npresent.]--with so glorious an end that, in my opinion, his ambitious\nand generous designs had nothing in them so high and great as their\ninterruption.  He arrived, without completing his course, at the place to\nwhich his ambition aimed, with greater glory than he could either have\nhoped or desired, anticipating by his fall the name and power to which he\naspired in perfecting his career.  In the judgment I make of another\nman\u2019s life, I always observe how he carried himself at his death; and the\nprincipal concern I have for my own is that I may die well--that is,\npatiently and tranquilly.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\nTHAT TO STUDY PHILOSOPY IS TO LEARN TO DIE\n\nCicero says--[Tusc., i.  31.]--\u201cthat to study philosophy is nothing but\nto prepare one\u2019s self to die.\u201d  The reason of which is, because study and\ncontemplation do in some sort withdraw from us our soul, and employ it\nseparately from the body, which is a kind of apprenticeship and a\nresemblance of death; or, else, because all the wisdom and reasoning in\nthe world do in the end conclude in this point, to teach us not to fear\nto die.  And to say the truth, either our reason mocks us, or it ought to\nhave no other aim but our contentment only, nor to endeavour anything\nbut, in sum, to make us live well, and, as the Holy Scripture says, at\nour ease.  All the opinions of the world agree in this, that pleasure is\nour end, though we make use of divers means to attain it: they would,\notherwise, be rejected at the first motion; for who would give ear to him\nthat should propose affliction and misery for his end?  The controversies\nand disputes of the philosophical sects upon this point are merely\nverbal:\n\n               \u201cTranscurramus solertissimas nugas\u201d\n\n     [\u201cLet us skip over those subtle trifles.\u201d--Seneca, Ep., 117.]\n\n--there is more in them of opposition and obstinacy than is consistent\nwith so sacred a profession; but whatsoever personage a man takes upon\nhimself to perform, he ever mixes his own part with it.\n\nLet the philosophers say what they will, the thing at which we all aim,\neven in virtue is pleasure.  It amuses me to rattle in ears this word,\nwhich they so nauseate to and if it signify some supreme pleasure and\ncontentment, it is more due to the assistance of virtue than to any other\nassistance whatever.  This pleasure, for being more gay, more sinewy,\nmore robust and more manly, is only the more seriously voluptuous, and we\nought give it the name of pleasure, as that which is more favourable,\ngentle, and natural, and not that from which we have denominated it.  The\nother and meaner pleasure, if it could deserve this fair name, it ought\nto be by way of competition, and not of privilege.  I find it less exempt\nfrom traverses and inconveniences than virtue itself; and, besides that\nthe enjoyment is more momentary, fluid, and frail, it has its watchings,\nfasts, and labours, its sweat and its blood; and, moreover, has\nparticular to itself so many several sorts of sharp and wounding\npassions, and so dull a satiety attending it, as equal it to the severest\npenance.  And we mistake if we think that these incommodities serve it\nfor a spur and a seasoning to its sweetness (as in nature one contrary is\nquickened by another), or say, when we come to virtue, that like\nconsequences and difficulties overwhelm and render it austere and\ninaccessible; whereas, much more aptly than in voluptuousness, they\nennoble, sharpen, and heighten the perfect and divine pleasure they\nprocure us.  He renders himself unworthy of it who will counterpoise its\ncost with its fruit, and neither understands the blessing nor how to use\nit.  Those who preach to us that the quest of it is craggy, difficult,\nand painful, but its fruition pleasant, what do they mean by that but to\ntell us that it is always unpleasing?  For what human means will ever\nattain its enjoyment?  The most perfect have been fain to content\nthemselves to aspire unto it, and to approach it only, without ever\npossessing it.  But they are deceived, seeing that of all the pleasures\nwe know, the very pursuit is pleasant.  The attempt ever relishes of the\nquality of the thing to which it is directed, for it is a good part of,\nand consubstantial with, the effect.  The felicity and beatitude that\nglitters in Virtue, shines throughout all her appurtenances and avenues,\neven to the first entry and utmost limits.\n\nNow, of all the benefits that virtue confers upon us, the contempt of\ndeath is one of the greatest, as the means that accommodates human life\nwith a soft and easy tranquillity, and gives us a pure and pleasant taste\nof living, without which all other pleasure would be extinct.  Which is\nthe reason why all the rules centre and concur in this one article.  And\nalthough they all in like manner, with common accord, teach us also to\ndespise pain, poverty, and the other accidents to which human life is\nsubject, it is not, nevertheless, with the same solicitude, as well by\nreason these accidents are not of so great necessity, the greater part of\nmankind passing over their whole lives without ever knowing what poverty\nis, and some without sorrow or sickness, as Xenophilus the musician, who\nlived a hundred and six years in a perfect and continual health; as also\nbecause, at the worst, death can, whenever we please, cut short and put\nan end to all other inconveniences.  But as to death, it is inevitable:--\n\n              \u201cOmnes eodem cogimur; omnium\n               Versatur urna serius ocius\n               Sors exitura, et nos in aeternum\n               Exilium impositura cymbae.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cWe are all bound one voyage; the lot of all, sooner or later, is\n     to come out of the urn.  All must to eternal exile sail away.\u201d\n       --Hor., Od., ii.  3, 25.]\n\nand, consequently, if it frights us, \u2018tis a perpetual torment, for which\nthere is no sort of consolation.  There is no way by which it may not\nreach us.  We may continually turn our heads this way and that, as in a\nsuspected country:\n\n          \u201cQuae, quasi saxum Tantalo, semper impendet.\u201d\n\n          [\u201cEver, like Tantalus stone, hangs over us.\u201d\n            --Cicero, De Finib., i. 18.]\n\nOur courts of justice often send back condemned criminals to be executed\nupon the place where the crime was committed; but, carry them to fine\nhouses by the way, prepare for them the best entertainment you can--\n\n                    \u201cNon Siculae dapes\n               Dulcem elaborabunt saporem:\n               Non avium cyatheaceae cantus\n               Somnum reducent.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cSicilian dainties will not tickle their palates, nor the melody of\n     birds and harps bring back sleep.\u201d--Hor., Od., iii. 1, 18.]\n\nDo you think they can relish it? and that the fatal end of their journey\nbeing continually before their eyes, would not alter and deprave their\npalate from tasting these regalios?\n\n         \u201cAudit iter, numeratque dies, spatioque viarum\n          Metitur vitam; torquetur peste futura.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cHe considers the route, computes the time of travelling, measuring\n     his life by the length of the journey; and torments himself by\n     thinking of the blow to come.\u201d--Claudianus, in Ruf., ii.  137.]\n\nThe end of our race is death; \u2018tis the necessary object of our aim,\nwhich, if it fright us, how is it possible to advance a step without a\nfit of ague?  The remedy the vulgar use is not to think on\u2019t; but from\nwhat brutish stupidity can they derive so gross a blindness?  They must\nbridle the ass by the tail:\n\n          \u201cQui capite ipse suo instituit vestigia retro,\u201d\n\n     [\u201cWho in his folly seeks to advance backwards\u201d--Lucretius, iv. 474]\n\n\u2018tis no wonder if he be often trapped in the pitfall.  They affright\npeople with the very mention of death, and many cross themselves, as it\nwere the name of the devil.  And because the making a man\u2019s will is in\nreference to dying, not a man will be persuaded to take a pen in hand to\nthat purpose, till the physician has passed sentence upon and totally\ngiven him over, and then betwixt and terror, God knows in how fit a\ncondition of understanding he is to do it.\n\nThe Romans, by reason that this poor syllable death sounded so harshly to\ntheir ears and seemed so ominous, found out a way to soften and spin it\nout by a periphrasis, and instead of pronouncing such a one is dead,\nsaid, \u201cSuch a one has lived,\u201d or \u201cSuch a one has ceased to live\u201d\n --[Plutarch, Life of Cicero, c.  22:]--for, provided there was any mention\nof life in the case, though past, it carried yet some sound of\nconsolation.  And from them it is that we have borrowed our expression,\n\u201cThe late Monsieur such and such a one.\u201d--[\u201cfeu Monsieur un tel.\u201d]\nPeradventure, as the saying is, the term we have lived is worth our\nmoney.  I was born betwixt eleven and twelve o\u2019clock in the forenoon the\nlast day of February 1533, according to our computation, beginning the\nyear the 1st of January,--[This was in virtue of an ordinance of Charles\nIX. in 1563.  Previously the year commenced at Easter, so that the 1st\nJanuary 1563 became the first day of the year 1563.]--and it is now but\njust fifteen days since I was complete nine-and-thirty years old; I make\naccount to live, at least, as many more.  In the meantime, to trouble a\nman\u2019s self with the thought of a thing so far off were folly.  But what?\nYoung and old die upon the same terms; no one departs out of life\notherwise than if he had but just before entered into it; neither is any\nman so old and decrepit, who, having heard of Methuselah, does not think\nhe has yet twenty good years to come.  Fool that thou art!  who has\nassured unto thee the term of life?  Thou dependest upon physicians\u2019\ntales: rather consult effects and experience.  According to the common\ncourse of things, \u2018tis long since that thou hast lived by extraordinary\nfavour; thou hast already outlived the ordinary term of life.  And that\nit is so, reckon up thy acquaintance, how many more have died before they\narrived at thy age than have attained unto it; and of those who have\nennobled their lives by their renown, take but an account, and I dare\nlay a wager thou wilt find more who have died before than after\nfive-and-thirty years of age.  It is full both of reason and piety, too,\nto take example by the humanity of Jesus Christ Himself; now, He ended\nHis life at three-and-thirty years.  The greatest man, that was no more\nthan a man, Alexander, died also at the same age.  How many several ways\nhas death to surprise us?\n\n              \u201cQuid quisque, vitet, nunquam homini satis\n               Cautum est in horas.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cBe as cautious as he may, man can never foresee the danger that\n     may at any hour befal him.\u201d--Hor. O. ii.  13, 13.]\n\nTo omit fevers and pleurisies, who would ever have imagined that a duke\nof Brittany,--[Jean II. died 1305.]--should be pressed to death in a\ncrowd as that duke was at the entry of Pope Clement, my neighbour, into\nLyons?--[Montaigne speaks of him as if he had been a contemporary\nneighbour, perhaps because he was the Archbishop of Bordeaux.  Bertrand\nle Got was Pope under the title of Clement V., 1305-14.]--Hast thou not\nseen one of our kings--[Henry II., killed in a tournament, July 10,\n1559]--killed at a tilting, and did not one of his ancestors die by\njostle of a hog?--[Philip, eldest son of Louis le Gros.]--AEschylus,\nthreatened with the fall of a house, was to much purpose circumspect to\navoid that danger, seeing that he was knocked on the head by a tortoise\nfalling out of an eagle\u2019s talons in the air.  Another was choked with a\ngrape-stone;--[Val.  Max., ix.  12, ext. 2.]--an emperor killed with\nthe scratch of a comb in combing his head.  AEmilius Lepidus with a\nstumble at his own threshold,--[Pliny, Nat.  Hist., vii.  33.]--\nand Aufidius with a jostle against the door as he entered the\ncouncil-chamber.  And betwixt the very thighs of women, Cornelius Gallus\nthe proctor; Tigillinus, captain of the watch at Rome; Ludovico, son of\nGuido di Gonzaga, Marquis of Mantua; and (of worse example) Speusippus, a\nPlatonic philosopher, and one of our Popes.  The poor judge Bebius gave\nadjournment in a case for eight days; but he himself, meanwhile, was\ncondemned by death, and his own stay of life expired.  Whilst Caius\nJulius, the physician, was anointing the eyes of a patient, death closed\nhis own; and, if I may bring in an example of my own blood, a brother of\nmine, Captain St. Martin, a young man, three-and-twenty years old, who\nhad already given sufficient testimony of his valour, playing a match at\ntennis, received a blow of a ball a little above his right ear, which, as\nit gave no manner of sign of wound or contusion, he took no notice of it,\nnor so much as sat down to repose himself, but, nevertheless, died within\nfive or six hours after of an apoplexy occasioned by that blow.\n\nThese so frequent and common examples passing every day before our eyes,\nhow is it possible a man should disengage himself from the thought of\ndeath, or avoid fancying that it has us every moment by the throat?  What\nmatter is it, you will say, which way it comes to pass, provided a man\ndoes not terrify himself with the expectation?  For my part, I am of this\nmind, and if a man could by any means avoid it, though by creeping under\na calf\u2019s skin, I am one that should not be ashamed of the shift; all I\naim at is, to pass my time at my ease, and the recreations that will most\ncontribute to it, I take hold of, as little glorious and exemplary as you\nwill:\n\n              \u201cPraetulerim .  .  .  delirus inersque videri,\n               Dum mea delectent mala me, vel denique fallant,\n               Quam sapere, et ringi.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cI had rather seem mad and a sluggard, so that my defects are\n     agreeable to myself, or that I am not painfully conscious of them,\n     than be wise, and chaptious.\u201d--Hor., Ep., ii. 2, 126.]\n\nBut \u2018tis folly to think of doing anything that way.  They go, they come,\nthey gallop and dance, and not a word of death.  All this is very fine;\nbut withal, when it comes either to themselves, their wives, their\nchildren, or friends, surprising them at unawares and unprepared, then,\nwhat torment, what outcries, what madness and despair!  Did you ever see\nanything so subdued, so changed, and so confounded?  A man must,\ntherefore, make more early provision for it; and this brutish negligence,\ncould it possibly lodge in the brain of any man of sense (which I think\nutterly impossible), sells us its merchandise too dear.  Were it an enemy\nthat could be avoided, I would then advise to borrow arms even of\ncowardice itself; but seeing it is not, and that it will catch you as\nwell flying and playing the poltroon, as standing to\u2019t like an honest\nman:--\n\n                   \u201cNempe et fugacem persequitur virum,\n                    Nec parcit imbellis juventae\n                    Poplitibus timidoque tergo.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cHe pursues the flying poltroon, nor spares the hamstrings of the\n     unwarlike youth who turns his back\u201d--Hor., Ep., iii. 2, 14.]\n\nAnd seeing that no temper of arms is of proof to secure us:--\n\n              \u201cIlle licet ferro cautus, se condat et aere,\n               Mors tamen inclusum protrahet inde caput\u201d\n\n     [\u201cLet him hide beneath iron or brass in his fear, death will pull\n     his head out of his armour.\u201d--Propertious iii. 18]\n\n--let us learn bravely to stand our ground, and fight him.  And to begin\nto deprive him of the greatest advantage he has over us, let us take a\nway quite contrary to the common course.  Let us disarm him of his\nnovelty and strangeness, let us converse and be familiar with him, and\nhave nothing so frequent in our thoughts as death.  Upon all occasions\nrepresent him to our imagination in his every shape; at the stumbling of\na horse, at the falling of a tile, at the least prick with a pin, let us\npresently consider, and say to ourselves, \u201cWell, and what if it had been\ndeath itself?\u201d  and, thereupon, let us encourage and fortify ourselves.\nLet us evermore, amidst our jollity and feasting, set the remembrance of\nour frail condition before our eyes, never suffering ourselves to be so\nfar transported with our delights, but that we have some intervals of\nreflecting upon, and considering how many several ways this jollity of\nours tends to death, and with how many dangers it threatens it.  The\nEgyptians were wont to do after this manner, who in the height of their\nfeasting and mirth, caused a dried skeleton of a man to be brought into\nthe room to serve for a memento to their guests:\n\n              \u201cOmnem crede diem tibi diluxisse supremum\n               Grata superveniet, quae non sperabitur, hora.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThink each day when past is thy last; the next day, as unexpected,\n     will be the more welcome.\u201d--Hor., Ep., i. 4, 13.]\n\nWhere death waits for us is uncertain; let us look for him everywhere.\nThe premeditation of death is the premeditation of liberty; he who has\nlearned to die has unlearned to serve.  There is nothing evil in life for\nhim who rightly comprehends that the privation of life is no evil: to\nknow, how to die delivers us from all subjection and constraint.  Paulus\nEmilius answered him whom the miserable King of Macedon, his prisoner,\nsent to entreat him that he would not lead him in his triumph, \u201cLet him\nmake that request to himself.\u201d--[ Plutarch, Life of Paulus Aemilius,\nc. 17; Cicero, Tusc., v. 40.]\n\nIn truth, in all things, if nature do not help a little, it is very hard\nfor art and industry to perform anything to purpose.  I am in my own\nnature not melancholic, but meditative; and there is nothing I have more\ncontinually entertained myself withal than imaginations of death, even in\nthe most wanton time of my age:\n\n               \u201cJucundum quum aetas florida ver ageret.\u201d\n\n          [\u201cWhen my florid age rejoiced in pleasant spring.\u201d\n            --Catullus, lxviii.]\n\nIn the company of ladies, and at games, some have perhaps thought me\npossessed with some jealousy, or the uncertainty of some hope, whilst I\nwas entertaining myself with the remembrance of some one, surprised, a\nfew days before, with a burning fever of which he died, returning from an\nentertainment like this, with his head full of idle fancies of love and\njollity, as mine was then, and that, for aught I knew, the same-destiny\nwas attending me.\n\n          \u201cJam fuerit, nec post unquam revocare licebit.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cPresently the present will have gone, never to be recalled.\u201d\n      Lucretius, iii.  928.]\n\nYet did not this thought wrinkle my forehead any more than any other.\nIt is impossible but we must feel a sting in such imaginations as these,\nat first; but with often turning and returning them in one\u2019s mind, they,\nat last, become so familiar as to be no trouble at all: otherwise, I, for\nmy part, should be in a perpetual fright and frenzy; for never man was so\ndistrustful of his life, never man so uncertain as to its duration.\nNeither health, which I have hitherto ever enjoyed very strong and\nvigorous, and very seldom interrupted, does prolong, nor sickness\ncontract my hopes.  Every minute, methinks, I am escaping, and it\neternally runs in my mind, that what may be done to-morrow, may be done\nto-day.  Hazards and dangers do, in truth, little or nothing hasten our\nend; and if we consider how many thousands more remain and hang over our\nheads, besides the accident that immediately threatens us, we shall find\nthat the sound and the sick, those that are abroad at sea, and those that\nsit by the fire, those who are engaged in battle, and those who sit idle\nat home, are the one as near it as the other.\n\n     \u201cNemo altero fragilior est; nemo in crastinum sui certior.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cNo man is more fragile than another: no man more certain than\n     another of to-morrow.\u201d--Seneca, Ep., 91.]\n\nFor anything I have to do before I die, the longest leisure would appear\ntoo short, were it but an hour\u2019s business I had to do.\n\nA friend of mine the other day turning over my tablets, found therein a\nmemorandum of something I would have done after my decease, whereupon I\ntold him, as it was really true, that though I was no more than a\nleague\u2019s distance only from my own house, and merry and well, yet when\nthat thing came into my head, I made haste to write it down there,\nbecause I was not certain to live till I came home.  As a man that am\neternally brooding over my own thoughts, and confine them to my own\nparticular concerns, I am at all hours as well prepared as I am ever like\nto be, and death, whenever he shall come, can bring nothing along with\nhim I did not expect long before.  We should always, as near as we can,\nbe booted and spurred, and ready to go, and, above all things, take care,\nat that time, to have no business with any one but one\u2019s self:--\n\n                   \u201cQuid brevi fortes jaculamur avo\n                    Multa?\u201d\n\n     [\u201cWhy for so short a life tease ourselves with so many projects?\u201d\n       --Hor., Od., ii.  16, 17.]\n\nfor we shall there find work enough to do, without any need of addition.\nOne man complains, more than of death, that he is thereby prevented of a\nglorious victory; another, that he must die before he has married his\ndaughter, or educated his children; a third seems only troubled that he\nmust lose the society of his wife; a fourth, the conversation of his son,\nas the principal comfort and concern of his being.  For my part, I am,\nthanks be to God, at this instant in such a condition, that I am ready to\ndislodge, whenever it shall please Him, without regret for anything\nwhatsoever.  I disengage myself throughout from all worldly relations;\nmy leave is soon taken of all but myself.  Never did any one prepare to\nbid adieu to the world more absolutely and unreservedly, and to shake\nhands with all manner of interest in it, than I expect to do.  The\ndeadest deaths are the best:\n\n                    \u201c\u2018Miser, O miser,\u2019 aiunt, \u2018omnia ademit\n               Una dies infesta mihi tot praemia vitae.\u2019\u201d\n\n     [\u201c\u2018Wretch that I am,\u2019 they cry, \u2018one fatal day has deprived me of\n     all joys of life.\u2019\u201d--Lucretius, iii. 911.]\n\n\nAnd the builder,\n\n              \u201cManuet,\u201d says he, \u201copera interrupta, minaeque\n               Murorum ingentes.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThe works remain incomplete, the tall pinnacles of the walls\n     unmade.\u201d--AEneid, iv.  88.]\n\nA man must design nothing that will require so much time to the\nfinishing, or, at least, with no such passionate desire to see it brought\nto perfection.  We are born to action:\n\n               \u201cQuum moriar, medium solvar et inter opus.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cWhen I shall die, let it be doing that I had designed.\u201d\n       --Ovid, Amor., ii.  10, 36.]\n\nI would always have a man to be doing, and, as much as in him lies, to\nextend and spin out the offices of life; and then let death take me\nplanting my cabbages, indifferent to him, and still less of my gardens\nnot being finished.  I saw one die, who, at his last gasp, complained of\nnothing so much as that destiny was about to cut the thread of a\nchronicle he was then compiling, when he was gone no farther than the\nfifteenth or sixteenth of our kings:\n\n         \u201cIllud in his rebus non addunt: nec tibi earum\n          jam desiderium rerum super insidet una.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThey do not add, that dying, we have no longer a desire to possess\n     things.\u201d--Lucretius, iii.  913.]\n\nWe are to discharge ourselves from these vulgar and hurtful humours.\nTo this purpose it was that men first appointed the places of sepulture\nadjoining the churches, and in the most frequented places of the city, to\naccustom, says Lycurgus, the common people, women, and children, that\nthey should not be startled at the sight of a corpse, and to the end,\nthat the continual spectacle of bones, graves, and funeral obsequies\nshould put us in mind of our frail condition:\n\n              \u201cQuin etiam exhilarare viris convivia caede\n               Mos olim, et miscere epulis spectacula dira\n               Certantum ferro, saepe et super ipsa cadentum\n               Pocula, respersis non parco sanguine mensis.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cIt was formerly the custom to enliven banquets with slaughter, and\n     to combine with the repast the dire spectacle of men contending with\n     the sword, the dying in many cases falling upon the cups, and\n     covering the tables with blood.\u201d--Silius Italicus, xi. 51.]\n\nAnd as the Egyptians after their feasts were wont to present the company\nwith a great image of death, by one that cried out to them, \u201cDrink and be\nmerry, for such shalt thou be when thou art dead\u201d; so it is my custom to\nhave death not only in my imagination, but continually in my mouth.\nNeither is there anything of which I am so inquisitive, and delight to\ninform myself, as the manner of men\u2019s deaths, their words, looks, and\nbearing; nor any places in history I am so intent upon; and it is\nmanifest enough, by my crowding in examples of this kind, that I have a\nparticular fancy for that subject.  If I were a writer of books, I would\ncompile a register, with a comment, of the various deaths of men: he who\nshould teach men to die would at the same time teach them to live.\nDicarchus made one, to which he gave that title; but it was designed for\nanother and less profitable end.\n\nPeradventure, some one may object, that the pain and terror of dying so\ninfinitely exceed all manner of imagination, that the best fencer will be\nquite out of his play when it comes to the push.  Let them say what they\nwill: to premeditate is doubtless a very great advantage; and besides, is\nit nothing to go so far, at least, without disturbance or alteration?\nMoreover, Nature herself assists and encourages us: if the death be\nsudden and violent, we have not leisure to fear; if otherwise, I perceive\nthat as I engage further in my disease, I naturally enter into a certain\nloathing and disdain of life.  I find I have much more ado to digest this\nresolution of dying, when I am well in health, than when languishing of a\nfever; and by how much I have less to do with the commodities of life,\nby reason that I begin to lose the use and pleasure of them, by so much I\nlook upon death with less terror.  Which makes me hope, that the further\nI remove from the first, and the nearer I approach to the latter, I shall\nthe more easily exchange the one for the other.  And, as I have\nexperienced in other occurrences, that, as Caesar says, things often\nappear greater to us at distance than near at hand, I have found, that\nbeing well, I have had maladies in much greater horror than when really\nafflicted with them.  The vigour wherein I now am, the cheerfulness and\ndelight wherein I now live, make the contrary estate appear in so great a\ndisproportion to my present condition, that, by imagination, I magnify\nthose inconveniences by one-half, and apprehend them to be much more\ntroublesome, than I find them really to be, when they lie the most heavy\nupon me; I hope to find death the same.\n\nLet us but observe in the ordinary changes and declinations we daily\nsuffer, how nature deprives us of the light and sense of our bodily\ndecay.  What remains to an old man of the vigour of his youth and better\ndays?\n\n               \u201cHeu! senibus vitae portio quanta manet.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cAlas, to old men what portion of life remains!\u201d---Maximian, vel\n     Pseudo-Gallus, i. 16.]\n\nCaesar, to an old weather-beaten soldier of his guards, who came to ask\nhim leave that he might kill himself, taking notice of his withered body\nand decrepit motion, pleasantly answered, \u201cThou fanciest, then, that thou\nart yet alive.\u201d--[Seneca, Ep., 77.]--Should a man fall into this\ncondition on the sudden, I do not think humanity capable of enduring such\na change: but nature, leading us by the hand, an easy and, as it were, an\ninsensible pace, step by step conducts us to that miserable state, and by\nthat means makes it familiar to us, so that we are insensible of the\nstroke when our youth dies in us, though it be really a harder death than\nthe final dissolution of a languishing body, than the death of old age;\nforasmuch as the fall is not so great from an uneasy being to none at\nall, as it is from a sprightly and flourishing being to one that is\ntroublesome and painful.  The body, bent and bowed, has less force to\nsupport a burden; and it is the same with the soul, and therefore it is,\nthat we are to raise her up firm and erect against the power of this\nadversary.  For, as it is impossible she should ever be at rest, whilst\nshe stands in fear of it; so, if she once can assure herself, she may\nboast (which is a thing as it were surpassing human condition) that it is\nimpossible that disquiet, anxiety, or fear, or any other disturbance,\nshould inhabit or have any place in her:\n\n              \u201cNon vulnus instants Tyranni\n               Mentha cadi solida, neque Auster\n               Dux inquieti turbidus Adriae,\n               Nec fulminantis magna Jovis manus.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cNot the menacing look of a tyrant shakes her well-settled soul,\n     nor turbulent Auster, the prince of the stormy Adriatic, nor yet the\n     strong hand of thundering Jove, such a temper moves.\u201d\n      --Hor., Od., iii.  3, 3.]\n\nShe is then become sovereign of all her lusts and passions, mistress of\nnecessity, shame, poverty, and all the other injuries of fortune.  Let\nus, therefore, as many of us as can, get this advantage; \u2018tis the true\nand sovereign liberty here on earth, that fortifies us wherewithal to\ndefy violence and injustice, and to contemn prisons and chains:\n\n                              \u201cIn manicis et\n               Compedibus saevo te sub custode tenebo.\n               Ipse Deus, simul atque volam, me solvet.  Opinor,\n               Hoc sentit; moriar; mors ultima linea rerum est.\u201d\n\n          [\u201cI will keep thee in fetters and chains, in custody of a\n          savage keeper.--A god will when I ask Him, set me free.\n          This god I think is death.  Death is the term of all things.\u201d\n           --Hor., Ep., i.  16, 76.]\n\nOur very religion itself has no surer human foundation than the contempt\nof life.  Not only the argument of reason invites us to it--for why\nshould we fear to lose a thing, which being lost, cannot be lamented?\n--but, also, seeing we are threatened by so many sorts of death, is it not\ninfinitely worse eternally to fear them all, than once to undergo one of\nthem?  And what matters it, when it shall happen, since it is inevitable?\nTo him that told Socrates, \u201cThe thirty tyrants have sentenced thee to\ndeath\u201d; \u201cAnd nature them,\u201d said he.--[Socrates was not condemned to death\nby the thirty tyrants, but by the Athenians.-Diogenes Laertius, ii.35.]--\nWhat a ridiculous thing it is to trouble ourselves about taking the only\nstep that is to deliver us from all trouble!  As our birth brought us the\nbirth of all things, so in our death is the death of all things included.\nAnd therefore to lament that we shall not be alive a hundred years hence,\nis the same folly as to be sorry we were not alive a hundred years ago.\nDeath is the beginning of another life.  So did we weep, and so much it\ncost us to enter into this, and so did we put off our former veil in\nentering into it.  Nothing can be a grievance that is but once.  Is it\nreasonable so long to fear a thing that will so soon be despatched?\nLong life, and short, are by death made all one; for there is no long,\nnor short, to things that are no more.  Aristotle tells us that there are\ncertain little beasts upon the banks of the river Hypanis, that never\nlive above a day: they which die at eight of the clock in the morning,\ndie in their youth, and those that die at five in the evening, in their\ndecrepitude: which of us would not laugh to see this moment of\ncontinuance put into the consideration of weal or woe?  The most and the\nleast, of ours, in comparison with eternity, or yet with the duration of\nmountains, rivers, stars, trees, and even of some animals, is no less\nridiculous.--[ Seneca, Consol. ad Marciam, c. 20.]\n\nBut nature compels us to it.  \u201cGo out of this world,\u201d says she, \u201cas you\nentered into it; the same pass you made from death to life, without\npassion or fear, the same, after the same manner, repeat from life to\ndeath.  Your death is a part of the order of the universe, \u2018tis a part of\nthe life of the world.\n\n                    \u201cInter se mortales mutua vivunt\n                    ................................\n                    Et, quasi cursores, vitai lampada tradunt.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cMortals, amongst themselves, live by turns, and, like the runners\n     in the games, give up the lamp, when they have won the race, to the\n     next comer.--\u201d Lucretius, ii.  75, 78.]\n\n\u201cShall I exchange for you this beautiful contexture of things?  \u2018Tis the\ncondition of your creation; death is a part of you, and whilst you\nendeavour to evade it, you evade yourselves.  This very being of yours\nthat you now enjoy is equally divided betwixt life and death.  The day of\nyour birth is one day\u2019s advance towards the grave:\n\n          \u201cPrima, qux vitam dedit, hora carpsit.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThe first hour that gave us life took away also an hour.\u201d\n      --Seneca, Her.

The perpetual work of your life is but to lay\nthe foundation of death.  You are in death, whilst you are in life,\nbecause you still are after death, when you are no more alive; or, if you\nhad rather have it so, you are dead after life, but dying all the while\nyou live; and death handles the dying much more rudely than the dead, and\nmore sensibly and essentially.  If you have made your profit of life, you\nhave had enough of it; go your way satisfied.\n\n               \u201cCur non ut plenus vita; conviva recedis?\u201d\n\n     [\u201cWhy not depart from life as a sated guest from a feast?\n     \u201cLucretius, iii.  951.]\n\n\u201cIf you have not known how to make the best use of it, if it was\nunprofitable to you, what need you care to lose it, to what end would you\ndesire longer to keep it?\n\n               \u201c\u2018Cur amplius addere quaeris,\n          Rursum quod pereat male, et ingratum occidat omne?\u2019\n\n     [\u201cWhy seek to add longer life, merely to renew ill-spent time, and\n     be again tormented?\u201d--Lucretius, iii. 914.]\n\n\u201cLife in itself is neither good nor evil; it is the scene of good or evil\nas you make it.\u2019 And, if you have lived a day, you have seen all: one day\nis equal and like to all other days.

If you have observed the\nrevolution of my four seasons, they comprehend the infancy, the youth,\nthe virility, and the old age of the world: the year has played his part,\nand knows no other art but to begin again; it will always be the same\nthing:\n\n               \u201c\u2018Versamur ibidem, atque insumus usque.\u2019\n\n     [\u201cWe are turning in the same circle, ever therein confined.\u201d\n      --Lucretius, iii. 1093.]\n\n               \u201c\u2018Atque in se sua per vestigia volvitur annus.\u2019\n\n     [\u201cThe year is ever turning around in the same footsteps.\u201d\n      --Virgil, Georg., ii. 402.]\n\n\u201cI am not prepared to create for you any new recreations:\n\n             \u201c\u2018Nam tibi prxterea quod machiner, inveniamque\n               Quod placeat, nihil est; eadem sunt omnia semper.\u2019\n\n     [\u201cI can devise, nor find anything else to please you: \u2018tis the same\n     thing over and over again.\u201d--Lucretius iii. 957]\n\n\u201cGive place to others, as others have given place to you.

The utility of living consists\nnot in the length of days, but in the use of time; a man may have lived\nlong, and yet lived but a little.  Make use of time while it is present\nwith you.  It depends upon your will, and not upon the number of days, to\nhave a sufficient length of life.  Is it possible you can imagine never\nto arrive at the place towards which you are continually going? and yet\nthere is no journey but hath its end.  And, if company will make it more\npleasant or more easy to you, does not all the world go the self-same\nway?\n\n          \u201c\u2018Omnia te, vita perfuncta, sequentur.\u2019\n\n          [\u201cAll things, then, life over, must follow thee.\u201d\n           --Lucretius, iii.  981.]\n\n\u201cDoes not all the world dance the same brawl that you do?

It must,\ntherefore, needs be very foolish to condemn a thing you have neither\nexperimented in your own person, nor by that of any other.  Why dost thou\ncomplain of me and of destiny?  Do we do thee any wrong?  Is it for thee\nto govern us, or for us to govern thee?  Though, peradventure, thy age\nmay not be accomplished, yet thy life is: a man of low stature is as much\na man as a giant; neither men nor their lives are measured by the ell.\nChiron refused to be immortal, when he was acquainted with the conditions\nunder which he was to enjoy it, by the god of time itself and its\nduration, his father Saturn.  Do but seriously consider how much more\ninsupportable and painful an immortal life would be to man than what I\nhave already given him.  If you had not death, you would eternally curse\nme for having deprived you of it; I have mixed a little bitterness with\nit, to the end, that seeing of what convenience it is, you might not too\ngreedily and indiscreetly seek and embrace it: and that you might be so\nestablished in this moderation, as neither to nauseate life, nor have any\nantipathy for dying, which I have decreed you shall once do, I have\ntempered the one and the other betwixt pleasure and pain.  It was I that\ntaught Thales, the most eminent of your sages, that to live and to die\nwere indifferent; which made him, very wisely, answer him, \u2018Why then he\ndid not die?\u2019  \u2018Because,\u2019 said he, \u2018it is indifferent.\u2019--[Diogenes\nLaertius, i.  35.]--Water, earth, air, and fire, and the other parts of\nthis creation of mine, are no more instruments of thy life than they are\nof thy death.  Why dost thou fear thy last day? it contributes no more to\nthy dissolution, than every one of the rest: the last step is not the\ncause of lassitude: it does not confess it.  Every day travels towards\ndeath; the last only arrives at it.\u201d  These are the good lessons our\nmother Nature teaches.\n\nI have often considered with myself whence it should proceed, that in war\nthe image of death, whether we look upon it in ourselves or in others,\nshould, without comparison, appear less dreadful than at home in our own\nhouses (for if it were not so, it would be an army of doctors and whining\nmilksops), and that being still in all places the same, there should be,\nnotwithstanding, much more assurance in peasants and the meaner sort of\npeople, than in others of better quality.  I believe, in truth, that it\nis those terrible ceremonies and preparations wherewith we set it out,\nthat more terrify us than the thing itself; a new, quite contrary way of\nliving; the cries of mothers, wives, and children; the visits of\nastounded and afflicted friends; the attendance of pale and blubbering\nservants; a dark room, set round with burning tapers; our beds environed\nwith physicians and divines; in sum, nothing but ghostliness and horror\nround about us; we seem dead and buried already.  Children are afraid\neven of those they are best acquainted with, when disguised in a visor;\nand so \u2018tis with us; the visor must be removed as well from things as\nfrom persons, that being taken away, we shall find nothing underneath but\nthe very same death that a mean servant or a poor chambermaid died a day\nor two ago, without any manner of apprehension.  Happy is the death that\ndeprives us of leisure for preparing such ceremonials.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\nOF THE FORCE OF IMAGINATION\n\n            \u201cFortis imaginatio generat casum,\u201d say the schoolmen.\n\n     [\u201cA strong imagination begets the event itself.\u201d--Axiom. Scholast.]\n\nI am one of those who are most sensible of the power of imagination:\nevery one is jostled by it, but some are overthrown by it.  It has a very\npiercing impression upon me; and I make it my business to avoid, wanting\nforce to resist it.  I could live by the sole help of healthful and jolly\ncompany: the very sight of another\u2019s pain materially pains me, and I\noften usurp the sensations of another person.  A perpetual cough in\nanother tickles my lungs and throat.  I more unwillingly visit the sick\nin whom by love and duty I am interested, than those I care not for, to\nwhom I less look.  I take possession of the disease I am concerned at,\nand take it to myself.  I do not at all wonder that fancy should give\nfevers and sometimes kill such as allow it too much scope, and are too\nwilling to entertain it.  Simon Thomas was a great physician of his time:\nI remember, that happening one day at Toulouse to meet him at a rich old\nfellow\u2019s house, who was troubled with weak lungs, and discoursing with\nthe patient about the method of his cure, he told him, that one thing\nwhich would be very conducive to it, was to give me such occasion to be\npleased with his company, that I might come often to see him, by which\nmeans, and by fixing his eyes upon the freshness of my complexion, and\nhis imagination upon the sprightliness and vigour that glowed in my\nyouth, and possessing all his senses with the flourishing age wherein I\nthen was, his habit of body might, peradventure, be amended; but he\nforgot to say that mine, at the same time, might be made worse.  Gallus\nVibius so much bent his mind to find out the essence and motions of\nmadness, that, in the end, he himself went out of his wits, and to such a\ndegree, that he could never after recover his judgment, and might brag\nthat he was become a fool by too much wisdom.  Some there are who through\nfear anticipate the hangman; and there was the man, whose eyes being\nunbound to have his pardon read to him, was found stark dead upon the\nscaffold, by the stroke of imagination.  We start, tremble, turn pale,\nand blush, as we are variously moved by imagination; and, being a-bed,\nfeel our bodies agitated with its power to that degree, as even sometimes\nto expiring.  And boiling youth, when fast asleep, grows so warm with\nfancy, as in a dream to satisfy amorous desires:--\n\n         \u201cUt, quasi transactis saepe omnibu rebu, profundant\n          Fluminis ingentes, fluctus, vestemque cruentent.\u201d\n\nAlthough it be no new thing to see horns grown in a night on the forehead\nof one that had none when he went to bed, notwithstanding, what befell\nCippus, King of Italy,  is memorable; who having one day been a very\ndelighted spectator of a bullfight, and having all the night dreamed that\nhe had horns on his head, did, by the force of imagination, really cause\nthem to grow there.  Passion gave to the son of Croesus the voice which\nnature had denied him.  And Antiochus fell into a fever, inflamed with\nthe beauty of Stratonice, too deeply imprinted in his soul.  Pliny\npretends to have seen Lucius Cossitius, who from a woman was turned into\na man upon her very wedding-day.  Pontanus and others report the like\nmetamorphosis to have happened in these latter days in Italy.  And,\nthrough the vehement desire of him and his mother:\n\n          \u201cVolta puer solvit, quae foemina voverat, Iphis.\u201d\n\nMyself passing by Vitry le Francois,  saw a man the Bishop of Soissons\nhad, in confirmation, called Germain, whom all the inhabitants of the\nplace had known to be a girl till two-and-twenty years of age, called\nMary.  He was, at the time of my being there, very full of beard, old,\nand not married.  He told us, that by straining himself in a leap his\nmale organs came out; and the girls of that place have, to this day, a\nsong, wherein they advise one another not to take too great strides, for\nfear of being turned into men, as Mary Germain was.  It is no wonder if\nthis sort of accident frequently happen; for if imagination have any\npower in such things, it is so continually and vigorously bent upon this\nsubject, that to the end it may not so often relapse into the same\nthought and violence of desire, it were better, once for all, to give\nthese young wenches the things they long for.\n\nSome attribute the scars of King Dagobert and of St. Francis to the force\nof imagination.  It is said, that by it bodies will sometimes be removed\nfrom their places; and Celsus tells us of a priest whose soul would be\nravished into such an ecstasy that the body would, for a long time,\nremain without sense or respiration.  St. Augustine makes mention of\nanother, who, upon the hearing of any lamentable or doleful cries, would\npresently fall into a swoon, and be so far out of himself, that it was in\nvain to call, bawl in his ears, pinch or burn him, till he voluntarily\ncame to himself; and then he would say, that he had heard voices as it\nwere afar off, and did feel when they pinched and burned him; and, to\nprove that this was no obstinate dissimulation in defiance of his sense\nof feeling, it was manifest, that all the while he had neither pulse nor\nbreathing.\n\n\u2018Tis very probable, that visions, enchantments, and all extraordinary\neffects of that nature, derive their credit principally from the power of\nimagination, working and making its chiefest impression upon vulgar and\nmore easy souls, whose belief is so strangely imposed upon, as to think\nthey see what they do not see.\n\nI am not satisfied whether those pleasant ligatures--[Les nouements\nd\u2019aiguillettes, as they were called, knots tied by some one, at a\nwedding, on a strip of leather, cotton, or silk, and which, especially\nwhen passed through the wedding-ring, were supposed to have the magical\neffect of preventing a consummation of the marriage until they were\nuntied.  See Louandre, La Sorcellerie, 1853, p. 73.  The same\nsuperstition and appliance existed in England.]--with which this age of\nours is so occupied, that there is almost no other talk, are not mere\nvoluntary impressions of apprehension and fear; for I know, by\nexperience, in the case of a particular friend of mine, one for whom I\ncan be as responsible as for myself, and a man that cannot possibly fall\nunder any manner of suspicion of insufficiency, and as little of being\nenchanted, who having heard a companion of his make a relation of an\nunusual frigidity that surprised him at a very unseasonable time; being\nafterwards himself engaged upon the same account, the horror of the\nformer story on a sudden so strangely possessed his imagination, that he\nran the same fortune the other had done; and from that time forward, the\nscurvy remembrance of his disaster running in his mind and tyrannising\nover him, he was subject to relapse into the same misfortune.  He found\nsome remedy, however, for this fancy in another fancy, by himself frankly\nconfessing and declaring beforehand to the party with whom he was to have\nto do, this subjection of his, by which means, the agitation of his soul\nwas, in some sort, appeased; and knowing that, now, some such\nmisbehaviour was expected from him, the restraint upon his faculties grew\nless.  And afterwards, at such times as he was in no such apprehension,\nwhen setting about the act (his thoughts being then disengaged and free,\nand his body in its true and natural estate) he was at leisure to cause\nthe part to be handled and communicated to the knowledge of the other\nparty, he was totally freed from that vexatious infirmity.  After a man\nhas once done a woman right, he is never after in danger of misbehaving\nhimself with that person, unless upon the account of some excusable\nweakness.  Neither is this disaster to be feared, but in adventures,\nwhere the soul is overextended with desire or respect, and, especially,\nwhere the opportunity is of an unforeseen and pressing nature; in those\ncases, there is no means for a man to defend himself from such a\nsurprise, as shall put him altogether out of sorts.  I have known some,\nwho have secured themselves from this mischance, by coming half sated\nelsewhere, purposely to abate the ardour of the fury, and others, who,\nbeing grown old, find themselves less impotent by being less able; and\none, who found an advantage in being assured by a friend of his, that he\nhad a counter-charm of enchantments that would secure him from this\ndisgrace.  The story itself is not, much amiss, and therefore you shall\nhave it.\n\nA Count of a very great family, and with whom I was very intimate, being\nmarried to a fair lady, who had formerly been courted by one who was at\nthe wedding, all his friends were in very great fear; but especially an\nold lady his kinswoman, who had the ordering of the solemnity, and in\nwhose house it was kept, suspecting his rival would offer foul play by\nthese sorceries.  Which fear she communicated to me.  I bade her rely\nupon me: I had, by chance, about me a certain flat plate of gold, whereon\nwere graven some celestial figures, supposed good against sunstroke or\npains in the head, being applied to the suture: where, that it might the\nbetter remain firm, it was sewed to a ribbon to be tied under the chin; a\nfoppery cousin-german to this of which I am speaking.  Jaques Pelletier,\nwho lived in my house, had presented this to me for a singular rarity.\nI had a fancy to make some use of this knack, and therefore privately\ntold the Count, that he might possibly run the same fortune other\nbridegrooms had sometimes done, especially some one being in the house,\nwho, no doubt, would be glad to do him such a courtesy: but let him\nboldly go to bed.  For I would do him the office of a friend, and, if\nneed were, would not spare a miracle it was in my power to do, provided\nhe would engage to me, upon his honour, to keep it to himself; and only,\nwhen they came to bring him his caudle,--[A custom in France to bring the\nbridegroom a caudle in the middle of the night on his wedding-night]--\nif matters had not gone well with him, to give me such a sign, and leave\nthe rest to me.  Now he had had his ears so battered, and his mind so\nprepossessed with the eternal tattle of this business, that when he came\nto\u2019t, he did really find himself tied with the trouble of his\nimagination, and, accordingly, at the time appointed, gave me the sign.\nWhereupon, I whispered him in the ear, that he should rise, under\npretence of putting us out of the room, and after a jesting manner pull\nmy nightgown from my shoulders--we were of much about the same height--\nthrow it over his own, and there keep it till he had performed what I had\nappointed him to do, which was, that when we were all gone out of the\nchamber, he should withdraw to make water, should three times repeat such\nand such words, and as often do such and such actions; that at every of\nthe three times, he should tie the ribbon I put into his hand about his\nmiddle, and be sure to place the medal that was fastened to it, the\nfigures in such a posture, exactly upon his reins, which being done, and\nhaving the last of the three times so well girt and fast tied the ribbon\nthat it could neither untie nor slip from its place, let him confidently\nreturn to his business, and withal not forget to spread my gown upon the\nbed, so that it might be sure to cover them both.  These ape\u2019s tricks are\nthe main of the effect, our fancy being so far seduced as to believe that\nsuch strange means must, of necessity, proceed from some abstruse\nscience: their very inanity gives them weight and reverence.  And,\ncertain it is, that my figures approved themselves more venereal than\nsolar, more active than prohibitive.  \u2018Twas a sudden whimsey, mixed with\na little curiosity, that made me do a thing so contrary to my nature; for\nI am an enemy to all subtle and counterfeit actions, and abominate all\nmanner of trickery, though it be for sport, and to an advantage; for\nthough the action may not be vicious in itself, its mode is vicious.\n\nAmasis, King of Egypt, having married Laodice, a very beautiful Greek\nvirgin, though noted for his abilities elsewhere, found himself quite\nanother man with his wife, and could by no means enjoy her; at which he\nwas so enraged, that he threatened to kill her, suspecting her to be a\nwitch.  As \u2018tis usual in things that consist in fancy, she put him upon\ndevotion, and having accordingly made his vows to Venus, he found himself\ndivinely restored the very first night after his oblations and\nsacrifices.  Now women are to blame to entertain us with that disdainful,\ncoy, and angry countenance, which extinguishes our vigour, as it kindles\nour desire; which made the daughter-in-law of Pythagoras--[Theano, the\nlady in question was the wife, not the daughter-in-law of Pythagoras.]--\nsay, \u201cThat the woman who goes to bed to a man, must put off her modesty\nwith her petticoat, and put it on again with the same.\u201d  The soul of the\nassailant, being disturbed with many several alarms, readily loses the\npower of performance; and whoever the imagination has once put this trick\nupon, and confounded with the shame of it (and she never does it but at\nthe first acquaintance, by reason men are then more ardent and eager, and\nalso, at this first account a man gives of himself, he is much more\ntimorous of miscarrying), having made an ill beginning, he enters into\nsuch fever and despite at the accident, as are apt to remain and continue\nwith him upon following occasions.\n\nMarried people, having all their time before them, ought never to compel\nor so much as to offer at the feat, if they do not find themselves quite\nready: and it is less unseemly to fail of handselling the nuptial sheets,\nwhen a man perceives himself full of agitation and trembling, and to\nawait another opportunity at more private and more composed leisure, than\nto make himself perpetually miserable, for having misbehaved himself and\nbeen baffled at the first assault.  Till possession be taken, a man that\nknows himself subject to this infirmity, should leisurely and by degrees\nmake several little trials and light offers, without obstinately\nattempting at once, to Force an absolute conquest over his own mutinous\nand indisposed faculties.  Such as know their members to be naturally\nobedient, need take no other care but only to counterplot their\nfantasies.\n\nThe indocile liberty of this member is very remarkable, so importunately\nunruly in its tumidity and impatience, when we do not require it, and so\nunseasonably disobedient, when we stand most in need of it: so\nimperiously contesting in authority with the will, and with so much\nhaughty obstinacy denying all solicitation, both of hand and mind.  And\nyet, though his rebellion is so universally complained of, and that proof\nis thence deduced to condemn him, if he had, nevertheless, feed me\nto plead his cause, I should peradventure, bring the rest of his\nfellow-members into suspicion of complotting this mischief against him,\nout of pure envy at the importance and pleasure especial to his\nemployment; and to have, by confederacy, armed the whole world against\nhim, by malevolently charging him alone, with their common offence.  For\nlet any one consider, whether there is any one part of our bodies that\ndoes not often refuse to perform its office at the precept of the will,\nand that does not often exercise its function in defiance of her command.\nThey have every one of them passions of their own, that rouse and awaken,\nstupefy and benumb them, without our leave or consent.  How often do the\ninvoluntary motions of the countenance discover our inward thoughts, and\nbetray our most private secrets to the bystanders.  The same cause that\nanimates this member, does also, without our knowledge, animate the\nlungs, pulse, and heart, the sight of a pleasing object imperceptibly\ndiffusing a flame through all our parts, with a feverish motion.  Is\nthere nothing but these veins and muscles that swell and flag without the\nconsent, not only of the will, but even of our knowledge also?  We do not\ncommand our hairs to stand on end, nor our skin to shiver either with\nfear or desire; the hands often convey themselves to parts to which we do\nnot direct them; the tongue will be interdict, and the voice congealed,\nwhen we know not how to help it.  When we have nothing to eat, and would\nwillingly forbid it, the appetite does not, for all that, forbear to stir\nup the parts that are subject to it, no more nor less than the other\nappetite we were speaking of, and in like manner, as unseasonably leaves\nus, when it thinks fit.  The vessels that serve to discharge the belly\nhave their own proper dilatations and compressions, without and beyond\nour concurrence, as well as those which are destined to purge the reins;\nand that which, to justify the prerogative of the will, St. Augustine\nurges, of having seen a man who could command his rear to discharge as\noften together as he pleased, Vives, his commentator, yet further\nfortifies with another example in his time,--of one that could break wind\nin tune; but these cases do not suppose any more pure obedience in that\npart; for is anything commonly more tumultuary or indiscreet?  To which\nlet me add, that I myself knew one so rude and ungoverned, as for forty\nyears together made his master vent with one continued and unintermitted\noutbursting, and \u2018tis like will do so till he die of it.  And I could\nheartily wish, that I only knew by reading, how often a man\u2019s belly, by\nthe denial of one single puff, brings him to the very door of an\nexceeding painful death; and that the emperor,--[The Emperor Claudius,\nwho, however, according to Suetonius (Vita, c. 32), only intended to\nauthorise this singular privilege by an edict.]--who gave liberty to let\nfly in all places, had, at the same time, given us power to do it.  But\nfor our will, in whose behalf we prefer this accusation, with how much\ngreater probability may we reproach herself with mutiny and sedition, for\nher irregularity and disobedience?  Does she always will what we would\nhave her to do?  Does she not often will what we forbid her to will, and\nthat to our manifest prejudice?  Does she suffer herself, more than any\nof the rest, to be governed and directed by the results of our reason? To\nconclude, I should move, in the behalf of the gentleman, my client, it\nmight be considered, that in this fact, his cause being inseparably and\nindistinctly conjoined with an accessory, yet he only is called in\nquestion, and that by arguments and accusations, which cannot be charged\nupon the other; whose business, indeed, it is sometimes inopportunely to\ninvite, but never to refuse, and invite, moreover, after a tacit and\nquiet manner; and therefore is the malice and injustice of his accusers\nmost manifestly apparent.  But be it how it will, protesting against the\nproceedings of the advocates and judges, nature will, in the meantime,\nproceed after her own way, who had done but well, had she endowed this\nmember with some particular privilege; the author of the sole immortal\nwork of mortals; a divine work, according to Socrates; and love, the\ndesire of immortality, and himself an immortal demon.\n\nSome one, perhaps, by such an effect of imagination may have had the good\nluck to leave behind him here, the scrofula, which his companion who has\ncome after, has carried with him into Spain.  And \u2018tis for this reason\nyou may see why men in such cases require a mind prepared for the thing\nthat is to be done.  Why do the physicians possess, before hand, their\npatients\u2019 credulity with so many false promises of cure, if not to the\nend, that the effect of imagination may supply the imposture of their\ndecoctions?  They know very well, that a great master of their trade has\ngiven it under his hand, that he has known some with whom the very sight\nof physic would work.  All which conceits come now into my head, by the\nremembrance of a story was told me by a domestic apothecary of my\nfather\u2019s, a blunt Swiss, a nation not much addicted to vanity and lying,\nof a merchant he had long known at Toulouse, who being a valetudinary,\nand much afflicted with the stone, had often occasion to take clysters,\nof which he caused several sorts to be prescribed him by the physicians,\nacccording to the accidents of his disease; which, being brought him, and\nnone of the usual forms, as feeling if it were not too hot, and the like,\nbeing omitted, he lay down, the syringe advanced, and all ceremonies\nperformed, injection alone excepted; after which, the apothecary being\ngone, and the patient accommodated as if he had really received a\nclyster, he found the same operation and effect that those do who have\ntaken one indeed; and if at any time the physician did not find the\noperation sufficient, he would usually give him two or three more doses,\nafter the same manner.  And the fellow swore, that to save charges (for\nhe paid as if he had really taken them) this sick man\u2019s wife, having\nsometimes made trial of warm water only, the effect discovered the cheat,\nand finding these would do no good, was fain to return to the old way.\n\nA woman fancying she had swallowed a pin in a piece of bread, cried and\nlamented as though she had an intolerable pain in her throat, where she\nthought she felt it stick; but an ingenious fellow that was brought to\nher, seeing no outward tumour nor alteration, supposing it to be only a\nconceit taken at some crust of bread that had hurt her as it went down,\ncaused her to vomit, and, unseen, threw a crooked pin into the basin,\nwhich the woman no sooner saw, but believing she had cast it up, she\npresently found herself eased of her pain.  I myself knew a gentleman,\nwho having treated a large company at his house, three or four days after\nbragged in jest (for there was no such thing), that he had made them eat\nof a baked cat; at which, a young gentlewoman, who had been at the feast,\ntook such a horror, that falling into a violent vomiting and fever, there\nwas no possible means to save her.  Even brute beasts are subject to the\nforce of imagination as well as we; witness dogs, who die of grief for\nthe loss of their masters; and bark and tremble and start in their sleep;\nso horses will kick and whinny in their sleep.\n\nNow all this may be attributed to the close affinity and relation betwixt\nthe soul and the body intercommunicating their fortunes; but \u2018tis quite\nanother thing when the imagination works not only upon one\u2019s own\nparticular body, but upon that of others also.  And as an infected body\ncommunicates its malady to those that approach or live near it, as we see\nin the plague, the smallpox, and sore eyes, that run through whole\nfamilies and cities:--\n\n          \u201cDum spectant oculi laesos, laeduntur et ipsi;\n          Multaque corporibus transitione nocent.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cWhen we look at people with sore eyes, our own eyes become sore.\n     Many things are hurtful to our bodies by transition.\u201d\n      --Ovid, De Rem. Amor., 615.]\n\n--so the imagination, being vehemently agitated, darts out infection\ncapable of offending the foreign object.  The ancients had an opinion of\ncertain women of Scythia, that being animated and enraged against any\none, they killed him only with their looks.  Tortoises and ostriches\nhatch their eggs with only looking on them, which infers that their eyes\nhave in them some ejaculative virtue.  And the eyes of witches are said\nto be assailant and hurtful:--\n\n          \u201cNescio quis teneros oculus mihi fascinat agnos.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cSome eye, I know not whose is bewitching my tender lambs.\u201d\n      --Virgil, Eclog., iii.  103.]\n\nMagicians are no very good authority with me.  But we experimentally see\nthat women impart the marks of their fancy to the children they carry in\nthe womb; witness her that was brought to bed of a Moor; and there was\npresented to Charles the Emperor and King of Bohemia, a girl from about\nPisa, all over rough and covered with hair, whom her mother said to be so\nconceived by reason of a picture of St. John the Baptist, that hung\nwithin the curtains of her bed.\n\nIt is the same with beasts; witness Jacob\u2019s sheep, and the hares and\npartridges that the snow turns white upon the mountains.  There was at my\nhouse, a little while ago, a cat seen watching a bird upon the top of a\ntree: these, for some time, mutually fixing their eyes one upon another,\nthe bird at last let herself fall dead into the cat\u2019s claws, either\ndazzled by the force of its own imagination, or drawn by some attractive\npower of the cat.  Such as are addicted to the pleasures of the field,\nhave, I make no question, heard the story of the falconer, who having\nearnestly fixed his eyes upon a kite in the air; laid a wager that he\nwould bring her down with the sole power of his sight, and did so, as it\nwas said; for the tales I borrow I charge upon the consciences of those\nfrom whom I have them.  The discourses are my own, and found themselves\nupon the proofs of reason, not of experience; to which every one has\nliberty to add his own examples; and who has none, let him not forbear,\nthe number and varieties of accidents considered, to believe that there\nare plenty of them; if I do not apply them well, let some other do it for\nme.  And, also, in the subject of which I treat, our manners and motions,\ntestimonies and instances; how fabulous soever, provided they are\npossible, serve as well as the true; whether they have really happened or\nno, at Rome or Paris, to John or Peter, \u2018tis still within the verge of\nhuman capacity, which serves me to good use.  I see, and make my\nadvantage of it, as well in shadow as in substance; and amongst the\nvarious readings thereof in history, I cull out the most rare and\nmemorable to fit my own turn.  There are authors whose only end and\ndesign it is to give an account of things that have happened; mine, if I\ncould arrive unto it, should be to deliver of what may happen.  There is\na just liberty allowed in the schools, of supposing similitudes, when\nthey have none at hand.  I do not, however, make any use of that\nprivilege, and as to that matter, in superstitious religion, surpass all\nhistorical authority.  In the examples which I here bring in, of what I\nhave heard, read, done, or said, I have forbidden myself to dare to alter\neven the most light and indifferent circumstances; my conscience does not\nfalsify one tittle; what my ignorance may do, I cannot say.\n\nAnd this it is that makes me sometimes doubt in my own mind, whether a\ndivine, or a philosopher, and such men of exact and tender prudence and\nconscience, are fit to write history: for how can they stake their\nreputation upon a popular faith? how be responsible for the opinions of\nmen they do not know? and with what assurance deliver their conjectures\nfor current pay?  Of actions performed before their own eyes, wherein\nseveral persons were actors, they would be unwilling to give evidence\nupon oath before a judge; and there is no man, so familiarly known to\nthem, for whose intentions they would become absolute caution.  For my\npart, I think it less hazardous to write of things past, than present, by\nhow much the writer is only to give an account of things every one knows\nhe must of necessity borrow upon trust.\n\nI am solicited to write the affairs of my own time by some, who fancy I\nlook upon them with an eye less blinded with passion than another, and\nhave a clearer insight into them by reason of the free access fortune has\ngiven me to the heads of various factions; but they do not consider, that\nto purchase the glory of Sallust, I would not give myself the trouble,\nsworn enemy as I am to obligation, assiduity, or perseverance: that there\nis nothing so contrary to my style, as a continued narrative, I so often\ninterrupt and cut myself short in my writing for want of breath; I have\nneither composition nor explanation worth anything, and am ignorant,\nbeyond a child, of the phrases and even the very words proper to express\nthe most common things; and for that reason it is, that I have undertaken\nto say only what I can say, and have accommodated my subject to my\nstrength.  Should I take one to be my guide, peradventure I should not be\nable to keep pace with him; and in the freedom of my liberty might\ndeliver judgments, which upon better thoughts, and according to reason,\nwould be illegitimate and punishable.  Plutarch would say of what he has\ndelivered to us, that it is the work of others: that his examples are all\nand everywhere exactly true: that they are useful to posterity, and are\npresented with a lustre that will light us the way to virtue, is his own\nwork.  It is not of so dangerous consequence, as in a medicinal drug,\nwhether an old story be so or so.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\nTHAT THE PROFIT OF ONE MAN IS THE DAMAGE OF ANOTHER\n\nDemades the Athenian--[Seneca, De Beneficiis, vi. 38, whence nearly the\nwhole of this chapter is taken.]--condemned one of his city, whose trade\nit was to sell the necessaries for funeral ceremonies, upon pretence that\nhe demanded unreasonable profit, and that that profit could not accrue to\nhim, but by the death of a great number of people.  A judgment that\nappears to be ill grounded, forasmuch as no profit whatever can possibly\nbe made but at the expense of another, and that by the same rule he\nshould condemn all gain of what kind soever.  The merchant only thrives\nby the debauchery of youth, the husband man by the dearness of grain, the\narchitect by the ruin of buildings, lawyers and officers of justice by\nthe suits and contentions of men: nay, even the honour and office of\ndivines are derived from our death and vices.  A physician takes no\npleasure in the health even of his friends, says the ancient Greek comic\nwriter, nor a soldier in the peace of his country, and so of the rest.\nAnd, which is yet worse, let every one but dive into his own bosom, and\nhe will find his private wishes spring and his secret hopes grow up at\nanother\u2019s expense.  Upon which consideration it comes into my head, that\nnature does not in this swerve from her general polity; for physicians\nhold, that the birth, nourishment, and increase of every thing is the\ndissolution and corruption of another:\n\n          \u201cNam quodcumque suis mutatum finibus exit,\n          Continuo hoc mors est illius, quod fuit ante.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cFor, whatever from its own confines passes changed, this is at\n     once the death of that which before it was.\u201d--Lucretius, ii. 752.]\n\n\n\n\n     ETEXT EDITOR\u2019S BOOKMARKS:\n\n     Accommodated my subject to my strength\n     Affright people with the very mention of death\n     All I aim at is, to pass my time at my ease\n     All think he has yet twenty good years to come\n     Apprenticeship and a resemblance of death\n     Become a fool by too much wisdom\n     Both himself and his posterity declared ignoble, taxable\n     Caesar: he would be thought an excellent engineer to boot\n     Courtesy and good manners is a very necessary study\n     Dangers do, in truth, little or nothing hasten our end\n     Death can, whenever we please, cut short inconveniences\n     Death has us every moment by the throat\n     Death is a part of you\n     Denying all solicitation, both of hand and mind\n     Did my discourses came only from my mouth or from my heart\n     Die well--that is, patiently and tranquilly.\n     Discover what there is of good and clean in the bottom of the po\n     Downright and sincere obedience\n     Every day travels towards death; the last only arrives at it.\n     Fear is more importunate and insupportable than death itself\n     Fear to lose a thing, which being lost, cannot be lamented?\n     Fear: begets a terrible astonishment and confusion\n     Feared, lest disgrace should make such delinquents desperate\n     Give these young wenches the things they long for\n     Have you ever found any who have been dissatisfied with dying?\n     How many more have died before they arrived at thy age\n     How many several ways has death to surprise us?\n     How much more insupportable and painful an immortal life\n     I have lived longer by this one day than I should have done\n     I take hold of, as little glorious and exemplary as you will\n     If nature do not help a little, it is very hard\n     In this last scene of death, there is no more counterfeiting\n     Inclination to love one another at the first sight\n     Indocile liberty of this member\n     Insensible of the stroke when our youth dies in us\n     Live at the expense of life itself.\n     Much better to offend him once than myself every day\n     Nature, who left us in such a state of imperfection\n     Neither men nor their lives are measured by the ell\n     No man more certain than another of to-morrow.--Seneca\n     No one can be called happy till he is dead and buried\n     Not certain to live till I came home\n     Not melancholic, but meditative\n     Nothing can be a grievance that is but once\n     Philosophy is nothing but to prepare one\u2019s self to die\n     Premeditation of death is the premeditation of liberty\n     Profit made only at the expense of another\n     Rather prating of another man\u2019s province than his own\n     Same folly as to be sorry we were not alive a hundred years ago\n     Slaves, or exiles, ofttimes live as merrily as other folk\n     some people rude, by being overcivil  in their courtesy\n     The day of your birth is one day\u2019s advance towards the grave\n     The deadest deaths are the best\n     The thing in the world I am most afraid of is fear\n     There is no long, nor short, to things that are no more\n     Thing at which we all aim, even in virtue is pleasure\n     Things often appear greater to us at distance than near at hand\n     To study philosophy is nothing but to prepare one\u2019s self to die\n     Utility of living consists not in the length of days\n     Valour has its bounds as well as other virtues\n     Valuing the interest of discipline\n     Well, and what if it had been death itself?\n     What may be done to-morrow, may be done to-day.\n     Who would weigh him without the honour and grandeur of his end.\n     Willingly slip the collar of command upon any pretence whatever\n     Woman who goes to bed to a man, must put off her modesty\n     You must first see us die\n     Young and old die upon the same terms\n\n\n\n\n\n\nESSAYS OF MICHEL DE MONTAIGNE\n\nTranslated by Charles Cotton\n\nEdited by William Carew Hazlitt\n\n1877\n\n\n\n\nCONTENTS OF VOLUME 4.\n\nXXII.     Of custom, and that we should not easily change a law received\nXXIII.    Various events from the same counsel.\nXXIV.     Of pedantry.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\nOF CUSTOM, AND THAT WE SHOULD NOT EASILY CHANGE A LAW RECEIVED\n\nHe seems to me to have had a right and true apprehension of the power of\ncustom, who first invented the story of a country-woman who, having\naccustomed herself to play with and carry a young calf in her arms, and\ndaily continuing to do so as it grew up, obtained this by custom, that,\nwhen grown to be a great ox, she was still able to bear it.  For, in\ntruth, custom is a violent and treacherous schoolmistress.  She, by\nlittle and little, slily and unperceived, slips in the foot of her\nauthority, but having by this gentle and humble beginning, with the\nbenefit of time, fixed and established it, she then unmasks a furious and\ntyrannic countenance, against which we have no more the courage or the\npower so much as to lift up our eyes.  We see her, at every turn, forcing\nand violating the rules of nature:\n\n          \u201cUsus efficacissimus rerum omnium magister.\u201d\n\n          [\u201cCustom is the best master of all things.\u201d\n           --Pliny, Nat.  Hist.,xxvi. 2.]\n\nI refer to her Plato\u2019s cave in his Republic, and the physicians, who so\noften submit the reasons of their art to her authority; as the story of\nthat king, who by custom brought his stomach to that pass, as to live by\npoison, and the maid that Albertus reports to have lived upon spiders.\nIn that new world of the Indies, there were found great nations, and in\nvery differing climates, who were of the same diet, made provision of\nthem, and fed them for their tables; as also, they did grasshoppers,\nmice, lizards, and bats; and in a time of scarcity of such delicacies, a\ntoad was sold for six crowns, all which they cook, and dish up with\nseveral sauces.  There were also others found, to whom our diet, and the\nflesh we eat, were venomous and mortal:\n\n          \u201cConsuetudinis magna vis est: pernoctant venatores in nive:\n          in montibus uri se patiuntur: pugiles, caestibus contusi,\n          ne ingemiscunt quidem.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThe power of custom is very great: huntsmen will lie out all\n     night in the snow, or suffer themselves to be burned up by the sun\n     on the mountains; boxers, hurt by the caestus, never utter a\n     groan.\u201d--Cicero, Tusc., ii. 17]\n\nThese strange examples will not appear so strange if we consider what we\nhave ordinary experience of, how much custom stupefies our senses.  We\nneed not go to what is reported of the people about the cataracts of the\nNile; and what philosophers believe of the music of the spheres, that the\nbodies of those circles being solid and smooth, and coming to touch and\nrub upon one another, cannot fail of creating a marvellous harmony, the\nchanges and cadences of which cause the revolutions and dances of the\nstars; but that the hearing sense of all creatures here below, being\nuniversally, like that of the Egyptians, deafened, and stupefied with the\ncontinual noise, cannot, how great soever, perceive it--[This passage is\ntaken from Cicero, \u201cDream of Scipio\u201d; see his De Republica, vi.  II.  The\nEgyptians were said to be stunned by the noise of the Cataracts.]--\nSmiths, millers, pewterers, forgemen, and armourers could never be able\nto live in the perpetual noise of their own trades, did it strike their\nears with the same violence that it does ours.\n\nMy perfumed doublet gratifies my own scent at first; but after I have\nworn it three days together, \u2018tis only pleasing to the bystanders.  This\nis yet more strange, that custom, notwithstanding long intermissions and\nintervals, should yet have the power to unite and establish the effect of\nits impressions upon our senses, as is manifest in such as live near unto\nsteeples and the frequent noise of the bells.  I myself lie at home in a\ntower, where every morning and evening a very great bell rings out the\nAve Maria: the noise shakes my very tower, and at first seemed\ninsupportable to me; but I am so used to it, that I hear it without any\nmanner of offence, and often without awaking at it.\n\nPlato--[Diogenes Laertius, iii. 38.  But he whom Plato censured was not\na boy playing at nuts, but a man throwing dice.]--reprehending a boy for\nplaying at nuts, \u201cThou reprovest me,\u201d says the boy, \u201cfor a very little\nthing.\u201d  \u201cCustom,\u201d replied Plato, \u201cis no little thing.\u201d  I find that our\ngreatest vices derive their first propensity from our most tender\ninfancy, and that our principal education depends upon the nurse.\nMothers are mightily pleased to see a child writhe off the neck of a\nchicken, or to please itself with hurting a dog or a cat; and such wise\nfathers there are in the world, who look upon it as a notable mark of a\nmartial spirit, when they hear a son miscall, or see him domineer over a\npoor peasant, or a lackey, that dares not reply, nor turn again; and a\ngreat sign of wit, when they see him cheat and overreach his playfellow\nby some malicious treachery and deceit.  Yet these are the true seeds and\nroots of cruelty, tyranny, and treason; they bud and put out there, and\nafterwards shoot up vigorously, and grow to prodigious bulk, cultivated\nby custom.  And it is a very dangerous mistake to excuse these vile\ninclinations upon the tenderness of their age, and the triviality of the\nsubject: first, it is nature that speaks, whose declaration is then more\nsincere, and inward thoughts more undisguised, as it is more weak and\nyoung; secondly, the deformity of cozenage does not consist nor depend\nupon the difference betwixt crowns and pins; but I rather hold it more\njust to conclude thus: why should he not cozen in crowns since he does it\nin pins, than as they do, who say they only play for pins, they would not\ndo it if it were for money?  Children should carefully be instructed to\nabhor vices for their own contexture; and the natural deformity of those\nvices ought so to be represented to them, that they may not only avoid\nthem in their actions, but especially so to abominate them in their\nhearts, that the very thought should be hateful to them, with what mask\nsoever they may be disguised.\n\nI know very well, for what concerns myself, that from having been brought\nup in my childhood to a plain and straightforward way of dealing, and\nfrom having had an aversion to all manner of juggling and foul play in my\nchildish sports and recreations (and, indeed, it is to be noted, that the\nplays of children are not performed in play, but are to be judged in them\nas their most serious actions), there is no game so small wherein from my\nown bosom naturally, and without study or endeavour, I have not an\nextreme aversion from deceit.  I shuffle and cut and make as much clatter\nwith the cards, and keep as strict account for farthings, as it were for\ndouble pistoles; when winning or losing against my wife and daughter,\n\u2018tis indifferent to me, as when I play in good earnest with others, for\nround sums.  At all times, and in all places, my own eyes are sufficient\nto look to my fingers; I am not so narrowly watched by any other, neither\nis there any I have more respect to.\n\nI saw the other day, at my own house, a little fellow, a native of\nNantes, born without arms, who has so well taught his feet to perform the\nservices his hands should have done him, that truly these have half\nforgotten their natural office; and, indeed, the fellow calls them his\nhands; with them he cuts anything, charges and discharges a pistol,\nthreads a needle, sews, writes, puts off his hat, combs his head, plays\nat cards and dice, and all this with as much dexterity as any other could\ndo who had more, and more proper limbs to assist him.  The money I gave\nhim--for he gains his living by shewing these feats--he took in his foot,\nas we do in our hand.  I have seen another who, being yet a boy,\nflourished a two-handed sword, and, if I may so say, handled a halberd\nwith the mere motions of his neck and shoulders for want of hands; tossed\nthem into the air, and caught them again, darted a dagger, and cracked a\nwhip as well as any coachman in France.\n\nBut the effects of custom are much more manifest in the strange\nimpressions she imprints in our minds, where she meets with less\nresistance.  What has she not the power to impose upon our judgments and\nbeliefs?  Is there any so fantastic opinion (omitting the gross\nimpostures of religions, with which we see so many great nations, and so\nmany understanding men, so strangely besotted; for this being beyond the\nreach of human reason, any error is more excusable in such as are not\nendued, through the divine bounty, with an extraordinary illumination\nfrom above), but, of other opinions, are there any so extravagant, that\nshe has not planted and established for laws in those parts of the world\nupon which she has been pleased to exercise her power?  And therefore\nthat ancient exclamation was exceeding just:\n\n       \u201cNon pudet physicum, id est speculatorem venatoremque naturae,\n        ab animis consuetudine imbutis petere testimonium veritatis?\u201d\n\n     [\u201cIs it not a shame for a natural philosopher, that is, for an\n     observer and hunter of nature, to seek testimony of the truth from\n     minds prepossessed by custom?\u201d--Cicero, De Natura Deor., i. 30.]\n\nI do believe, that no so absurd or ridiculous fancy can enter into human\nimagination, that does not meet with some example of public practice, and\nthat, consequently, our reason does not ground and back up.  There are\npeople, amongst whom it is the fashion to turn their backs upon him they\nsalute, and never look upon the man they intend to honour.  There is a\nplace, where, whenever the king spits, the greatest ladies of his court\nput out their hands to receive it; and another nation, where the most\neminent persons about him stoop to take up his ordure in a linen cloth.\nLet us here steal room to insert a story.\n\nA French gentleman was always wont to blow his nose with his fingers (a\nthing very much against our fashion), and he justifying himself for so\ndoing, and he was a man famous for pleasant repartees, he asked me, what\nprivilege this filthy excrement had, that we must carry about us a fine\nhandkerchief to receive it, and, which was more, afterwards to lap it\ncarefully up, and carry it all day about in our pockets, which, he said,\ncould not but be much more nauseous and offensive, than to see it thrown\naway, as we did all other evacuations.  I found that what he said was not\naltogether without reason, and by being frequently in his company, that\nslovenly action of his was at last grown familiar to me; which\nnevertheless we make a face at, when we hear it reported of another\ncountry.  Miracles appear to be so, according to our ignorance of nature,\nand not according to the essence of nature the continually being\naccustomed to anything, blinds the eye of our judgment.  Barbarians are\nno more a wonder to us, than we are to them; nor with any more reason, as\nevery one would confess, if after having travelled over those remote\nexamples, men could settle themselves to reflect upon, and rightly to\nconfer them, with their own.  Human reason is a tincture almost equally\ninfused into all our opinions and manners, of what form soever they are;\ninfinite in matter, infinite in diversity.  But I return to my subject.\n\nThere are peoples, where, his wife and children excepted, no one speaks\nto the king but through a tube.  In one and the same nation, the virgins\ndiscover those parts that modesty should persuade them to hide, and the\nmarried women carefully cover and conceal them.  To which, this custom,\nin another place, has some relation, where chastity, but in marriage, is\nof no esteem, for unmarried women may prostitute themselves to as many as\nthey please, and being got with child, may lawfully take physic, in the\nsight of every one, to destroy their fruit.  And, in another place, if a\ntradesman marry, all of the same condition, who are invited to the\nwedding, lie with the bride before him; and the greater number of them\nthere is, the greater is her honour, and the opinion of her ability and\nstrength: if an officer marry, \u2018tis the same, the same with a labourer,\nor one of mean condition; but then it belongs to the lord of the place to\nperform that office; and yet a severe loyalty during marriage is\nafterward strictly enjoined.  There are places where brothels of young\nmen are kept for the pleasure of women; where the wives go to war as well\nas the husbands, and not only share in the dangers of battle, but,\nmoreover, in the honours of command.  Others, where they wear rings not\nonly through their noses, lips, cheeks, and on their toes, but also\nweighty gimmals of gold thrust through their paps and buttocks; where, in\neating, they wipe their fingers upon their thighs, genitories, and the\nsoles of their feet: where children are excluded, and brothers and\nnephews only inherit; and elsewhere, nephews only, saving in the\nsuccession of the prince: where, for the regulation of community in goods\nand estates, observed in the country, certain sovereign magistrates have\ncommitted to them the universal charge and overseeing of the agriculture,\nand distribution of the fruits, according to the necessity of every one\nwhere they lament the death of children, and feast at the decease of old\nmen: where they lie ten or twelve in a bed, men and their wives together:\nwhere women, whose husbands come to violent ends, may marry again, and\nothers not: where the condition of women is looked upon with such\ncontempt, that they kill all the native females, and buy wives of their\nneighbours to supply their use; where husbands may repudiate their wives,\nwithout showing any cause, but wives cannot part from their husbands, for\nwhat cause soever; where husbands may sell their wives in case of\nsterility; where they boil the bodies of their dead, and afterward pound\nthem to a pulp, which they mix with their wine, and drink it; where the\nmost coveted sepulture is to be eaten by dogs, and elsewhere by birds;\nwhere they believe the souls of the blessed live in all manner of\nliberty, in delightful fields, furnished with all sorts of delicacies,\nand that it is these souls, repeating the words we utter, which we call\nEcho; where they fight in the water, and shoot their arrows with the most\nmortal aim, swimming; where, for a sign of subjection, they lift up their\nshoulders, and hang down their heads; where they put off their shoes when\nthey enter the king\u2019s palace; where the eunuchs, who take charge of the\nsacred women, have, moreover, their lips and noses cut off, that they may\nnot be loved; where the priests put out their own eyes, to be better\nacquainted with their demons, and the better to receive their oracles;\nwhere every one makes to himself a deity of what he likes best; the\nhunter of a lion or a fox, the fisher of some fish; idols of every human\naction or passion; in which place, the sun, the moon, and the earth are\nthe \u2018principal deities, and the form of taking an oath is, to touch the\nearth, looking up to heaven; where both flesh and fish is eaten raw;\nwhere the greatest oath they take is, to swear by the name of some dead\nperson of reputation, laying their hand upon his tomb; where the\nnewyear\u2019s gift the king sends every year to the princes, his vassals, is\nfire, which being brought, all the old fire is put out, and the\nneighbouring people are bound to fetch of the new, every one for\nthemselves, upon pain of high treason; where, when the king, to betake\nhimself wholly to devotion, retires from his administration (which often\nfalls out), his next successor is obliged to do the same, and the right\nof the kingdom devolves to the third in succession: where they vary the\nform of government, according to the seeming necessity of affairs: depose\nthe king when they think good, substituting certain elders to govern in\nhis stead, and sometimes transferring it into the hands of the\ncommonality: where men and women are both circumcised and also baptized:\nwhere the soldier, who in one or several engagements, has been so\nfortunate as to present seven of the enemies\u2019 heads to the king, is made\nnoble: where they live in that rare and unsociable opinion of the\nmortality of the soul: where the women are delivered without pain or\nfear: where the women wear copper leggings upon both legs, and if a louse\nbite them, are bound in magnanimity to bite them again, and dare not\nmarry, till first they have made their king a tender of their virginity,\nif he please to accept it: where the ordinary way of salutation is by\nputting a finger down to the earth, and then pointing it up toward\nheaven: where men carry burdens upon their heads, and women on their\nshoulders; where the women make water standing, and the men squatting:\nwhere they send their blood in token of friendship, and offer incense to\nthe men they would honour, like gods: where, not only to the fourth, but\nin any other remote degree, kindred are not permitted to marry: where the\nchildren are four years at nurse, and often twelve; in which place, also,\nit is accounted mortal to give the child suck the first day after it is\nborn: where the correction of the male children is peculiarly designed to\nthe fathers, and to the mothers of the girls; the punishment being to\nhang them by the heels in the smoke: where they circumcise the women:\nwhere they eat all sorts of herbs, without other scruple than of the\nbadness of the smell: where all things are open the finest houses,\nfurnished in the richest manner, without doors, windows, trunks, or\nchests to lock, a thief being there punished double what they are in\nother places: where they crack lice with their teeth like monkeys, and\nabhor to see them killed with one\u2019s nails: where in all their lives they\nneither cut their hair nor pare their nails; and, in another place, pare\nthose of the right hand only, letting the left grow for ornament and\nbravery: where they suffer the hair on the right side to grow as long as\nit will, and shave the other; and in the neighbouring provinces, some let\ntheir hair grow long before, and some behind, shaving close the rest:\nwhere parents let out their children, and husbands their wives, to their\nguests to hire: where a man may get his own mother with child, and\nfathers make use of their own daughters or sons, without scandal: where,\nat their solemn feasts, they interchangeably lend their children to one\nanother, without any consideration of nearness of blood.  In one place,\nmen feed upon human flesh; in another, \u2018tis reputed a pious office for a\nman to kill his father at a certain age; elsewhere, the fathers dispose\nof their children, whilst yet in their mothers\u2019 wombs, some to be\npreserved and carefully brought up, and others to be abandoned or made\naway.  Elsewhere the old husbands lend their wives to young men; and in\nanother place they are in common without offence; in one place\nparticularly, the women take it for a mark of honour to have as many gay\nfringed tassels at the bottom of their garment, as they have lain with\nseveral men.  Moreover, has not custom made a republic of women\nseparately by themselves? has it not put arms into their hands, and made\nthem raise armies and fight battles?  And does she not, by her own\nprecept, instruct the most ignorant vulgar, and make them perfect in\nthings which all the philosophy in the world could never beat into the\nheads of the wisest men?  For we know entire nations, where death was not\nonly despised, but entertained with the greatest triumph; where children\nof seven years old suffered themselves to be whipped to death, without\nchanging countenance; where riches were in such contempt, that the\nmeanest citizen would not have deigned to stoop to take up a purse of\ncrowns.  And we know regions, very fruitful in all manner of provisions,\nwhere, notwithstanding, the most ordinary diet, and that they are most\npleased with, is only bread, cresses, and water.  Did not custom,\nmoreover, work that miracle in Chios that, in seven hundred years, it was\nnever known that ever maid or wife committed any act to the prejudice of\nher honour?\n\nTo conclude; there is nothing, in my opinion, that she does not, or may\nnot do; and therefore, with very good reason it is that Pindar calls her\nthe ruler of the world.  He that was seen to beat his father, and\nreproved for so doing, made answer, that it was the custom of their\nfamily; that, in like manner, his father had beaten his grandfather, his\ngrandfather his great-grandfather, \u201cAnd this,\u201d says he, pointing to his\nson, \u201cwhen he comes to my age, shall beat me.\u201d  And the father, whom the\nson dragged and hauled along the streets, commanded him to stop at a\ncertain door, for he himself, he said, had dragged his father no farther,\nthat being the utmost limit of the hereditary outrage the sons used to\npractise upon the fathers in their family.  It is as much by custom as\ninfirmity, says Aristotle, that women tear their hair, bite their nails,\nand eat coals and earth, and more by custom than nature that men abuse\nthemselves with one another.\n\nThe laws of conscience, which we pretend to be derived from nature,\nproceed from custom; every one, having an inward veneration for the\nopinions and manners approved and received amongst his own people,\ncannot, without very great reluctance, depart from them, nor apply\nhimself to them without applause.  In times past, when those of Crete\nwould curse any one, they prayed the gods to engage him in some ill\ncustom.  But the principal effect of its power is, so to seize and\nensnare us, that it is hardly in us to disengage ourselves from its\ngripe, or so to come to ourselves, as to consider of and to weigh the\nthings it enjoins.  To say the truth, by reason that we suck it in with\nour milk, and that the face of the world presents itself in this posture\nto our first sight, it seems as if we were born upon condition to follow\non this track; and the common fancies that we find in repute everywhere\nabout us, and infused into our minds with the seed of our fathers, appear\nto be the most universal and genuine; from whence it comes to pass, that\nwhatever is off the hinges of custom, is believed to be also off the\nhinges of reason; how unreasonably for the most part, God knows.\n\nIf, as we who study ourselves have learned to do, every one who hears a\ngood sentence, would immediately consider how it does in any way touch\nhis own private concern, every one would find, that it was not so much a\ngood saying, as a severe lash to the ordinary stupidity of his own\njudgment: but men receive the precepts and admonitions of truth, as\ndirected to the common sort, and never to themselves; and instead of\napplying them to their own manners, do only very ignorantly and\nunprofitably commit them to memory.  But let us return to the empire of\ncustom.\n\nSuch people as have been bred up to liberty, and subject to no other\ndominion but the authority of their own will, look upon all other form of\ngovernment as monstrous and contrary to nature.  Those who are inured to\nmonarchy do the same; and what opportunity soever fortune presents them\nwith to change, even then, when with the greatest difficulties they have\ndisengaged themselves from one master, that was troublesome and grievous\nto them, they presently run, with the same difficulties, to create\nanother; being unable to take into hatred subjection itself.\n\n\u2018Tis by the mediation of custom, that every one is content with the place\nwhere he is planted by nature; and the Highlanders of Scotland no more\npant after Touraine; than the Scythians after Thessaly.  Darius asking\ncertain Greeks what they would take to assume the custom of the Indians,\nof eating the dead bodies of their fathers (for that was their use,\nbelieving they could not give them a better nor more noble sepulture than\nto bury them in their own bodies), they made answer, that nothing in the\nworld should hire them to do it; but having also tried to persuade the\nIndians to leave their custom, and, after the Greek manner, to burn the\nbodies of their fathers, they conceived a still greater horror at the\nmotion.--[Herodotus, iii. 38.]--Every one does the same, for use veils\nfrom us the true aspect of things.\n\n         \u201cNil adeo magnum, nec tam mirabile quidquam\n          Principio, quod non minuant mirarier omnes Paullatim.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThere is nothing at first so grand, so admirable, which by degrees\n     people do not regard with less admiration.\u201d--Lucretius, ii. 1027]\n\nTaking upon me once to justify something in use amongst us, and that was\nreceived with absolute authority for a great many leagues round about us,\nand not content, as men commonly do, to establish it only by force of law\nand example, but inquiring still further into its origin, I found the\nfoundation so weak, that I who made it my business to confirm others, was\nvery near being dissatisfied myself.  \u2018Tis by this receipt that Plato\n--[Laws, viii.  6.]--undertakes to cure the unnatural and preposterous\nloves of his time, as one which he esteems of sovereign virtue, namely,\nthat the public opinion condemns them; that the poets, and all other\nsorts of writers, relate horrible stories of them; a recipe, by virtue of\nwhich the most beautiful daughters no more allure their fathers\u2019 lust;\nnor brothers, of the finest shape and fashion, their sisters\u2019 desire; the\nvery fables of Thyestes, OEdipus, and Macareus, having with the harmony\nof their song, infused this wholesome opinion and belief into the tender\nbrains of children.  Chastity is, in truth, a great and shining virtue,\nand of which the utility is sufficiently known; but to treat of it, and\nto set it off in its true value, according to nature, is as hard as \u2018tis\neasy to do so according to custom, laws, and precepts.  The fundamental\nand universal reasons are of very obscure and difficult research, and our\nmasters either lightly pass them over, or not daring so much as to touch\nthem, precipitate themselves into the liberty and protection of custom,\nthere puffing themselves out and triumphing to their heart\u2019s content:\nsuch as will not suffer themselves to be withdrawn from this original\nsource, do yet commit a greater error, and subject themselves to wild\nopinions; witness Chrysippus,--[Sextus Empiricus, Pyyrhon.  Hypotyp., i.\n14.]--who, in so many of his writings, has strewed the little account he\nmade of incestuous conjunctions, committed with how near relations\nsoever.\n\nWhoever would disengage himself from this violent prejudice of custom,\nwould find several things received with absolute and undoubting opinion,\nthat have no other support than the hoary head and rivelled face of\nancient usage.  But the mask taken off, and things being referred to the\ndecision of truth and reason, he will find his judgment as it were\naltogether overthrown, and yet restored to a much more sure estate.  For\nexample, I shall ask him, what can be more strange than to see a people\nobliged to obey laws they never understood; bound in all their domestic\naffairs, as marriages, donations, wills, sales, and purchases, to rules\nthey cannot possibly know, being neither written nor published in their\nown language, and of which they are of necessity to purchase both the\ninterpretation and the use?  Not according to the ingenious opinion of\nIsocrates,--[Discourse to Nicocles.]--who counselled his king to make\nthe traffics and negotiations of his subjects, free, frank, and of profit\nto them, and their quarrels and disputes burdensome, and laden with heavy\nimpositions and penalties; but, by a prodigious opinion, to make sale of\nreason itself, and to give to laws a course of merchandise.  I think\nmyself obliged to fortune that, as our historians report, it was a Gascon\ngentleman, a countryman of mine, who first opposed Charlemagne, when he\nattempted to impose upon us Latin and imperial laws.\n\nWhat can be more savage, than to see a nation where, by lawful custom,\nthe office of a judge is bought and sold, where judgments are paid for\nwith ready money, and where justice may legitimately be denied to him\nthat has not wherewithal to pay; a merchandise in so great repute, as in\na government to create a fourth estate of wrangling lawyers, to add to\nthe three ancient ones of the church, nobility, and people; which fourth\nestate, having the laws in their own hands, and sovereign power over\nmen\u2019s lives and fortunes, makes another body separate from nobility:\nwhence it comes to pass, that there are double laws, those of honour and\nthose of justice, in many things altogether opposite one to another; the\nnobles as rigorously condemning a lie taken, as the other do a lie\nrevenged: by the law of arms, he shall be degraded from all nobility and\nhonour who puts up with an affront; and by the civil law, he who\nvindicates his reputation by revenge incurs a capital punishment: he who\napplies himself to the law for reparation of an offence done to his\nhonour, disgraces himself; and he who does not, is censured and punished\nby the law.  Yet of these two so different things, both of them referring\nto one head, the one has the charge of peace, the other of war; those\nhave the profit, these the honour; those the wisdom, these the virtue;\nthose the word, these the action; those justice, these valour; those\nreason, these force; those the long robe, these the short;--divided\nbetwixt them.\n\nFor what concerns indifferent things, as clothes, who is there seeking to\nbring them back to their true use, which is the body\u2019s service and\nconvenience, and upon which their original grace and fitness depend; for\nthe most fantastic, in my opinion, that can be imagined, I will instance\namongst others, our flat caps, that long tail of velvet that hangs down\nfrom our women\u2019s heads, with its party-coloured trappings; and that vain\nand futile model of a member we cannot in modesty so much as name, which,\nnevertheless, we make show and parade of in public.  These\nconsiderations, notwithstanding, will not prevail upon any understanding\nman to decline the common mode; but, on the contrary, methinks, all\nsingular and particular fashions are rather marks of folly and vain\naffectation than of sound reason, and that a wise man, within, ought to\nwithdraw and retire his soul from the crowd, and there keep it at liberty\nand in power to judge freely of things; but as to externals, absolutely\nto follow and conform himself to the fashion of the time.  Public society\nhas nothing to do with our thoughts, but the rest, as our actions, our\nlabours, our fortunes, and our lives, we are to lend and abandon them to\nits service and to the common opinion, as did that good and great\nSocrates who refused to preserve his life by a disobedience to the\nmagistrate, though a very wicked and unjust one for it is the rule of\nrules, the general law of laws, that every one observe those of the place\nwherein he lives.\n\n          [\u201cIt is good to obey the laws of one\u2019s country.\u201d\n           --Excerpta ex Trag. Gyaecis, Grotio interp., 1626, p. 937.]\n\nAnd now to another point.  It is a very great doubt, whether any so\nmanifest benefit can accrue from the alteration of a law received, let it\nbe what it will, as there is danger and inconvenience in altering it;\nforasmuch as government is a structure composed of divers parts and\nmembers joined and united together, with so strict connection, that it is\nimpossible to stir so much as one brick or stone, but the whole body will\nbe sensible of it.  The legislator of the Thurians--[Charondas; Diod.\nSic., xii.  24.]--ordained, that whosoever would go about either to\nabolish an old law, or to establish a new, should present himself with a\nhalter about his neck to the people, to the end, that if the innovation\nhe would introduce should not be approved by every one, he might\nimmediately be hanged; and he of the Lacedaemonians employed his life to\nobtain from his citizens a faithful promise that none of his laws should\nbe violated.--[Lycurgus; Plutarch, in Vita, c.  22.]--The Ephoros who so\nrudely cut the two strings that Phrynis had added to music never stood to\nexamine whether that addition made better harmony, or that by its means\nthe instrument was more full and complete; it was enough for him to\ncondemn the invention, that it was a novelty, and an alteration of the\nold fashion.  Which also is the meaning of the old rusty sword carried\nbefore the magistracy of Marseilles.\n\nFor my own part, I have a great aversion from a novelty, what face or\nwhat pretence soever it may carry along with it, and have reason, having\nbeen an eyewitness of the great evils it has produced.  For those which\nfor so many years have lain so heavy upon us, it is not wholly\naccountable; but one may say, with colour enough, that it has\naccidentally produced and begotten the mischiefs and ruin that have since\nhappened, both without and against it; it, principally, we are to accuse\nfor these disorders:\n\n               \u201cHeu! patior telis vulnera facta meis.\u201d\n\n          [\u201cAlas!  The wounds were made by my own weapons.\u201d\n           --Ovid, Ep. Phyll. Demophoonti, vers. 48.]\n\nThey who give the first shock to a state, are almost naturally the first\noverwhelmed in its ruin the fruits of public commotion are seldom enjoyed\nby him who was the first motor; he beats and disturbs the water for\nanother\u2019s net.  The unity and contexture of this monarchy, of this grand\nedifice, having been ripped and torn in her old age, by this thing called\ninnovation, has since laid open a rent, and given sufficient admittance\nto such injuries: the royal majesty with greater difficulty declines from\nthe summit to the middle, then it falls and tumbles headlong from the\nmiddle to the bottom.  But if the inventors do the greater mischief, the\nimitators are more vicious to follow examples of which they have felt and\npunished both the horror and the offence.  And if there can be any degree\nof honour in ill-doing, these last must yield to the others the glory of\ncontriving, and the courage of making the first attempt.  All sorts of\nnew disorders easily draw, from this primitive and ever-flowing fountain,\nexamples and precedents to trouble and discompose our government: we read\nin our very laws, made for the remedy of this first evil, the beginning\nand pretences of all sorts of wicked enterprises; and that befalls us,\nwhich Thucydides said of the civil wars of his time, that, in favour of\npublic vices, they gave them new and more plausible names for their\nexcuse, sweetening and disguising their true titles; which must be done,\nforsooth, to reform our conscience and belief:\n\n                    \u201cHonesta oratio est;\u201d\n\n          [\u201cFine words truly.\u201d--Ter.  And., i. I, 114.]\n\nbut the best pretence for innovation is of very dangerous consequence:\n\n          \u201cAden nihil motum ex antiquo probabile est.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cWe are ever wrong in changing ancient ways.\u201d--Livy, xxxiv. 54]\n\nAnd freely to speak my thoughts, it argues a strange self-love and great\npresumption to be so fond of one\u2019s own opinions, that a public peace must\nbe overthrown to establish them, and to introduce so many inevitable\nmischiefs, and so dreadful a corruption of manners, as a civil war and\nthe mutations of state consequent to it, always bring in their train, and\nto introduce them, in a thing of so high concern, into the bowels of\none\u2019s own country.  Can there be worse husbandry than to set up so many\ncertain and knowing vices against errors that are only contested and\ndisputable?  And are there any worse sorts of vices than those committed\nagainst a man\u2019s own conscience, and the natural light of his own reason?\nThe Senate, upon the dispute betwixt it and the people about the\nadministration of their religion, was bold enough to return this evasion\nfor current pay:\n\n          \u201cAd deos id magis, quam ad se, pertinere: ipsos visuros,\n          ne sacra sua polluantur;\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThose things belong to the gods to determine than to them; let the\n     gods, therefore, take care that their sacred mysteries were not\n     profaned.\u201d--Livy, x. 6.]\n\naccording to what the oracle answered to those of Delphos who, fearing to\nbe invaded by the Persians in the Median war, inquired of Apollo, how\nthey should dispose of the holy treasure of his temple; whether they\nshould hide, or remove it to some other place?  He returned them answer,\nthat they should stir nothing from thence, and only take care of\nthemselves, for he was sufficient to look to what belonged to him.\n--[Herodotus, viii. 36.].--\n\nThe Christian religion has all the marks of the utmost utility and\njustice: but none more manifest than the severe injunction it lays\nindifferently upon all to yield absolute obedience to the civil\nmagistrate, and to maintain and defend the laws.  Of which, what a\nwonderful example has the divine wisdom left us, that, to establish the\nsalvation of mankind, and to conduct His glorious victory over death and\nsin, would do it after no other way, but at the mercy of our ordinary\nforms of justice subjecting the progress and issue of so high and so\nsalutiferous an effect, to the blindness and injustice of our customs\nand observances; sacrificing the innocent blood of so many of His elect,\nand so long a loss of so many years, to the maturing of this inestimable\nfruit?  There is a vast difference betwixt the case of one who follows\nthe forms and laws of his country, and of another who will undertake to\nregulate and change them; of whom the first pleads simplicity, obedience,\nand example for his excuse, who, whatever he shall do, it cannot be\nimputed to malice; \u2018tis at the worst but misfortune:\n\n          \u201cQuis est enim, quem non moveat clarissimis monumentis\n          testata consignataque antiquitas?\u201d\n\n     [\u201cFor who is there that antiquity, attested and confirmed by the\n     fairest monuments, cannot move?\u201d--Cicero, De Divin., i. 40.]\n\nbesides what Isocrates says, that defect is nearer allied to moderation\nthan excess: the other is a much more ruffling gamester; for whosoever\nshall take upon him to choose and alter, usurps the authority of judging,\nand should look well about him, and make it his business to discern\nclearly the defect of what he would abolish, and the virtue of what he is\nabout to introduce.\n\nThis so vulgar consideration is that which settled me in my station, and\nkept even my most extravagant and ungoverned youth under the rein, so as\nnot to burden my shoulders with so great a weight, as to render myself\nresponsible for a science of that importance, and in this to dare, what\nin my better and more mature judgment, I durst not do in the most easy\nand indifferent things I had been instructed in, and wherein the temerity\nof judging is of no consequence at all; it seeming to me very unjust to\ngo about to subject public and established customs and institutions, to\nthe weakness and instability of a private and particular fancy (for\nprivate reason has but a private jurisdiction), and to attempt that upon\nthe divine, which no government will endure a man should do, upon the\ncivil laws; with which, though human reason has much more commerce than\nwith the other, yet are they sovereignly judged by their own proper\njudges, and the extreme sufficiency serves only to expound and set forth\nthe law and custom received, and neither to wrest it, nor to introduce\nanything, of innovation.  If, sometimes, the divine providence has gone\nbeyond the rules to which it has necessarily bound and obliged us men,\nit is not to give us any dispensation to do the same; those are\nmasterstrokes of the divine hand, which we are not to imitate, but to\nadmire, and extraordinary examples, marks of express and particular\npurposes, of the nature of miracles, presented before us for\nmanifestations of its almightiness, equally above both our rules and\nforce, which it would be folly and impiety to attempt to represent and\nimitate; and that we ought not to follow, but to contemplate with the\ngreatest reverence: acts of His personage, and not for us.  Cotta very\nopportunely declares:\n\n     \u201cQuum de religione agitur, Ti. Coruncanium, P. Scipionem,\n     P. Scaevolam, pontifices maximos, non Zenonem, aut Cleanthem,\n     aut Chrysippum, sequor.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cWhen matter of religion is in question, I follow the high priests\n     T. Coruncanius, P. Scipio, P. Scaevola, and not Zeno, Cleanthes, or\n     Chrysippus.\u201d--Cicero, De Natura Deor., iii. 2.]\n\nGod knows, in the present quarrel of our civil war, where there are a\nhundred articles to dash out and to put in, great and very considerable,\nhow many there are who can truly boast, they have exactly and perfectly\nweighed and understood the grounds and reasons of the one and the other\nparty; \u2018tis a number, if they make any number, that would be able to give\nus very little disturbance.  But what becomes of all the rest, under what\nensigns do they march, in what quarter do they lie?  Theirs have the same\neffect with other weak and ill-applied medicines; they have only set the\nhumours they would purge more violently in work, stirred and exasperated\nby the conflict, and left them still behind.  The potion was too weak to\npurge, but strong enough to weaken us; so that it does not work, but we\nkeep it still in our bodies, and reap nothing from the operation but\nintestine gripes and dolours.\n\nSo it is, nevertheless, that Fortune still reserving her authority in\ndefiance of whatever we are able to do or say, sometimes presents us with\na necessity so urgent, that \u2018tis requisite the laws should a little yield\nand give way; and when one opposes the increase of an innovation that\nthus intrudes itself by violence, to keep a man\u2019s self in so doing, in\nall places and in all things within bounds and rules against those who\nhave the power, and to whom all things are lawful that may in any way\nserve to advance their design, who have no other law nor rule but what\nserves best to their own purpose, \u2018tis a dangerous obligation and an\nintolerable inequality:\n\n               \u201cAditum nocendi perfido praestat fides,\u201d\n\n          [\u201cPutting faith in a treacherous person, opens the door to\n          harm.\u201d--Seneca, OEdip., act iii., verse 686.]\n\nforasmuch as the ordinary discipline of a healthful state does not\nprovide against these extraordinary accidents; it presupposes a body that\nsupports itself in its principal members and offices, and a common\nconsent to its obedience and observation.  A legitimate proceeding is\ncold, heavy, and constrained, and not fit to make head against a\nheadstrong and unbridled proceeding.  \u2018Tis known to be to this day cast\nin the dish of those two great men, Octavius and Cato, in the two civil\nwars of Sylla and Caesar, that they would rather suffer their country to\nundergo the last extremities, than relieve their fellow-citizens at the\nexpense of its laws, or be guilty of any innovation; for in truth, in\nthese last necessities, where there is no other remedy, it would,\nperadventure, be more discreetly done, to stoop and yield a little to\nreceive the blow, than, by opposing without possibility of doing good,\nto give occasion to violence to trample all under foot; and better to\nmake the laws do what they can, when they cannot do what they would.\nAfter this manner did he--[Agesilaus.]--who suspended them for\nfour-and-twenty hours, and he who, for once shifted a day in the\ncalendar, and that other--[Alexander the Great.]--who of the month of\nJune made a second of May.  The Lacedaemonians themselves, who were so\nreligious observers of the laws of their country, being straitened by\none of their own edicts, by which it was expressly forbidden to choose\nthe same man twice to be admiral; and on the other side, their affairs\nnecessarily requiring, that Lysander should again take upon him that\ncommand, they made one Aratus admiral; \u2018tis true, but withal, Lysander\nwent general of the navy; and, by the same subtlety, one of their\nambassadors being sent to the Athenians to obtain the revocation of some\ndecree, and Pericles remonstrating to him, that it was forbidden to take\naway the tablet wherein a law had once been engrossed, he advised him to\nturn it only, that being not forbidden; and Plutarch commends\nPhilopoemen, that being born to command, he knew how to do it, not only\naccording to the laws, but also to overrule even the laws themselves,\nwhen the public necessity so required.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\nVARIOUS EVENTS FROM THE SAME COUNSEL\n\nJacques Amiot, grand almoner of France, one day related to me this story,\nmuch to the honour of a prince of ours (and ours he was upon several very\ngood accounts, though originally of foreign extraction),--[The Duc de\nGuise, surnamed Le Balafre.]--that in the time of our first commotions,\nat the siege of Rouen,--[In 1562]--this prince, having been advertised\nby the queen-mother of a conspiracy against his life, and in her letters\nparticular notice being given him of the person who was to execute the\nbusiness (who was a gentleman of Anjou or of Maine, and who to this\neffect ordinarily frequented this prince\u2019s house), discovered not a\nsyllable of this intelligence to any one whatever; but going the next day\nto the St. Catherine\u2019s Mount,--[An eminence outside Rouen overlooking the\nSeine.  D.W.]--from which our battery played against the town (for it\nwas during the time of the siege), and having in company with him the\nsaid lord almoner, and another bishop, he saw this gentleman, who had\nbeen denoted to him, and presently sent for him; to whom, being come\nbefore him, seeing him already pale and trembling with the conscience of\nhis guilt, he thus said, \u201cMonsieur,\u201d such an one, \u201cyou guess what I have\nto say to you; your countenance discovers it; \u2018tis in vain to disguise\nyour practice, for I am so well informed of your business, that it will\nbut make worse for you, to go about to conceal or deny it: you know very\nwell such and such passages\u201d (which were the most secret circumstances of\nhis conspiracy), \u201cand therefore be sure, as you tender your own life,\nto confess to me the whole truth of the design.\u201d  The poor man seeing\nhimself thus trapped and convicted (for the whole business had been\ndiscovered to the queen by one of the accomplices), was in such a taking,\nhe knew not what to do; but, folding his hands, to beg and sue for mercy,\nhe threw himself at his prince\u2019s feet, who taking him up, proceeded to\nsay, \u201cCome, sir; tell me, have I at any time done you offence?  or have\nI, through private hatred or malice, offended any kinsman or friend of\nyours?  It is not above three weeks that I have known you; what\ninducement, then, could move you to attempt my death?\u201d  To which the\ngentleman with a trembling voice replied, \u201cThat it was no particular\ngrudge he had to his person, but the general interest and concern of his\nparty, and that he had been put upon it by some who had persuaded him it\nwould be a meritorious act, by any means, to extirpate so great and so\npowerful an enemy of their religion.\u201d  \u201cWell,\u201d said the prince, \u201cI will\nnow let you see, how much more charitable the religion is that I\nmaintain, than that which you profess: yours has counselled you to kill\nme, without hearing me speak, and without ever having given you any cause\nof offence; and mine commands me to forgive you, convict as you are, by\nyour own confession, of a design to kill me without reason.--[Imitated by\nVoltaire.  See Nodier, Questions, p. 165.]--Get you gone; let me see you\nno more; and, if you are wise, choose henceforward honester men for your\ncounsellors in your designs.\u201d--[Dampmartin, La Fortune de la Coup, liv.\nii., p. 139]\n\nThe Emperor Augustus,--[This story is taken from Seneca, De Clementia,\ni.  9.]--being in Gaul, had certain information of a conspiracy L. Cinna\nwas contriving against him; he therefore resolved to make him an example;\nand, to that end, sent to summon his friends to meet the next morning in\ncounsel.  But the night between he passed in great unquietness of mind,\nconsidering that he was about to put to death a young man, of an\nillustrious family, and nephew to the great Pompey, and this made him\nbreak out into several passionate complainings.  \u201cWhat then,\u201d said he,\n\u201cis it possible that I am to live in perpetual anxiety and alarm, and\nsuffer my would-be assassin, meantime, to walk abroad at liberty?  Shall\nhe go unpunished, after having conspired against my life, a life that I\nhave hitherto defended in so many civil wars, in so many battles by land\nand by sea?  And after having settled the universal peace of the whole\nworld, shall this man be pardoned, who has conspired not only to murder,\nbut to sacrifice me?\u201d--for the conspiracy was to kill him at sacrifice.\nAfter which, remaining for some time silent, he began again, in louder\ntones, and exclaimed against himself, saying:  \u201cWhy livest thou, if it be\nfor the good of so many that thou shouldst die? must there be no end of\nthy revenges and cruelties?  Is thy life of so great value, that so many\nmischiefs must be done to preserve it?\u201d  His wife Livia, seeing him in\nthis perplexity: \u201cWill you take a woman\u2019s counsel?\u201d  said she.  \u201cDo as\nthe physicians do, who, when the ordinary recipes will do no good, make\ntrial of the contrary.  By severity you have hitherto prevailed nothing;\nLepidus has followed Salvidienus; Murena, Lepidus; Caepio, Murena;\nEgnatius, Caepio.  Begin now, and try how sweetness and clemency will\nsucceed.  Cinna is convict; forgive him, he will never henceforth have\nthe heart to hurt thee, and it will be an act to thy glory.\u201d  Augustus\nwas well pleased that he had met with an advocate of his own humour;\nwherefore, having thanked his wife, and, in the morning, countermanded\nhis friends he had before summoned to council, he commanded Cinna all\nalone to be brought to him; who being accordingly come, and a chair by\nhis appointment set him, having ordered all the rest out of the room, he\nspake to him after this manner: \u201cIn the first place, Cinna, I demand of\nthee patient audience; do not interrupt me in what I am about to say, and\nI will afterwards give thee time and leisure to answer.  Thou knowest,\nCinna,--[This passage, borrowed from Seneca, has been paraphrased in\nverse by Corneille.  See Nodier, Questions de la Literature llgale, 1828,\npp. 7, 160.  The monologue of Augustus in this chapter is also from\nSeneca.  Ibid., 164.]--that having taken thee prisoner in the enemy\u2019s\ncamp, and thou an enemy, not only so become, but born so, I gave thee thy\nlife, restored to thee all thy goods, and, finally, put thee in so good a\nposture, by my bounty, of living well and at thy ease, that the\nvictorious envied the conquered. The sacerdotal office which thou madest\nsuit to me for, I conferred upon thee, after having denied it to others,\nwhose fathers have ever borne arms in my service.  After so many\nobligations, thou hast undertaken to kill me.\u201d  At which Cinna crying out\nthat he was very far from entertaining any so wicked a thought: \u201cThou\ndost not keep thy promise, Cinna,\u201d continued Augustus, \u201cthat thou wouldst\nnot interrupt me.  Yes, thou hast undertaken to murder me in such a\nplace, on such a day, in such and such company, and in such a manner.\u201d\n At which words, seeing Cinna astounded and silent, not upon the account\nof his promise so to be, but interdict with the weight of his conscience:\n\u201cWhy,\u201d proceeded Augustus, \u201cto what end wouldst thou do it?  Is it to be\nemperor?  Believe me, the Republic is in very ill condition, if I am the\nonly man betwixt thee and the empire.  Thou art not able so much as to\ndefend thy own house, and but t\u2019other day was baffled in a suit, by the\nopposed interest of a mere manumitted slave.  What, hast thou neither\nmeans nor power in any other thing, but only to undertake Caesar?  I quit\nthe throne, if there be no other than I to obstruct thy hopes.  Canst\nthou believe that Paulus, that Fabius, that the Cossii and the Servilii,\nand so many noble Romans, not only so in title, but who by their virtue\nhonour their nobility, would suffer or endure thee?\u201d  After this, and a\ngreat deal more that he said to him (for he was two long hours in\nspeaking), \u201cNow go, Cinna, go thy way: I give thee that life as traitor\nand parricide, which I before gave thee in the quality of an enemy.  Let\nfriendship from this time forward begin betwixt us, and let us show\nwhether I have given, or thou hast received thy life with the better\nfaith\u201d; and so departed from him.  Some time after, he preferred him to\nthe consular dignity, complaining that he had not the confidence to\ndemand it; had him ever after for his very great friend, and was, at\nlast, made by him sole heir to all his estate.  Now, from the time of\nthis accident which befell Augustus in the fortieth year of his age, he\nnever had any conspiracy or attempt against him, and so reaped the due\nreward of this his so generous clemency.  But it did not so happen with\nour prince, his moderation and mercy not so securing him, but that he\nafterwards fell into the toils of the like treason,--[The Duc de Guise\nwas assassinated in 1563 by Poltrot.]--so vain and futile a thing is\nhuman prudence; throughout all our projects, counsels and precautions,\nFortune will still be mistress of events.\n\nWe repute physicians fortunate when they hit upon a lucky cure, as if\nthere was no other art but theirs that could not stand upon its own legs,\nand whose foundations are too weak to support itself upon its own basis;\nas if no other art stood in need of Fortune\u2019s hand to help it.  For my\npart, I think of physic as much good or ill as any one would have me:\nfor, thanks be to God, we have no traffic together.  I am of a quite\ncontrary humour to other men, for I always despise it; but when I am\nsick, instead of recanting, or entering into composition with it, I\nbegin, moreover, to hate and fear it, telling them who importune me to\ntake physic, that at all events they must give me time to recover my\nstrength and health, that I may be the better able to support and\nencounter the violence and danger of their potions.  I let nature work,\nsupposing her to be sufficiently armed with teeth and claws to defend\nherself from the assaults of infirmity, and to uphold that contexture,\nthe dissolution of which she flies and abhors.  I am afraid, lest,\ninstead of assisting her when close grappled and struggling with disease,\nI should assist her adversary, and burden her still more with work to do.\n\nNow, I say, that not in physic only, but in other more certain arts,\nfortune has a very great part.\n\nThe poetic raptures, the flights of fancy, that ravish and transport the\nauthor out of himself, why should we not attribute them to his good\nfortune, since he himself confesses that they exceed his sufficiency and\nforce, and acknowledges them to proceed from something else than himself,\nand that he has them no more in his power than the orators say they have\nthose extraordinary motions and agitations that sometimes push them\nbeyond their design.  It is the same in painting, where touches shall\nsometimes slip from the hand of the painter, so surpassing both his\nconception and his art, as to beget his own admiration and astonishment.\nBut Fortune does yet more evidently manifest the share she has in all\nthings of this kind, by the graces and elegances we find in them, not\nonly beyond the intention, but even without the knowledge of the workman:\na competent reader often discovers in other men\u2019s writings other\nperfections than the author himself either intended or perceived, a\nricher sense and more quaint expression.\n\nAs to military enterprises, every one sees how great a hand Fortune has\nin them.  Even in our counsels and deliberations there must, certainly,\nbe something of chance and good-luck mixed with human prudence; for all\nthat our wisdom can do alone is no great matter; the more piercing,\nquick, and apprehensive it is, the weaker it finds itself, and is by so\nmuch more apt to mistrust itself.  I am of Sylla\u2019s opinion;--[\u201cWho freed\nhis great deeds from envy by ever attributing them to his good fortune,\nand finally by surnaming himself Faustus, the Lucky.\u201d--Plutarch, How far a\nMan may praise Himself, c. 9.]--and when I closely examine the most\nglorious exploits of war, I perceive, methinks, that those who carry them\non make use of counsel and debate only for custom\u2019s sake, and leave the\nbest part of the enterprise to Fortune, and relying upon her aid,\ntransgress, at every turn, the bounds of military conduct and the rules\nof war.  There happen, sometimes, fortuitous alacrities and strange\nfuries in their deliberations, that for the most part prompt them to\nfollow the worst grounded counsels, and swell their courage beyond the\nlimits of reason.  Whence it happened that several of the great captains\nof old, to justify those rash resolutions, have been fain to tell their\nsoldiers that they were invited to such attempts by some inspiration,\nsome sign and prognostic.\n\nWherefore, in this doubt and uncertainty, that the shortsightedness of\nhuman wisdom to see and choose the best (by reason of the difficulties\nthat the various accidents and circumstances of things bring along with\nthem) perplexes us withal, the surest way, in my opinion, did no other\nconsideration invite us to it, is to pitch upon that wherein is the\ngreatest appearance of honesty and justice; and not, being certain of the\nshortest, to keep the straightest and most direct way; as in the two\nexamples I have just given, there is no question but it was more noble\nand generous in him who had received the offence, to pardon it, than to\ndo otherwise.  If the former--[The Duc de Guise.]--miscarried in it, he\nis not, nevertheless, to be blamed for his good intention; neither does\nany one know if he had proceeded otherwise, whether by that means he had\navoided the end his destiny had appointed for him; and he had, moreover,\nlost the glory of so humane an act.\n\nYou will read in history, of many who have been in such apprehension,\nthat the most part have taken the course to meet and anticipate\nconspiracies against them by punishment and revenge; but I find very few\nwho have reaped any advantage by this proceeding; witness so many Roman\nemperors.  Whoever finds himself in this danger, ought not to expect much\neither from his vigilance or power; for how hard a thing is it for a man\nto secure himself from an enemy, who lies concealed under the countenance\nof the most assiduous friend we have, and to discover and know the wills\nand inward thoughts of those who are in our personal service.  \u2018Tis to\nmuch purpose to have a guard of foreigners about one, and to be always\nfenced about with a pale of armed men; whosoever despises his own life,\nis always master of that of another man.--[Seneca, Ep., 4.]--And\nmoreover, this continual suspicion, that makes a prince jealous of all\nthe world, must of necessity be a strange torment to him.  Therefore it\nwas, that Dion, being advertised that Callippus watched all opportunities\nto take away his life, had never the heart to inquire more particularly\ninto it, saying, that he had rather die than live in that misery, that he\nmust continually stand upon his guard, not only against his enemies, but\nhis friends also;--[Plutarch, Apothegms.]--which Alexander much more\nvividly and more roundly manifested in effect, when, having notice by a\nletter from Parmenio, that Philip, his most beloved physician, was by\nDarius\u2019 money corrupted to poison him, at the same time he gave the\nletter to Philip to read, drank off the potion he had brought him.  Was\nnot this to express a resolution, that if his friends had a mind to\ndespatch him out of the world, he was willing to give them opportunity to\ndo it?  This prince is, indeed, the sovereign pattern of hazardous\nactions; but I do not know whether there be another passage in his life\nwherein there is so much firm courage as in this, nor so illustrious an\nimage of the beauty and greatness of his mind.\n\nThose who preach to princes so circumspect and vigilant a jealousy and\ndistrust, under colour of security, preach to them ruin and dishonour:\nnothing noble can be performed without danger.  I know a person,\nnaturally of a very great daring and enterprising courage, whose good\nfortune is continually marred by such persuasions, that he keep himself\nclose surrounded by his friends, that he must not hearken to any\nreconciliation with his ancient enemies, that he must stand aloof, and\nnot trust his person in hands stronger than his own, what promises or\noffers soever they may make him, or what advantages soever he may see\nbefore him.  And I know another, who has unexpectedly advanced his\nfortunes by following a clear contrary advice.\n\nCourage, the reputation and glory of which men seek with so greedy an\nappetite, presents itself, when need requires, as magnificently in\ncuerpo, as in full armour; in a closet, as in a camp; with arms pendant,\nas with arms raised.\n\nThis over-circumspect and wary prudence is a mortal enemy to all high and\ngenerous exploits.  Scipio, to sound Syphax\u2019s intention, leaving his\narmy, abandoning Spain, not yet secure nor well settled in his new\nconquest, could pass over into Africa in two small ships, to commit\nhimself, in an enemy\u2019s country, to the power of a barbarian king, to a\nfaith untried and unknown, without obligation, without hostage, under the\nsole security of the grandeur of his own courage, his good fortune, and\nthe promise of his high hopes.--[ Livy, xxviii. 17.]\n\n          \u201cHabita fides ipsam plerumque fidem obligat.\u201d\n\n          [\u201cTrust often obliges fidelity.\u201d--Livy, xxii. 22.]\n\nIn a life of ambition and glory, it is necessary to hold a stiff rein\nupon suspicion: fear and distrust invite and draw on offence.  The most\nmistrustful of our kings--[ Louis XI.]--established his affairs\nprincipally by voluntarily committing his life and liberty into his\nenemies\u2019 hands, by that action manifesting that he had absolute\nconfidence in them, to the end they might repose as great an assurance in\nhim.  Caesar only opposed the authority of his countenance and the\nhaughty sharpness of his rebukes to his mutinous legions in arms against\nhim:\n\n                              \u201cStetit aggere fulti\n               Cespitis, intrepidus vultu: meruitque timeri,\n               Nil metuens.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cHe stood on a mound, his countenance intrepid, and merited to be\n     feared, he fearing nothing.\u201d--Lucan, v. 316.]\n\nBut it is true, withal, that this undaunted assurance is not to be\nrepresented in its simple and entire form, but by such whom the\napprehension of death, and the worst that can happen, does not terrify\nand affright; for to represent a pretended resolution with a pale and\ndoubtful countenance and trembling limbs, for the service of an important\nreconciliation, will effect nothing to purpose.  \u2018Tis an excellent way to\ngain the heart and will of another, to submit and intrust one\u2019s self to\nhim, provided it appear to be freely done, and without the constraint of\nnecessity, and in such a condition, that a man manifestly does it out of\na pure and entire confidence in the party, at least, with a countenance\nclear from any cloud of suspicion.  I saw, when I was a boy, a gentleman,\nwho was governor of a great city, upon occasion of a popular commotion\nand fury, not knowing what other course to take, go out of a place of\nvery great strength and security, and commit himself to the mercy of the\nseditious rabble, in hopes by that means to appease the tumult before it\ngrew to a more formidable head; but it was ill for him that he did so,\nfor he was there miserably slain.  But I am not, nevertheless, of\nopinion, that he committed so great an error in going out, as men\ncommonly reproach his memory withal, as he did in choosing a gentle and\nsubmissive way for the effecting his purpose, and in endeavouring to\nquiet this storm, rather by obeying than commanding, and by entreaty\nrather than remonstrance; and I am inclined to believe, that a gracious\nseverity, with a soldierlike way of commanding, full of security and\nconfidence, suitable to the quality of his person, and the dignity of his\ncommand, would have succeeded better with him; at least, he had perished\nwith greater decency and, reputation.  There is nothing so little to be\nexpected or hoped for from this many-headed monster, in its fury, as\nhumanity and good nature; it is much more capable of reverence and fear.\nI should also reproach him, that having taken a resolution (in my\njudgment rather brave than rash) to expose himself, weak and naked, in\nthis tempestuous sea of enraged madmen, he ought to have stuck to his\ntext, and not for an instant to have abandoned the high part he had\nundertaken; whereas, coming to discover his danger nearer hand, and his\nnose happening to bleed, he again changed that demiss and fawning\ncountenance he had at first put on, into another of fear and amazement,\nfilling his voice with entreaties and his eyes with tears, and,\nendeavouring so to withdraw and secure his person, that carriage more\ninflamed their fury, and soon brought the effects of it upon him.\n\nIt was upon a time intended that there should be a general muster of\nseveral troops in arms (and that is the most proper occasion of secret\nrevenges, and there is no place where they can be executed with greater\nsafety), and there were public and manifest appearances, that there was\nno safe coming for some, whose principal and necessary office it was to\nreview them.  Whereupon a consultation was held, and several counsels\nwere proposed, as in a case that was very nice and of great difficulty;\nand moreover of grave consequence.  Mine, amongst the rest, was, that\nthey should by all means avoid giving any sign of suspicion, but that the\nofficers who were most in danger should boldly go, and with cheerful and\nerect countenances ride boldly and confidently through the ranks, and\nthat instead of sparing fire (which the counsels of the major part tended\nto) they should entreat the captains to command the soldiers to give\nround and full volleys in honour of the spectators, and not to spare\ntheir powder.  This was accordingly done, and served so good use, as to\nplease and gratify the suspected troops, and thenceforward to beget a\nmutual and wholesome confidence and intelligence amongst them.\n\nI look upon Julius Caesar\u2019s way of winning men to him as the best and\nfinest that can be put in practice.  First, he tried by clemency to make\nhimself beloved even by his very enemies, contenting himself, in detected\nconspiracies, only publicly to declare, that he was pre-acquainted with\nthem; which being done, he took a noble resolution to await without\nsolicitude or fear, whatever might be the event, wholly resigning himself\nto the protection of the gods and fortune: for, questionless, in this\nstate he was at the time when he was killed.\n\nA stranger having publicly said, that he could teach Dionysius, the\ntyrant of Syracuse, an infallible way to find out and discover all the\nconspiracies his subjects could contrive against him, if he would give\nhim a good sum of money for his pains, Dionysius hearing of it, caused\nthe man to be brought to him, that he might learn an art so necessary to\nhis preservation.  The man made answer, that all the art he knew, was,\nthat he should give him a talent, and afterwards boast that he had\nobtained a singular secret from him.  Dionysius liked the invention, and\naccordingly caused six hundred crowns to be counted out to him.\n--[Plutarch, Apothegms.]--It was not likely he should give so great a\nsum to a person unknown, but upon the account of some extraordinary\ndiscovery, and the belief of this served to keep his enemies in awe.\nPrinces, however, do wisely to publish the informations they receive of\nall the practices against their lives, to possess men with an opinion\nthey have so good intelligence that nothing can be plotted against them,\nbut they have present notice of it.  The Duke of Athens did a great many\nfoolish things in the establishment of his new tyranny over Florence:\nbut this especially was most notable, that having received the first\nintimation of the conspiracies the people were hatching against him, from\nMatteo di Morozzo, one of the conspirators, he presently put him to\ndeath, to suppress that rumour, that it might not be thought any of the\ncity disliked his government.\n\nI remember I have formerly read a story--[In Appian\u2019s Civil Wars, book\niv..]--of some Roman of great quality who, flying the tyranny of the\nTriumvirate, had a thousand times by the subtlety of as many inventions\nescaped from falling into the hands of those that pursued him.  It\nhappened one day that a troop of horse, which was sent out to take him,\npassed close by a brake where he was squat, and missed very narrowly of\nspying him: but he considering, at this point, the pains and difficulties\nwherein he had so long continued to evade the strict and incessant\nsearches that were every day made for him, the little pleasure he could\nhope for in such a kind of life, and how much better it was for him to\ndie once for all, than to be perpetually at this pass, he started from\nhis seat, called them back, showed them his form,--[as of a squatting\nhare.]--and voluntarily delivered himself up to their cruelty, by that\nmeans to free both himself and them from further trouble.  To invite a\nman\u2019s enemies to come and cut his throat, seems a resolution a little\nextravagant and odd; and yet I think he did better to take that course,\nthan to live in continual feverish fear of an accident for which there\nwas no cure.  But seeing all the remedies a man can apply to such a\ndisease, are full of unquietness and uncertainty, \u2018tis better with a\nmanly courage to prepare one\u2019s self for the worst that can happen, and to\nextract some consolation from this, that we are not certain the thing we\nfear will ever come to pass.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV\n\nOF PEDANTRY\n\nI was often, when a boy, wonderfully concerned to see, in the Italian\nfarces, a pedant always brought in for the fool of the play, and that the\ntitle of Magister was in no greater reverence amongst us: for being\ndelivered up to their tuition, what could I do less than be jealous of\ntheir honour and reputation?  I sought indeed to excuse them by the\nnatural incompatibility betwixt the vulgar sort and men of a finer\nthread, both in judgment and knowledge, forasmuch as they go a quite\ncontrary way to one another: but in this, the thing I most stumbled at\nwas, that the finest gentlemen were those who most despised them; witness\nour famous poet Du Bellay--\n\n          \u201cMais je hay par sur tout un scavoir pedantesque.\u201d\n\n          [\u201cOf all things I hate pedantic learning.\u201d--Du Bellay]\n\nAnd \u2018twas so in former times; for Plutarch says that Greek and Scholar\nwere terms of reproach and contempt amongst the Romans.  But since, with\nthe better experience of age, I find they had very great reason so to do,\nand that--\n\n          \u201cMagis magnos clericos non sunt magis magnos sapientes.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThe greatest clerks are not the wisest men.\u201d  A proverb given in\n     Rabelais\u2019 Gargantua, i. 39.]\n\nBut whence it should come to pass, that a mind enriched with the\nknowledge of so many things should not become more quick and sprightly,\nand that a gross and vulgar understanding should lodge within it, without\ncorrecting and improving itself, all the discourses and judgments of the\ngreatest minds the world ever had, I am yet to seek.  To admit so many\nforeign conceptions, so great, and so high fancies, it is necessary (as a\nyoung lady, one of the greatest princesses of the kingdom, said to me\nonce, speaking of a certain person) that a man\u2019s own brain must be\ncrowded and squeezed together into a less compass, to make room for the\nothers; I should be apt to conclude, that as plants are suffocated and\ndrowned with too much nourishment, and lamps with too much oil, so with\ntoo much study and matter is the active part of the understanding which,\nbeing embarrassed, and confounded with a great diversity of things, loses\nthe force and power to disengage itself, and by the pressure of this\nweight, is bowed, subjected, and doubled up.  But it is quite otherwise;\nfor our soul stretches and dilates itself proportionably as it fills; and\nin the examples of elder times, we see, quite contrary, men very proper\nfor public business, great captains, and great statesmen very learned\nwithal.\n\nAnd, as to the philosophers, a sort of men remote from all public\naffairs, they have been sometimes also despised by the comic liberty of\ntheir times; their opinions and manners making them appear, to men of\nanother sort, ridiculous.  Would you make them judges of a lawsuit, of\nthe actions of men? they are ready to take it upon them, and straight\nbegin to examine if there be life, if there be motion, if man be any\nother than an ox;--[\u201cIf Montaigne has copied all this from Plato\u2019s\nTheatetes, p.127, F.  as it is plain by all which he has added\nimmediately after, that he has taken it from that dialogue, he has\ngrossly mistaken Plato\u2019s sentiment, who says here no more than this, that\nthe philosopher is so ignorant of what his neighbour does, that he scarce\nknows whether he is a man, or some other animal:--Coste.\u201d]--what it is to\ndo and to suffer?  what animals law and justice are?  Do they speak of\nthe magistrates, or to him, \u2018tis with a rude, irreverent, and indecent\nliberty.  Do they hear their prince, or a king commended?  they make no\nmore of him, than of a shepherd, goatherd, or neatherd: a lazy Coridon,\noccupied in milking and shearing his herds and flocks, but more rudely\nand harshly than the herd or shepherd himself.  Do you repute any man the\ngreater for being lord of two thousand acres of land? they laugh at such\na pitiful pittance, as laying claim themselves to the whole world for\ntheir possession.  Do you boast of your nobility, as being descended from\nseven rich successive ancestors? they look upon you with an eye of\ncontempt, as men who have not a right idea of the universal image of\nnature, and that do not consider how many predecessors every one of us\nhas had, rich, poor, kings, slaves, Greeks, and barbarians; and though\nyou were the fiftieth descendant from Hercules, they look upon it as a\ngreat vanity, so highly to value this, which is only a gift of fortune.\nAnd \u2018twas so the vulgar sort contemned them, as men ignorant of the most\nelementary and ordinary things; as presumptuous and insolent.\n\nBut this Platonic picture is far different from that these pedants are\npresented by.  Those were envied for raising themselves above the common\nsort, for despising the ordinary actions and offices of life, for having\nassumed a particular and inimitable way of living, and for using a\ncertain method of high-flight and obsolete language, quite different from\nthe ordinary way of speaking: but these are contemned as being as much\nbelow the usual form, as incapable of public employment, as leading a\nlife and conforming themselves to the mean and vile manners of the\nvulgar:\n\n          \u201cOdi ignava opera, philosopha sententia.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cI hate men who jabber about philosophy, but do nothing.\u201d\n      --Pacuvius, ap Gellium, xiii. 8.]\n\n\nFor what concerns the philosophers, as I have said, if they were in\nscience, they were yet much greater in action.  And, as it is said of the\ngeometrician of Syracuse,--[Archimedes.]--who having been disturbed from\nhis contemplation, to put some of his skill in practice for the defence\nof his country, that he suddenly set on foot dreadful and prodigious\nengines, that wrought effects beyond all human expectation; himself,\nnotwithstanding, disdaining all his handiwork, and thinking in this he\nhad played the mere mechanic, and violated the dignity of his art, of\nwhich these performances of his he accounted but trivial experiments and\nplaythings so they, whenever they have been put upon the proof of action,\nhave been seen to fly to so high a pitch, as made it very well appear,\ntheir souls were marvellously elevated, and enriched by the knowledge of\nthings.  But some of them, seeing the reins of government in the hands of\nincapable men, have avoided all management of political affairs; and he\nwho demanded of Crates, how long it was necessary to philosophise,\nreceived this answer: \u201cTill our armies are no more commanded by fools.\u201d\n --[Diogenes Laertius, vi. 92.]--Heraclitus resigned the royalty to his\nbrother; and, to the Ephesians, who reproached him that he spent his time\nin playing with children before the temple: \u201cIs it not better,\u201d said he,\n\u201cto do so, than to sit at the helm of affairs in your company?\u201d  Others\nhaving their imagination advanced above the world and fortune, have\nlooked upon the tribunals of justice, and even the thrones of kings, as\npaltry and contemptible; insomuch, that Empedocles refused the royalty\nthat the Agrigentines offered to him.  Thales, once inveighing in\ndiscourse against the pains and care men put themselves to to become\nrich, was answered by one in the company, that he did like the fox, who\nfound fault with what he could not obtain.  Whereupon, he had a mind, for\nthe jest\u2019s sake, to show them to the contrary; and having, for this\noccasion, made a muster of all his wits, wholly to employ them in the\nservice of profit and gain, he set a traffic on foot, which in one year\nbrought him in so great riches, that the most experienced in that trade\ncould hardly in their whole lives, with all their industry, have raked so\nmuch together.--[Diogenes Laertius, Life of Thales, i.  26; Cicero, De\nDivin., i.  49.]--That which Aristotle reports of some who called both\nhim and Anaxagoras, and others of their profession, wise but not prudent,\nin not applying their study to more profitable things--though I do not\nwell digest this verbal distinction--that will not, however, serve to\nexcuse my pedants, for to see the low and necessitous fortune wherewith\nthey are content, we have rather reason to pronounce that they are\nneither wise nor prudent.\n\nBut letting this first reason alone, I think it better to say, that this\nevil proceeds from their applying themselves the wrong way to the study\nof the sciences; and that, after the manner we are instructed, it is no\nwonder if neither the scholars nor the masters become, though more\nlearned, ever the wiser, or more able.  In plain truth, the cares and\nexpense our parents are at in our education, point at nothing, but to\nfurnish our heads with knowledge; but not a word of judgment and virtue.\nCry out, of one that passes by, to the people: \u201cO, what a learned man!\u201d\n and of another, \u201cO, what a good man!\u201d--[Translated from Seneca, Ep.,\n88.]--they will not fail to turn their eyes, and address their respect\nto the former.  There should then be a third crier, \u201cO, the blockheads!\u201d\n Men are apt presently to inquire, does such a one understand Greek or\nLatin?  Is he a poet?  or does he write in prose?  But whether he be\ngrown better or more discreet, which are qualities of principal concern,\nthese are never thought of.  We should rather examine, who is better\nlearned, than who is more learned.\n\nWe only labour to stuff the memory, and leave the conscience and the\nunderstanding unfurnished and void.  Like birds who fly abroad to forage\nfor grain, and bring it home in the beak, without tasting it themselves,\nto feed their young; so our pedants go picking knowledge here and there,\nout of books, and hold it at the tongue\u2019s end, only to spit it out and\ndistribute it abroad.  And here I cannot but smile to think how I have\npaid myself in showing the foppery of this kind of learning, who myself\nam so manifest an example; for, do I not the same thing throughout almost\nthis whole composition?  I go here and there, culling out of several\nbooks the sentences that best please me, not to keep them (for I have no\nmemory to retain them in), but to transplant them into this; where, to\nsay the truth, they are no more mine than in their first places.  We are,\nI conceive, knowing only in present knowledge, and not at all in what is\npast, or more than is that which is to come.  But the worst on\u2019t is,\ntheir scholars and pupils are no better nourished by this kind of\ninspiration; and it makes no deeper impression upon them, but passes from\nhand to hand, only to make a show to be tolerable company, and to tell\npretty stories, like a counterfeit coin in counters, of no other use or\nvalue, but to reckon with, or to set up at cards:\n\n          \u201cApud alios loqui didicerunt non ipsi secum.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThey have learned to speak from others, not from themselves.\u201d\n      --Cicero, Tusc. Quaes, v. 36.]\n\n               \u201cNon est loquendum, sed gubernandum.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cSpeaking is not so necessary as governing.\u201d--Seneca, Ep., 108.]\n\nNature, to shew that there is nothing barbarous where she has the sole\nconduct, oftentimes, in nations where art has the least to do, causes\nproductions of wit, such as may rival the greatest effect of art\nwhatever.  In relation to what I am now speaking of, the Gascon proverb,\nderived from a cornpipe, is very quaint and subtle:\n\n          \u201cBouha prou bouha, mas a remuda lous dits quem.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cYou may blow till your eyes start out; but if once you offer to\n     stir your fingers, it is all over.\u201d]\n\nWe can say, Cicero says thus; these were the manners of Plato; these are\nthe very words of Aristotle: but what do we say ourselves?  What do we\njudge?  A parrot would say as much as that.\n\nAnd this puts me in mind of that rich gentleman of Rome,--[Calvisius\nSabinus.  Seneca, Ep., 27.]--who had been solicitous, with very great\nexpense, to procure men that were excellent in all sorts of science, whom\nhe had always attending his person, to the end, that when amongst his\nfriends any occasion fell out of speaking of any subject whatsoever, they\nmight supply his place, and be ready to prompt him, one with a sentence\nof Seneca, another with a verse of Homer, and so forth, every one\naccording to his talent; and he fancied this knowledge to be his own,\nbecause it was in the heads of those who lived upon his bounty; as they\nalso do, whose learning consists in having noble libraries.  I know one,\nwho, when I question him what he knows, he presently calls for a book to\nshew me, and dares not venture to tell me so much, as that he has piles\nin his posteriors, till first he has consulted his dictionary, what piles\nand what posteriors are.\n\nWe take other men\u2019s knowledge and opinions upon trust; which is an idle\nand superficial learning. We must make it our own.  We are in this very\nlike him, who having need of fire, went to a neighbour\u2019s house to fetch\nit, and finding a very good one there, sat down to warm himself without\nremembering to carry any with him home.--[Plutarch, How a Man should\nListen.]--What good does it do us to have the stomach full of meat, if\nit do not digest, if it be not incorporated with us, if it does not\nnourish and support us?  Can we imagine that Lucullus, whom letters,\nwithout any manner of experience, made so great a captain, learned to be\nso after this perfunctory manner?--[Cicero, Acad., ii. I.]--We suffer\nourselves to lean and rely so strongly upon the arm of another, that we\ndestroy our own strength and vigour.  Would I fortify myself against the\nfear of death, it must be at the expense of Seneca: would I extract\nconsolation for myself or my friend, I borrow it from Cicero.  I might\nhave found it in myself, had I been trained to make use of my own reason.\nI do not like this relative and mendicant understanding; for though we\ncould become learned by other men\u2019s learning, a man can never be wise but\nby his own wisdom:\n\n     [\u201cI hate the wise man, who in his own concern is not wise.\u201d\n      --Euripides, ap. Cicero, Ep. Fam., xiii. 15.]\n\nWhence Ennius:\n\n     \u201cNequidquam sapere sapientem, qui ipse sibi prodesse non quiret.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThat wise man knows nothing, who cannot profit himself by his\n     wisdom.\u201d--Cicero, De Offic., iii. 15.]\n\n                              \u201cSi cupidus, si\n               Vanus, et Euganea quantumvis mollior agna.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cIf he be grasping, or a boaster, and something softer than an\n     Euganean lamb.\u201d--Juvenal, Sat., viii. 14.]\n\n     \u201cNon enim paranda nobis solum, sed fruenda sapientia est.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cFor wisdom is not only to be acquired, but to be utilised.\u201d\n      --Cicero, De Finib., i. I.]\n\nDionysius--[It was not Dionysius, but Diogenes the cynic.  Diogenes\nLaertius, vi. 27.]--laughed at the grammarians, who set themselves to\ninquire into the miseries of Ulysses, and were ignorant of their own;\nat musicians, who were so exact in tuning their instruments, and never\ntuned their manners; at orators, who made it a study to declare what is\njustice, but never took care to do it.  If the mind be not better\ndisposed, if the judgment be no better settled, I had much rather my\nscholar had spent his time at tennis, for, at least, his body would by\nthat means be in better exercise and breath.  Do but observe him when he\ncomes back from school, after fifteen or sixteen years that he has been\nthere; there is nothing so unfit for employment; all you shall find he\nhas got, is, that his Latin and Greek have only made him a greater\ncoxcomb than when he went from home.  He should bring back his soul\nreplete with good literature, and he brings it only swelled and puffed up\nwith vain and empty shreds and patches of learning; and has really\nnothing more in him than he had before.--[Plato\u2019s Dialogues: Protagoras.]\n\nThese pedants of ours, as Plato says of the Sophists, their\ncousin-germans, are, of all men, they who most pretend to be useful to\nmankind, and who alone, of all men, not only do not better and improve\nthat which is committed to them, as a carpenter or a mason would do, but\nmake them much worse, and make us pay them for making them worse, to\nboot.  If the rule which Protagoras proposed to his pupils were followed\n--either that they should give him his own demand, or make affidavit upon\noath in the temple how much they valued the profit they had received\nunder his tuition, and satisfy him accordingly--my pedagogues would find\nthemselves sorely gravelled, if they were to be judged by the affidavits\nof my experience.  My Perigordin patois very pleasantly calls these\npretenders to learning, \u2018lettre-ferits\u2019, as a man should say,\nletter-marked--men on whom letters have been stamped by the blow of a\nmallet. And, in truth, for the most part, they appear to be deprived even\nof common sense; for you see the husbandman and the cobbler go simply and\nfairly about their business, speaking only of what they know and\nunderstand; whereas these fellows, to make parade and to get opinion,\nmustering this ridiculous knowledge of theirs, that floats on the\nsuperficies of the brain, are perpetually perplexing, and entangling\nthemselves in their own nonsense. They speak fine words sometimes, \u2018tis\ntrue, but let somebody that is wiser apply them.  They are wonderfully\nwell acquainted with Galen, but not at all with the disease of the\npatient; they have already deafened you with a long ribble-row of laws,\nbut understand nothing of the case in hand; they have the theory of all\nthings, let who will put it in practice.\n\nI have sat by, when a friend of mine, in my own house, for sport-sake,\nhas with one of these fellows counterfeited a jargon of Galimatias,\npatched up of phrases without head or tail, saving that he interlarded\nhere and there some terms that had relation to their dispute, and held\nthe coxcomb in play a whole afternoon together, who all the while thought\nhe had answered pertinently and learnedly to all his objections; and yet\nthis was a man of letters, and reputation, and a fine gentleman of the\nlong robe:\n\n         \u201cVos, O patricius sanguis, quos vivere par est\n          Occipiti caeco, posticae occurrite sannae.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cO you, of patrician blood, to whom it is permitted to live\n     with(out) eyes in the back of your head, beware of grimaces at you\n     from behind.\u201d--Persius, Sat., i. 61.]\n\nWhosoever shall narrowly pry into and thoroughly sift this sort of\npeople, wherewith the world is so pestered, will, as I have done, find,\nthat for the most part, they neither understand others, nor themselves;\nand that their memories are full enough, but the judgment totally void\nand empty; some excepted, whose own nature has of itself formed them into\nbetter fashion.  As I have observed, for example, in Adrian Turnebus, who\nhaving never made other profession than that of mere learning only, and\nin that, in my opinion, he was the greatest man that has been these\nthousand years, had nothing at all in him of the pedant, but the wearing\nof his gown, and a little exterior fashion, that could not be civilised\nto courtier ways, which in themselves are nothing.  I hate our people,\nwho can worse endure an ill-contrived robe than an ill-contrived mind,\nand take their measure by the leg a man makes, by his behaviour, and so\nmuch as the very fashion of his boots, what kind of man he is.  For\nwithin there was not a more polished soul upon earth.  I have often\npurposely put him upon arguments quite wide of his profession, wherein I\nfound he had so clear an insight, so quick an apprehension, so solid a\njudgment, that a man would have thought he had never practised any other\nthing but arms, and been all his life employed in affairs of State.\nThese are great and vigorous natures,\n\n                         \u201cQueis arte benigna\n          Et meliore luto finxit praecordia Titan.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cWhom benign Titan (Prometheus) has framed of better clay.\u201d\n      --Juvenal, xiv. 34.]\n\nthat can keep themselves upright in despite of a pedantic education.  But\nit is not enough that our education does not spoil us; it must, moreover,\nalter us for the better.\n\nSome of our Parliaments, when they are to admit officers, examine only\ntheir learning; to which some of the others also add the trial of\nunderstanding, by asking their judgment of some case in law; of these the\nlatter, methinks, proceed with the better method; for although both are\nnecessary, and that it is very requisite they should be defective in\nneither, yet, in truth, knowledge is not so absolutely necessary as\njudgment; the last may make shift without the other, but the other never\nwithout this.  For as the Greek verse says--\n\n     [\u201cTo what use serves learning, if understanding be away.\u201d\n      --Apud Stobaeus, tit. iii., p. 37 (1609).]\n\nWould to God that, for the good of our judicature, these societies were\nas well furnished with understanding and conscience as they are with\nknowledge.\n\n               \u201cNon vita, sed scolae discimus.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cWe do not study for life, but only for the school.\u201d\n      --Seneca, Ep., 106.]\n\nWe are not to tie learning to the soul, but to work and incorporate them\ntogether: not to tincture it only, but to give it a thorough and perfect\ndye; which, if it will not take colour, and meliorate its imperfect\nstate, it were without question better to let it alone.  \u2018Tis a dangerous\nweapon, that will hinder and wound its master, if put into an awkward and\nunskilful hand:\n\n               \u201cUt fuerit melius non didicisse.\u201d\n\n          [\u201cSo that it were better not to have learned.\u201d\n           --Cicero, Tusc. Quaes., ii. 4.]\n\nAnd this, peradventure, is the reason why neither we nor theology require\nmuch learning in women; and that Francis, Duke of Brittany, son of John V.,\none talking with him about his marriage with Isabella the daughter of\nScotland, and adding that she was homely bred, and without any manner of\nlearning, made answer, that he liked her the better, and that a woman was\nwise enough, if she could distinguish her husband\u2019s shirt from his\ndoublet.  So that it is no so great wonder, as they make of it, that our\nancestors had letters in no greater esteem, and that even to this day\nthey are but rarely met with in the principal councils of princes; and if\nthe end and design of acquiring riches, which is the only thing we\npropose to ourselves, by the means of law, physic, pedantry, and even\ndivinity itself, did not uphold and keep them in credit, you would, with\ndoubt, see them in as pitiful a condition as ever.  And what loss would\nthis be, if they neither instruct us to think well nor to do well?\n\n          \u201cPostquam docti prodierunt, boni desunt.\u201d\n\n     [Seneca, Ep., 95.  \u201cSince the \u2018savans\u2019 have made their appearance\n     among us, the good people have become eclipsed.\u201d\n      --Rousseau, Discours sur les Lettres.]\n\nAll other knowledge is hurtful to him who has not the science of\ngoodness.\n\nBut the reason I glanced upon but now, may it not also hence proceed,\nthat, our studies in France having almost no other aim but profit, except\nas to those who, by nature born to offices and employments rather of\nglory than gain, addict themselves to letters, if at all, only for so\nshort a time (being taken from their studies before they can come to have\nany taste of them, to a profession that has nothing to do with books),\nthere ordinarily remain no others to apply themselves wholly to learning,\nbut people of mean condition, who in that only seek the means to live;\nand by such people, whose souls are, both by nature and by domestic\neducation and example, of the basest alloy the fruits of knowledge are\nimmaturely gathered and ill digested, and delivered to their recipients\nquite another thing.  For it is not for knowledge to enlighten a soul\nthat is dark of itself, nor to make a blind man see.  Her business is not\nto find a man\u2019s eyes, but to guide, govern, and direct them, provided he\nhave sound feet and straight legs to go upon.  Knowledge is an excellent\ndrug, but no drug has virtue enough to preserve itself from corruption\nand decay, if the vessel be tainted and impure wherein it is put to keep.\nSuch a one may have a sight clear enough who looks asquint, and\nconsequently sees what is good, but does not follow it, and sees\nknowledge, but makes no use of it.  Plato\u2019s principal institution in his\nRepublic is to fit his citizens with employments suitable to their\nnature.  Nature can do all, and does all.  Cripples are very unfit for\nexercises of the body, and lame souls for exercises of the mind.\nDegenerate and vulgar souls are unworthy of philosophy.  If we see a\nshoemaker with his shoes out at the toes, we say, \u2018tis no wonder; for,\ncommonly, none go worse shod than they.  In like manner, experience often\npresents us a physician worse physicked, a divine less reformed, and\n(constantly) a scholar of less sufficiency, than other people.\n\nOld Aristo of Chios had reason to say that philosophers did their\nauditors harm, forasmuch as most of the souls of those that heard them\nwere not capable of deriving benefit from instruction, which, if not\napplied to good, would certainly be applied to ill:\n\n     [\u201cThey proceeded effeminate debauchees from the school of\n     Aristippus, cynics from that of Zeno.\u201d\n      --Cicero, De Natura Deor., iii., 31.]\n\nIn that excellent institution that Xenophon attributes to the Persians,\nwe find that they taught their children virtue, as other nations do\nletters.  Plato tells us that the eldest son in their royal succession\nwas thus brought up; after his birth he was delivered, not to women, but\nto eunuchs of the greatest authority about their kings for their virtue,\nwhose charge it was to keep his body healthful and in good plight; and\nafter he came to seven years of age, to teach him to ride and to go\na-hunting.  When he arrived at fourteen he was transferred into the hands\nof four, the wisest, the most just, the most temperate, and most valiant\nof the nation; of whom the first was to instruct him in religion, the\nsecond to be always upright and sincere, the third to conquer his\nappetites and desires, and the fourth to despise all danger.\n\nIt is a thing worthy of very great consideration, that in that excellent,\nand, in truth, for its perfection, prodigious form of civil regimen set\ndown by Lycurgus, though so solicitous of the education of children,\nas a thing of the greatest concern, and even in the very seat of the\nMuses, he should make so little mention of learning; as if that generous\nyouth, disdaining all other subjection but that of virtue, ought to be\nsupplied, instead of tutors to read to them arts and sciences, with such\nmasters as should only instruct them in valour, prudence, and justice;\nan example that Plato has followed in his laws.  The manner of their\ndiscipline was to propound to them questions in judgment upon men and\ntheir actions; and if they commended or condemned this or that person or\nfact, they were to give a reason for so doing; by which means they at\nonce sharpened their understanding, and learned what was right.\nAstyages, in Xenophon, asks Cyrus to give an account of his last lesson;\nand thus it was, \u201cA great boy in our school, having a little short\ncassock, by force took a longer from another that was not so tall as he,\nand gave him his own in exchange: whereupon I, being appointed judge of\nthe controversy, gave judgment, that I thought it best each should keep\nthe coat he had, for that they both of them were better fitted with that\nof one another than with their own: upon which my master told me, I had\ndone ill, in that I had only considered the fitness of the garments,\nwhereas I ought to have considered the justice of the thing, which\nrequired that no one should have anything forcibly taken from him that is\nhis own.\u201d  And Cyrus adds that he was whipped for his pains, as we are in\nour villages for forgetting the first aorist of------.\n\n     [Cotton\u2019s version of this story commences differently, and includes\n     a passage which is not in any of the editions of the original before\n     me:\n\n     \u201cMandane, in Xenophon, asking Cyrus how he would do to learn\n     justice, and the other virtues amongst the Medes, having left all\n     his masters behind him in Persia?  He made answer, that he had\n     learned those things long since; that his master had often made him\n     a judge of the differences amongst his schoolfellows, and had one\n     day whipped him for giving a wrong sentence.\u201d--W.C.H.]\n\nMy pedant must make me a very learned oration, \u2018in genere demonstrativo\u2019,\nbefore he can persuade me that his school is like unto that.  They knew\nhow to go the readiest way to work; and seeing that science, when most\nrightly applied and best understood, can do no more but teach us\nprudence, moral honesty, and resolution, they thought fit, at first hand,\nto initiate their children with the knowledge of effects, and to instruct\nthem, not by hearsay and rote, but by the experiment of action, in lively\nforming and moulding them; not only by words and precepts, but chiefly by\nworks and examples; to the end it might not be a knowledge in the mind\nonly, but its complexion and habit: not an acquisition, but a natural\npossession.  One asking to this purpose, Agesilaus, what he thought most\nproper for boys to learn?  \u201cWhat they ought to do when they come to be\nmen,\u201d said he.--[Plutarch, Apothegms of the Lacedamonians.  Rousseau\nadopts the expression in his Diswuys sur tes Lettres.]--It is no wonder,\nif such an institution produced so admirable effects.\n\nThey used to go, it is said, to the other cities of Greece, to inquire\nout rhetoricians, painters, and musicians; but to Lacedaemon for\nlegislators, magistrates, and generals of armies; at Athens they learned\nto speak well: here to do well; there to disengage themselves from a\nsophistical argument, and to unravel the imposture of captious\nsyllogisms; here to evade the baits and allurements of pleasure, and with\na noble courage and resolution to conquer the menaces of fortune and\ndeath; those cudgelled their brains about words, these made it their\nbusiness to inquire into things; there was an eternal babble of the\ntongue, here a continual exercise of the soul.  And therefore it is\nnothing strange if, when Antipater demanded of them fifty children for\nhostages, they made answer, quite contrary to what we should do, that\nthey would rather give him twice as many full-grown men, so much did they\nvalue the loss of their country\u2019s education.  When Agesilaus courted\nXenophon to send his children to Sparta to be bred, \u201cit is not,\u201d said he,\n\u201cthere to learn logic or rhetoric, but to be instructed in the noblest of\nall sciences, namely, the science to obey and to command.\u201d--[Plutarch,\nLife of Agesilaus, c. 7.]\n\nIt is very pleasant to see Socrates, after his manner, rallying Hippias,\n--[Plato\u2019s Dialogues: Hippias Major.]--who recounts to him what a world\nof money he has got, especially in certain little villages of Sicily, by\nteaching school, and that he made never a penny at Sparta: \u201cWhat a\nsottish and stupid people,\u201d said Socrates, \u201care they, without sense or\nunderstanding, that make no account either of grammar or poetry, and only\nbusy themselves in studying the genealogies and successions of their\nkings, the foundations, rises, and declensions of states, and such tales\nof a tub!\u201d  After which, having made Hippias from one step to another\nacknowledge the excellency of their form of public administration, and\nthe felicity and virtue of their private life, he leaves him to guess at\nthe conclusion he makes of the inutilities of his pedantic arts.\n\nExamples have demonstrated to us that in military affairs, and all others\nof the like active nature, the study of sciences more softens and\nuntempers the courages of men than it in any way fortifies and excites\nthem.  The most potent empire that at this day appears to be in the whole\nworld is that of the Turks, a people equally inured to the estimation of\narms and the contempt of letters.  I find Rome was more valiant before\nshe grew so learned.  The most warlike nations at this time in being are\nthe most rude and ignorant: the Scythians, the Parthians, Tamerlane,\nserve for sufficient proof of this.  When the Goths overran Greece, the\nonly thing that preserved all the libraries from the fire was, that some\none possessed them with an opinion that they were to leave this kind of\nfurniture entire to the enemy, as being most proper to divert them from\nthe exercise of arms, and to fix them to a lazy and sedentary life.\nWhen our King Charles VIII., almost without striking a blow, saw himself\npossessed of the kingdom of Naples and a considerable part of Tuscany,\nthe nobles about him attributed this unexpected facility of conquest to\nthis, that the princes and nobles of Italy, more studied to render\nthemselves ingenious and learned, than vigorous and warlike.\n\n\n\n\n     ETEXT EDITOR\u2019S BOOKMARKS:\n\n     A parrot would say as much as that\n     Agesilaus, what he thought most proper for boys to learn?\n     But it is not enough that our education does not spoil us\n     Conscience, which we pretend to be derived from nature\n     Culling out of several books the sentences that best please me\n     \u201cCustom,\u201d replied Plato, \u201cis no little thing\u201d\n      Education\n     Examine, who is better learned, than who is more learned\n     Fear and distrust invite and draw on offence\n     Fortune will still be mistress of events\n     Fox, who found fault with what he could not obtain\n     Fruits of public commotion are seldom enjoyed\n     Gave them new and more plausible names for their excuse\n     Give me time to recover my strength and health\n     Great presumption to be so fond of one\u2019s own opinions\n     Gross impostures of religions\n     Hoary head and rivelled face of ancient usage\n     Hold a stiff rein upon suspicion\n     I have a great aversion from a novelty\n     Knowledge is not so absolutely necessary as judgment\n     Laws do what they can, when they cannot do what they would\n     Man can never be wise but by his own wisdom\n     Memories are full enough, but the judgment totally void\n     Miracles appear to be so, according to our ignorance of nature\n     Nothing noble can be performed without danger\n     Only set the humours they would purge more violently in work\n     Ought not to expect much either from his vigilance or power\n     Ought to withdraw and retire his soul from the crowd\n     Over-circumspect and wary prudence is a mortal enemy\n     Physic\n     Physician worse physicked\n     Plays of children are not performed in play\n     Present himself with a halter about his neck to the people\n     Rome was more valiant before she grew so learned\n     Study to declare what is justice, but never took care to do it.\n     Testimony of the truth from minds prepossessed by custom?\n     They neither instruct us to think well nor to do well\n     Think of physic as much good or ill as any one would have me\n     Use veils from us the true aspect of things\n     Victorious envied the conquered\n     We only labour to stuff the memory\n     We take other men\u2019s knowledge and opinions upon trust\n     Weakness and instability of a private and particular fancy\n     What they ought to do when they come to be men\n     Whosoever despises his own life, is always master\n     Worse endure an ill-contrived robe than an ill-contrived mind\n\n\n\n\n\n\nESSAYS OF MICHEL DE MONTAIGNE\n\nTranslated by Charles Cotton\n\nEdited by William Carew Hazlitt\n\n1877\n\n\n\n\nCONTENTS OF VOLUME 5.\n\nXXV.      Of the education of children.\nXXVI.     That it is folly to measure truth and error by our own\n          capacity.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV\n\nOF THE EDUCATION OF CHILDREN\n\nTO MADAME DIANE DE FOIX, Comtesse de Gurson\n\nI never yet saw that father, but let his son be never so decrepit or\ndeformed, would not, notwithstanding, own him: not, nevertheless, if he\nwere not totally besotted, and blinded with his paternal affection, that\nhe did not well enough discern his defects; but that with all defaults he\nwas still his.  Just so, I see better than any other, that all I write\nhere are but the idle reveries of a man that has only nibbled upon the\noutward crust of sciences in his nonage, and only retained a general and\nformless image of them; who has got a little snatch of everything and\nnothing of the whole, \u2018a la Francoise\u2019.  For I know, in general, that\nthere is such a thing as physic, as jurisprudence: four parts in\nmathematics, and, roughly, what all these aim and point at; and,\nperadventure, I yet know farther, what sciences in general pretend unto,\nin order to the service of our life: but to dive farther than that, and\nto have cudgelled my brains in the study of Aristotle, the monarch of all\nmodern learning, or particularly addicted myself to any one science,\nI have never done it; neither is there any one art of which I am able to\ndraw the first lineaments and dead colour; insomuch that there is not a\nboy of the lowest form in a school, that may not pretend to be wiser than\nI, who am not able to examine him in his first lesson, which, if I am at\nany time forced upon, I am necessitated in my own defence, to ask him,\nunaptly enough, some universal questions, such as may serve to try his\nnatural understanding; a lesson as strange and unknown to him, as his is\nto me.\n\nI never seriously settled myself to the reading any book of solid\nlearning but Plutarch and Seneca; and there, like the Danaides, I\neternally fill, and it as constantly runs out; something of which drops\nupon this paper, but little or nothing stays with me. History is my\nparticular game as to matter of reading, or else poetry, for which I have\nparticular kindness and esteem: for, as Cleanthes said, as the voice,\nforced through the narrow passage of a trumpet, comes out more forcible\nand shrill: so, methinks, a sentence pressed within the harmony of verse\ndarts out more briskly upon the understanding, and strikes my ear and\napprehension with a smarter and more pleasing effect.  As to the natural\nparts I have, of which this is the essay, I find them to bow under the\nburden; my fancy and judgment do but grope in the dark, tripping and\nstumbling in the way; and when I have gone as far as I can, I am in no\ndegree satisfied; I discover still a new and greater extent of land\nbefore me, with a troubled and imperfect sight and wrapped up in clouds,\nthat I am not able to penetrate.  And taking upon me to write\nindifferently of whatever comes into my head, and therein making use of\nnothing but my own proper and natural means, if it befall me, as\noft-times it does, accidentally to meet in any good author, the same heads\nand commonplaces upon which I have attempted to write (as I did but just\nnow in Plutarch\u2019s \u201cDiscourse of the Force of Imagination\u201d), to see myself\nso weak and so forlorn, so heavy and so flat, in comparison of those\nbetter writers, I at once pity or despise myself.  Yet do I please myself\nwith this, that my opinions have often the honour and good fortune to\njump with theirs, and that I go in the same path, though at a very great\ndistance, and can say, \u201cAh, that is so.\u201d  I am farther satisfied to find\nthat I have a quality, which every one is not blessed withal, which is,\nto discern the vast difference between them and me; and notwithstanding\nall that, suffer my own inventions, low and feeble as they are, to run on\nin their career, without mending or plastering up the defects that this\ncomparison has laid open to my own view.  And, in plain truth, a man had\nneed of a good strong back to keep pace with these people.  The\nindiscreet scribblers of our times, who, amongst their laborious\nnothings, insert whole sections and pages out of ancient authors, with a\ndesign, by that means, to illustrate their own writings, do quite\ncontrary; for this infinite dissimilitude of ornaments renders the\ncomplexion of their own compositions so sallow and deformed, that they\nlose much more than they get.\n\nThe philosophers, Chrysippus and Epicurus, were in this of two quite\ncontrary humours: the first not only in his books mixed passages and\nsayings of other authors, but entire pieces, and, in one, the whole Medea\nof Euripides; which gave Apollodorus occasion to say, that should a man\npick out of his writings all that was none of his, he would leave him\nnothing but blank paper: whereas the latter, quite on the contrary, in\nthree hundred volumes that he left behind him, has not so much as one\nquotation.--[Diogenes Laertius, Lives of Chyysippus, vii. 181, and\nEpicurus, x. 26.]\n\nI happened the other day upon this piece of fortune; I was reading a\nFrench book, where after I had a long time run dreaming over a great many\nwords, so dull, so insipid, so void of all wit or common sense, that\nindeed they were only French words: after a long and tedious travel, I\ncame at last to meet with a piece that was lofty, rich, and elevated to\nthe very clouds; of which, had I found either the declivity easy or the\nascent gradual, there had been some excuse; but it was so perpendicular\na precipice, and so wholly cut off from the rest of the work, that by the\nfirst six words, I found myself flying into the other world, and thence\ndiscovered the vale whence I came so deep and low, that I have never had\nsince the heart to descend into it any more.  If I should set out one of\nmy discourses with such rich spoils as these, it would but too evidently\nmanifest the imperfection of my own writing.  To reprehend the fault in\nothers that I am guilty of myself, appears to me no more unreasonable,\nthan to condemn, as I often do, those of others in myself: they are to be\neverywhere reproved, and ought to have no sanctuary allowed them.  I know\nvery well how audaciously I myself, at every turn, attempt to equal\nmyself to my thefts, and to make my style go hand in hand with them, not\nwithout a temerarious hope of deceiving the eyes of my reader from\ndiscerning the difference; but withal it is as much by the benefit of my\napplication, that I hope to do it, as by that of my invention or any\nforce of my own.  Besides, I do not offer to contend with the whole body\nof these champions, nor hand to hand with anyone of them: \u2018tis only by\nflights and little light attempts that I engage them; I do not grapple\nwith them, but try their strength only, and never engage so far as I make\na show to do.  If I could hold them in play, I were a brave fellow; for I\nnever attack them; but where they are most sinewy and strong.  To cover a\nman\u2019s self (as I have seen some do) with another man\u2019s armour, so as not\nto discover so much as his fingers\u2019 ends; to carry on a design (as it is\nnot hard for a man that has anything of a scholar in him, in an ordinary\nsubject to do) under old inventions patched up here and there with his\nown trumpery, and then to endeavour to conceal the theft, and to make it\npass for his own, is first injustice and meanness of spirit in those who\ndo it, who having nothing in them of their own fit to procure them a\nreputation, endeavour to do it by attempting to impose things upon the\nworld in their own name, which they have no manner of title to; and next,\na ridiculous folly to content themselves with acquiring the ignorant\napprobation of the vulgar by such a pitiful cheat, at the price at the\nsame time of degrading themselves in the eyes of men of understanding,\nwho turn up their noses at all this borrowed incrustation, yet whose\npraise alone is worth the having.  For my own part, there is nothing I\nwould not sooner do than that, neither have I said so much of others, but\nto get a better opportunity to explain myself.  Nor in this do I glance\nat the composers of centos, who declare themselves for such; of which\nsort of writers I have in my time known many very ingenious, and\nparticularly one under the name of Capilupus, besides the ancients.\nThese are really men of wit, and that make it appear they are so, both by\nthat and other ways of writing; as for example, Lipsius, in that learned\nand laborious contexture of his Politics.\n\nBut, be it how it will, and how inconsiderable soever these ineptitudes\nmay be, I will say I never intended to conceal them, no more than my old\nbald grizzled likeness before them, where the painter has presented you\nnot with a perfect face, but with mine.  For these are my own particular\nopinions and fancies, and I deliver them as only what I myself believe,\nand not for what is to be believed by others.  I have no other end in\nthis writing, but only to discover myself, who, also shall, peradventure,\nbe another thing to-morrow, if I chance to meet any new instruction to\nchange me.  I have no authority to be believed, neither do I desire it,\nbeing too conscious of my own inerudition to be able to instruct others.\n\nSome one, then, having seen the preceding chapter, the other day told me\nat my house, that I should a little farther have extended my discourse on\nthe education of children.--[\u201cWhich, how fit I am to do, let my friends\nflatter me if they please, I have in the meantime no such opinion of my\nown talent, as to promise myself any very good success from my\nendeavour.\u201d  This passage would appear to be an interpolation by Cotton.\nAt all events, I do not find it in the original editions before me, or in\nCoste.]--\n\nNow, madam, if I had any sufficiency in this subject, I could not\npossibly better employ it, than to present my best instructions to the\nlittle man that threatens you shortly with a happy birth (for you are too\ngenerous to begin otherwise than with a male); for, having had so great a\nhand in the treaty of your marriage, I have a certain particular right\nand interest in the greatness and prosperity of the issue that shall\nspring from it; beside that, your having had the best of my services so\nlong in possession, sufficiently obliges me to desire the honour and\nadvantage of all wherein you shall be concerned.  But, in truth, all I\nunderstand as to that particular is only this, that the greatest and most\nimportant difficulty of human science is the education of children.  For\nas in agriculture, the husbandry that is to precede planting, as also\nplanting itself, is certain, plain, and well known; but after that which\nis planted comes to life, there is a great deal more to be done, more art\nto be used, more care to be taken, and much more difficulty to cultivate\nand bring it to perfection so it is with men; it is no hard matter to get\nchildren; but after they are born, then begins the trouble, solicitude,\nand care rightly to train, principle, and bring them up.  The symptoms of\ntheir inclinations in that tender age are so obscure, and the promises so\nuncertain and fallacious, that it is very hard to establish any solid\njudgment or conjecture upon them.  Look at Cimon, for example, and\nThemistocles, and a thousand others, who very much deceived the\nexpectation men had of them.  Cubs of bears and puppies readily discover\ntheir natural inclination; but men, so soon as ever they are grownup,\napplying themselves to certain habits, engaging themselves in certain\nopinions, and conforming themselves to particular laws and customs,\neasily alter, or at least disguise, their true and real disposition; and\nyet it is hard to force the propension of nature.  Whence it comes to\npass, that for not having chosen the right course, we often take very\ngreat pains, and consume a good part of our time in training up children\nto things, for which, by their natural constitution, they are totally\nunfit.  In this difficulty, nevertheless, I am clearly of opinion, that\nthey ought to be elemented in the best and most advantageous studies,\nwithout taking too much notice of, or being too superstitious in those\nlight prognostics they give of themselves in their tender years, and to\nwhich Plato, in his Republic, gives, methinks, too much authority.\n\nMadam, science is a very great ornament, and a thing of marvellous use,\nespecially in persons raised to that degree of fortune in which you are.\nAnd, in truth, in persons of mean and low condition, it cannot perform\nits true and genuine office, being naturally more prompt to assist in the\nconduct of war, in the government of peoples, in negotiating the leagues\nand friendships of princes and foreign nations, than in forming a\nsyllogism in logic, in pleading a process in law, or in prescribing a\ndose of pills in physic.  Wherefore, madam, believing you will not omit\nthis so necessary feature in the education of your children, who yourself\nhave tasted its sweetness, and are of a learned extraction (for we yet\nhave the writings of the ancient Counts of Foix, from whom my lord, your\nhusband, and yourself, are both of you descended, and Monsieur de\nCandale, your uncle, every day obliges the world with others, which will\nextend the knowledge of this quality in your family for so many\nsucceeding ages), I will, upon this occasion, presume to acquaint your\nladyship with one particular fancy of my own, contrary to the common\nmethod, which is all I am able to contribute to your service in this\naffair.\n\nThe charge of the tutor you shall provide for your son, upon the choice\nof whom depends the whole success of his education, has several other\ngreat and considerable parts and duties required in so important a trust,\nbesides that of which I am about to speak: these, however, I shall not\nmention, as being unable to add anything of moment to the common rules:\nand in this, wherein I take upon me to advise, he may follow it so far\nonly as it shall appear advisable.\n\nFor a, boy of quality then, who pretends to letters not upon the account\nof profit (for so mean an object is unworthy of the grace and favour\nof the Muses, and moreover, in it a man directs his service to and\ndepends upon others), nor so much for outward ornament, as for his own\nproper and peculiar use, and to furnish and enrich himself within, having\nrather a desire to come out an accomplished cavalier than a mere scholar\nor learned man; for such a one, I say, I would, also, have his friends\nsolicitous to find him out a tutor, who has rather a well-made than a\nwell-filled head;--[\u201c\u2018Tete bien faite\u2019, an expression created by\nMontaigne, and which has remained a part of our language.\u201d--Servan.]--\nseeking, indeed, both the one and the other, but rather of the two to\nprefer manners and judgment to mere learning, and that this man should\nexercise his charge after a new method.\n\n\u2018Tis the custom of pedagogues to be eternally thundering in their pupil\u2019s\nears, as they were pouring into a funnel, whilst the business of the\npupil is only to repeat what the others have said: now I would have a\ntutor to correct this error, and, that at the very first, he should\naccording to the capacity he has to deal with, put it to the test,\npermitting his pupil himself to taste things, and of himself to discern\nand choose them, sometimes opening the way to him, and sometimes leaving\nhim to open it for himself; that is, I would not have him alone to invent\nand speak, but that he should also hear his pupil speak in turn.\nSocrates, and since him Arcesilaus, made first their scholars speak, and\nthen they spoke to them--[Diogenes Laertius, iv. 36.]\n\n               \u201cObest plerumque iis, qui discere volunt,\n               auctoritas eorum, qui docent.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThe authority of those who teach, is very often an impediment to\n     those who desire to learn.\u201d--Cicero, De Natura Deor., i. 5.]\n\nIt is good to make him, like a young horse, trot before him, that he may\njudge of his going, and how much he is to abate of his own speed, to\naccommodate himself to the vigour and capacity of the other.  For want of\nwhich due proportion we spoil all; which also to know how to adjust, and\nto keep within an exact and due measure, is one of the hardest things I\nknow, and \u2018tis the effect of a high and well-tempered soul, to know how\nto condescend to such puerile motions and to govern and direct them.\nI walk firmer and more secure up hill than down.\n\nSuch as, according to our common way of teaching, undertake, with one and\nthe same lesson, and the same measure of direction, to instruct several\nboys of differing and unequal capacities, are infinitely mistaken; and\n\u2018tis no wonder, if in a whole multitude of scholars, there are not found\nabove two or three who bring away any good account of their time and\ndiscipline.  Let the master not only examine him about the grammatical\nconstruction of the bare words of his lesson, but about the sense and let\nhim judge of the profit he has made, not by the testimony of his memory,\nbut by that of his life.  Let him make him put what he has learned into a\nhundred several forms, and accommodate it to so many several subjects, to\nsee if he yet rightly comprehends it, and has made it his own, taking\ninstruction of his progress by the pedagogic institutions of Plato.  \u2018Tis\na sign of crudity and indigestion to disgorge what we eat in the same\ncondition it was swallowed; the stomach has not performed its office\nunless it have altered the form and condition of what was committed to it\nto concoct.  Our minds work only upon trust, when bound and compelled to\nfollow the appetite of another\u2019s fancy, enslaved and captivated under the\nauthority of another\u2019s instruction; we have been so subjected to the\ntrammel, that we have no free, nor natural pace of our own; our own\nvigour and liberty are extinct and gone:\n\n                    \u201cNunquam tutelae suae fiunt.\u201d\n\n          [\u201cThey are ever in wardship.\u201d--Seneca, Ep., 33.]\n\nI was privately carried at Pisa to see a very honest man, but so great an\nAristotelian, that his most usual thesis was: \u201cThat the touchstone and\nsquare of all solid imagination, and of all truth, was an absolute\nconformity to Aristotle\u2019s doctrine; and that all besides was nothing but\ninanity and chimera; for that he had seen all, and said all.\u201d A position,\nthat for having been a little too injuriously and broadly interpreted,\nbrought him once and long kept him in great danger of the Inquisition at\nRome.\n\nLet him make him examine and thoroughly sift everything he reads, and\nlodge nothing in his fancy upon simple authority and upon trust.\nAristotle\u2019s principles will then be no more principles to him, than those\nof Epicurus and the Stoics: let this diversity of opinions be propounded\nto, and laid before him; he will himself choose, if he be able; if not,\nhe will remain in doubt.\n\n               \u201cChe non men the saver, dubbiar m\u2019 aggrata.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cI love to doubt, as well as to know.\u201d--Dante, Inferno, xi. 93]\n\nfor, if he embrace the opinions of Xenophon and Plato, by his own reason,\nthey will no more be theirs, but become his own.  Who follows another,\nfollows nothing, finds nothing, nay, is inquisitive after nothing.\n\n          \u201cNon sumus sub rege; sibi quisque se vindicet.\u201d\n\n          [\u201cWe are under no king; let each vindicate himself.\u201d\n           --Seneca, Ep.,33]\n\nLet him, at least, know that he knows.  It will be necessary that he\nimbibe their knowledge, not that he be corrupted with their precepts;\nand no matter if he forget where he had his learning, provided he know\nhow to apply it to his own use.  Truth and reason are common to every\none, and are no more his who spake them first, than his who speaks them\nafter: \u2018tis no more according to Plato, than according to me, since both\nhe and I equally see and understand them.  Bees cull their several sweets\nfrom this flower and that blossom, here and there where they find them,\nbut themselves afterwards make the honey, which is all and purely their\nown, and no more thyme and marjoram: so the several fragments he borrows\nfrom others, he will transform and shuffle together to compile a work\nthat shall be absolutely his own; that is to say, his judgment:\nhis instruction, labour and study, tend to nothing else but to form that.\nHe is not obliged to discover whence he got the materials that have\nassisted him, but only to produce what he has himself done with them.\nMen that live upon pillage and borrowing, expose their purchases and\nbuildings to every one\u2019s view: but do not proclaim how they came by the\nmoney.  We do not see the fees and perquisites of a gentleman of the long\nrobe; but we see the alliances wherewith he fortifies himself and his\nfamily, and the titles and honours he has obtained for him and his.  No\nman divulges his revenue; or, at least, which way it comes in but every\none publishes his acquisitions.  The advantages of our study are to\nbecome better and more wise.  \u2018Tis, says Epicharmus, the understanding\nthat sees and hears, \u2018tis the understanding that improves everything,\nthat orders everything, and that acts, rules, and reigns: all other\nfaculties are blind, and deaf, and without soul.  And certainly we render\nit timorous and servile, in not allowing it the liberty and privilege to\ndo anything of itself.  Whoever asked his pupil what he thought of\ngrammar and rhetoric, or of such and such a sentence of Cicero?  Our\nmasters stick them, full feathered, in our memories, and there establish\nthem like oracles, of which the letters and syllables are of the\nsubstance of the thing.  To know by rote, is no knowledge, and signifies\nno more but only to retain what one has intrusted to our memory.  That\nwhich a man rightly knows and understands, he is the free disposer of at\nhis own full liberty, without any regard to the author from whence he had\nit, or fumbling over the leaves of his book.  A mere bookish learning is\na poor, paltry learning; it may serve for ornament, but there is yet no\nfoundation for any superstructure to be built upon it, according to the\nopinion of Plato, who says, that constancy, faith, and sincerity, are the\ntrue philosophy, and the other sciences, that are directed to other ends;\nmere adulterate paint.  I could wish that Paluel or Pompey, those two\nnoted dancers of my time, could have taught us to cut capers, by only\nseeing them do it, without stirring from our places, as these men pretend\nto inform the understanding without ever setting it to work, or that we\ncould learn to ride, handle a pike, touch a lute, or sing without the\ntrouble of practice, as these attempt to make us judge and speak well,\nwithout exercising us in judging or speaking.  Now in this initiation of\nour studies in their progress, whatsoever presents itself before us is\nbook sufficient; a roguish trick of a page, a sottish mistake of a\nservant, a jest at the table, are so many new subjects.\n\nAnd for this reason, conversation with men is of very great use and\ntravel into foreign countries; not to bring back (as most of our young\nmonsieurs do) an account only of how many paces Santa Rotonda--[The\nPantheon of Agrippa.]--is in circuit; or of the richness of Signora\nLivia\u2019s petticoats; or, as some others, how much Nero\u2019s face, in a statue\nin such an old ruin, is longer and broader than that made for him on some\nmedal; but to be able chiefly to give an account of the humours, manners,\ncustoms, and laws of those nations where he has been, and that we may\nwhet and sharpen our wits by rubbing them against those of others.  I\nwould that a boy should be sent abroad very young, and first, so as to\nkill two birds with one stone, into those neighbouring nations whose\nlanguage is most differing from our own, and to which, if it be not\nformed betimes, the tongue will grow too stiff to bend.\n\nAnd also \u2018tis the general opinion of all, that a child should not be\nbrought up in his mother\u2019s lap.  Mothers are too tender, and their\nnatural affection is apt to make the most discreet of them all so\noverfond, that they can neither find in their hearts to give them due\ncorrection for the faults they may commit, nor suffer them to be inured\nto hardships and hazards, as they ought to be.  They will not endure to\nsee them return all dust and sweat from their exercise, to drink cold\ndrink when they are hot, nor see them mount an unruly horse, nor take a\nfoil in hand against a rude fencer, or so much as to discharge a carbine.\nAnd yet there is no remedy; whoever will breed a boy to be good for\nanything when he comes to be a man, must by no means spare him when\nyoung, and must very often transgress the rules of physic:\n\n              \u201cVitamque sub dio, et trepidis agat\n               In rebus.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cLet him live in open air, and ever in movement about something.\u201d\n      --Horace, Od. ii., 3, 5.]\n\nIt is not enough to fortify his soul; you are also to make his sinews\nstrong; for the soul will be oppressed if not assisted by the members,\nand would have too hard a task to discharge two offices alone.  I know\nvery well to my cost, how much mine groans under the burden, from being\naccommodated with a body so tender and indisposed, as eternally leans and\npresses upon her; and often in my reading perceive that our masters, in\ntheir writings, make examples pass for magnanimity and fortitude of mind,\nwhich really are rather toughness of skin and hardness of bones; for I\nhave seen men, women, and children, naturally born of so hard and\ninsensible a constitution of body, that a sound cudgelling has been less\nto them than a flirt with a finger would have been to me, and that would\nneither cry out, wince, nor shrink, for a good swinging beating; and when\nwrestlers counterfeit the philosophers in patience, \u2018tis rather strength\nof nerves than stoutness of heart.  Now to be inured to undergo labour,\nis to be accustomed to endure pain:\n\n                    \u201cLabor callum obducit dolori.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cLabour hardens us against pain.\u201d--Cicero, Tusc. Quaes., ii. 15.]\n\nA boy is to be broken in to the toil and roughness of exercise, so as to\nbe trained up to the pain and suffering of dislocations, cholics,\ncauteries, and even imprisonment and the rack itself; for he may come by\nmisfortune to be reduced to the worst of these, which (as this world\ngoes) is sometimes inflicted on the good as well as the bad.  As for\nproof, in our present civil war whoever draws his sword against the laws,\nthreatens the honestest men with the whip and the halter.\n\nAnd, moreover, by living at home, the authority of this governor, which\nought to be sovereign over the boy he has received into his charge, is\noften checked and hindered by the presence of parents; to which may also\nbe added, that the respect the whole family pay him, as their master\u2019s\nson, and the knowledge he has of the estate and greatness he is heir to,\nare, in my opinion, no small inconveniences in these tender years.\n\nAnd yet, even in this conversing with men I spoke of but now, I have\nobserved this vice, that instead of gathering observations from others,\nwe make it our whole business to lay ourselves open to them, and are more\nconcerned how to expose and set out our own commodities, than how to\nincrease our stock by acquiring new.  Silence, therefore, and modesty are\nvery advantageous qualities in conversation.  One should, therefore,\ntrain up this boy to be sparing and an husband of his knowledge when he\nhas acquired it; and to forbear taking exceptions at or reproving every\nidle saying or ridiculous story that is said or told in his presence; for\nit is a very unbecoming rudeness to carp at everything that is not\nagreeable to our own palate.  Let him be satisfied with correcting\nhimself, and not seem to condemn everything in another he would not do\nhimself, nor dispute it as against common customs.\n\n               \u201cLicet sapere sine pompa, sine invidia.\u201d\n\n          [\u201cLet us be wise without ostentation, without envy.\u201d\n           --Seneca, Ep., 103.]\n\nLet him avoid these vain and uncivil images of authority, this childish\nambition of coveting to appear better bred and more accomplished, than he\nreally will, by such carriage, discover himself to be.  And, as if\nopportunities of interrupting and reprehending were not to be omitted, to\ndesire thence to derive the reputation of something more than ordinary.\nFor as it becomes none but great poets to make use of the poetical\nlicence, so it is intolerable for any but men of great and illustrious\nsouls to assume privilege above the authority of custom:\n\n     \u201cSi quid Socrates ant Aristippus contra morem et consuetudinem\n     fecerunt, idem sibi ne arbitretur licere: magnis enim illi et\n     divinis bonis hanc licentiam assequebantur.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cIf Socrates and Aristippus have committed any act against manners\n     and custom, let him not think that he is allowed to do the same; for\n     it was by great and divine benefits that they obtained this\n     privilege.\u201d--Cicero, De Offic., i. 41.]\n\nLet him be instructed not to engage in discourse or dispute but with a\nchampion worthy of him, and, even there, not to make use of all the\nlittle subtleties that may seem pat for his purpose, but only such\narguments as may best serve him.  Let him be taught to be curious in the\nelection and choice of his reasons, to abominate impertinence, and\nconsequently, to affect brevity; but, above all, let him be lessoned to\nacquiesce and submit to truth so soon as ever he shall discover it,\nwhether in his opponent\u2019s argument, or upon better consideration of his\nown; for he shall never be preferred to the chair for a mere clatter of\nwords and syllogisms, and is no further engaged to any argument whatever,\nthan as he shall in his own judgment approve it: nor yet is arguing a\ntrade, where the liberty of recantation and getting off upon better\nthoughts, are to be sold for ready money:\n\n          \u201cNeque, ut omnia, qux praescripta et imperata sint,\n          defendat, necessitate ulla cogitur.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cNeither is their any necessity upon him, that he should defend\n     all things that are prescribed and enjoined him.\u201d\n      --Cicero, Acad., ii. 3.]\n\nIf his governor be of my humour, he will form his will to be a very good\nand loyal subject to his prince, very affectionate to his person, and\nvery stout in his quarrel; but withal he will cool in him the desire of\nhaving any other tie to his service than public duty.  Besides several\nother inconveniences that are inconsistent with the liberty every honest\nman ought to have, a man\u2019s judgment, being bribed and prepossessed by\nthese particular obligations, is either blinded and less free to exercise\nits function, or is blemished with ingratitude and indiscretion.  A man\nthat is purely a courtier, can neither have power nor will to speak or\nthink otherwise than favourably and well of a master, who, amongst so\nmany millions of other subjects, has picked out him with his own hand to\nnourish and advance; this favour, and the profit flowing from it, must\nneeds, and not without some show of reason, corrupt his freedom and\ndazzle him; and we commonly see these people speak in another kind of\nphrase than is ordinarily spoken by others of the same nation, though\nwhat they say in that courtly language is not much to be believed.\n\nLet his conscience and virtue be eminently manifest in his speaking, and\nhave only reason for their guide.  Make him understand, that to\nacknowledge the error he shall discover in his own argument, though only\nfound out by himself, is an effect of judgment and sincerity, which are\nthe principal things he is to seek after; that obstinacy and contention\nare common qualities, most appearing in mean souls; that to revise and\ncorrect himself, to forsake an unjust argument in the height and heat of\ndispute, are rare, great, and philosophical qualities.\n\nLet him be advised, being in company, to have his eye and ear in every\ncorner; for I find that the places of greatest honour are commonly seized\nupon by men that have least in them, and that the greatest fortunes are\nseldom accompanied with the ablest parts.  I have been present when,\nwhilst they at the upper end of the chamber have been only commenting the\nbeauty of the arras, or the flavour of the wine, many things that have\nbeen very finely said at the lower end of the table have been lost and\nthrown away.  Let him examine every man\u2019s talent; a peasant, a\nbricklayer, a passenger: one may learn something from every one of these\nin their several capacities, and something will be picked out of their\ndiscourse whereof some use may be made at one time or another; nay, even\nthe folly and impertinence of others will contribute to his instruction.\nBy observing the graces and manners of all he sees, he will create to\nhimself an emulation of the good, and a contempt of the bad.\n\nLet an honest curiosity be suggested to his fancy of being inquisitive\nafter everything; whatever there is singular and rare near the place\nwhere he is, let him go and see it; a fine house, a noble fountain, an\neminent man, the place where a battle has been anciently fought, the\npassages of Caesar and Charlemagne:\n\n              \u201cQux tellus sit lenta gelu, quae putris ab aestu,\n               Ventus in Italiam quis bene vela ferat.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cWhat country is bound in frost, what land is friable with heat,\n     what wind serves fairest for Italy.\u201d--Propertius, iv. 3, 39.]\n\nLet him inquire into the manners, revenues, and alliances of princes,\nthings in themselves very pleasant to learn, and very useful to know.\n\nIn this conversing with men, I mean also, and principally, those who only\nlive in the records of history; he shall, by reading those books,\nconverse with the great and heroic souls of the best ages.  \u2018Tis an idle\nand vain study to those who make it so by doing it after a negligent\nmanner, but to those who do it with care and observation, \u2018tis a study of\ninestimable fruit and value; and the only study, as Plato reports, that\nthe Lacedaemonians reserved to themselves.  What profit shall he not reap\nas to the business of men, by reading the Lives of Plutarch?  But,\nwithal, let my governor remember to what end his instructions are\nprincipally directed, and that he do not so much imprint in his pupil\u2019s\nmemory the date of the ruin of Carthage, as the manners of Hannibal and\nScipio; nor so much where Marcellus died, as why it was unworthy of his\nduty that he died there.  Let him not teach him so much the narrative\nparts of history as to judge them; the reading of them, in my opinion,\nis a thing that of all others we apply ourselves unto with the most\ndiffering measure.  I have read a hundred things in Livy that another has\nnot, or not taken notice of at least; and Plutarch has read a hundred\nmore there than ever I could find, or than, peradventure, that author\never wrote; to some it is merely a grammar study, to others the very\nanatomy of philosophy, by which the most abstruse parts of our human\nnature penetrate.  There are in Plutarch many long discourses very worthy\nto be carefully read and observed, for he is, in my opinion, of all\nothers the greatest master in that kind of writing; but there are a\nthousand others which he has only touched and glanced upon, where he only\npoints with his finger to direct us which way we may go if we will, and\ncontents himself sometimes with giving only one brisk hit in the nicest\narticle of the question, whence we are to grope out the rest.  As, for\nexample, where he says\u2019--[In the Essay on False Shame.]--that the\ninhabitants of Asia came to be vassals to one only, for not having been\nable to pronounce one syllable, which is No.  Which saying of his gave\nperhaps matter and occasion to La Boetie to write his \u201cVoluntary\nServitude.\u201d  Only to see him pick out a light action in a man\u2019s life, or\na mere word that does not seem to amount even to that, is itself a whole\ndiscourse.  \u2018Tis to our prejudice that men of understanding should so\nimmoderately affect brevity; no doubt their reputation is the better by\nit, but in the meantime we are the worse.  Plutarch had rather we should\napplaud his judgment than commend his knowledge, and had rather leave us\nwith an appetite to read more, than glutted with that we have already\nread.  He knew very well, that a man may say too much even upon the best\nsubjects, and that Alexandridas justly reproached him who made very good.\nbut too long speeches to the Ephori, when he said: \u201cO stranger!  thou\nspeakest the things thou shouldst speak, but not as thou shouldst speak\nthem.\u201d--[Plutarch, Apothegms of the Lacedamonians.]--Such as have lean\nand spare bodies stuff themselves out with clothes; so they who are\ndefective in matter endeavour to make amends with words.\n\nHuman understanding is marvellously enlightened by daily conversation\nwith men, for we are, otherwise, compressed and heaped up in ourselves,\nand have our sight limited to the length of our own noses.  One asking\nSocrates of what country he was, he did not make answer, of Athens, but\nof the world;--[Cicero, Tusc. Quaes., v. 37; Plutarch, On Exile, c. 4.]--\nhe whose imagination was fuller and wider, embraced the whole world for\nhis country, and extended his society and friendship to all mankind;\nnot as we do, who look no further than our feet.  When the vines of my\nvillage are nipped with the frost, my parish priest presently concludes,\nthat the indignation of God has gone out against all the human race, and\nthat the cannibals have already got the pip.  Who is it that, seeing the\nhavoc of these civil wars of ours, does not cry out, that the machine of\nthe world is near dissolution, and that the day of judgment is at hand;\nwithout considering, that many worse things have been seen, and that in\nthe meantime, people are very merry in a thousand other parts of the\nearth for all this?  For my part, considering the licence and impunity\nthat always attend such commotions, I wonder they are so moderate, and\nthat there is no more mischief done.  To him who feels the hailstones\npatter about his ears, the whole hemisphere appears to be in storm and\ntempest; like the ridiculous Savoyard, who said very gravely, that if\nthat simple king of France could have managed his fortune as he should\nhave done, he might in time have come to have been steward of the\nhousehold to the duke his master: the fellow could not, in his shallow\nimagination, conceive that there could be anything greater than a Duke of\nSavoy.  And, in truth, we are all of us, insensibly, in this error, an\nerror of a very great weight and very pernicious consequence.  But\nwhoever shall represent to his fancy, as in a picture, that great image\nof our mother nature, in her full majesty and lustre, whoever in her face\nshall read so general and so constant a variety, whoever shall observe\nhimself in that figure, and not himself but a whole kingdom, no bigger\nthan the least touch or prick of a pencil in comparison of the whole,\nthat man alone is able to value things according to their true estimate\nand grandeur.\n\nThis great world which some do yet multiply as several species under one\ngenus, is the mirror wherein we are to behold ourselves, to be able to\nknow ourselves as we ought to do in the true bias.  In short, I would\nhave this to be the book my young gentleman should study with the most\nattention.  So many humours, so many sects, so many judgments, opinions,\nlaws, and customs, teach us to judge aright of our own, and inform our\nunderstanding to discover its imperfection and natural infirmity, which\nis no trivial speculation.  So many mutations of states and kingdoms, and\nso many turns and revolutions of public fortune, will make us wise enough\nto make no great wonder of our own.  So many great names, so many famous\nvictories and conquests drowned and swallowed in oblivion, render our\nhopes ridiculous of eternising our names by the taking of half-a-score of\nlight horse, or a henroost, which only derives its memory from its ruin.\nThe pride and arrogance of so many foreign pomps, the inflated majesty of\nso many courts and grandeurs, accustom and fortify our sight without\nclosing our eyes to behold the lustre of our own; so many trillions of\nmen, buried before us, encourage us not to fear to go seek such good\ncompany in the other world: and so of the rest Pythagoras was want to\nsay,--[Cicero, Tusc. Quaes., v.  3.]--that our life resembles the great\nand populous assembly of the Olympic games, wherein some exercise the\nbody, that they may carry away the glory of the prize: others bring\nmerchandise to sell for profit: there are also some (and those none of\nthe worst sort) who pursue no other advantage than only to look on, and\nconsider how and why everything is done, and to be spectators of the\nlives of other men, thereby the better to judge of and regulate their\nown.\n\nTo examples may fitly be applied all the profitable discourses of\nphilosophy, to which all human actions, as to their best rule, ought to\nbe especially directed: a scholar shall be taught to know--\n\n                    \u201cQuid fas optare: quid asper\n          Utile nummus habet: patrix carisque propinquis\n          Quantum elargiri deceat: quern te Deus esse\n          Jussit, et humana qua parte locatus es in re;\n          Quid sumus, et quidnam victuri gignimur.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cLearn what it is right to wish; what is the true use of coined\n     money; how much it becomes us to give in liberality to our country\n     and our dear relations; whom and what the Deity commanded thee to\n     be; and in what part of the human system thou art placed; what we\n     are ant to what purpose engendered.\u201d--Persius, iii. 69]\n\nwhat it is to know, and what to be ignorant; what ought to be the end and\ndesign of study; what valour, temperance, and justice are; the difference\nbetwixt ambition and avarice, servitude and subjection, licence and\nliberty; by what token a man may know true and solid contentment; how far\ndeath, affliction, and disgrace are to be apprehended;\n\n          \u201cEt quo quemque modo fugiatque feratque laborem.\u201d\n\n          [\u201cAnd how you may shun or sustain every hardship.\u201d\n           --Virgil, AEneid, iii. 459.]\n\nby what secret springs we move, and the reason of our various agitations\nand irresolutions: for, methinks the first doctrine with which one should\nseason his understanding, ought to be that which regulates his manners\nand his sense; that teaches him to know himself, and how both well to dig\nand well to live.  Amongst the liberal sciences, let us begin with that\nwhich makes us free; not that they do not all serve in some measure to\nthe instruction and use of life, as all other things in some sort also\ndo; but let us make choice of that which directly and professedly serves\nto that end.  If we are once able to restrain the offices of human life\nwithin their just and natural limits, we shall find that most of the\nsciences in use are of no great use to us, and even in those that are,\nthat there are many very unnecessary cavities and dilatations which we\nhad better let alone, and, following Socrates\u2019 direction, limit the\ncourse of our studies to those things only where is a true and real\nutility:\n\n                              \u201cSapere aude;\n               Incipe;  Qui recte vivendi prorogat horam,\n               Rusticus exspectat, dum defluat amnis; at ille\n               Labitur, et labetur in omne volubilis oevum.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cDare to be wise; begin! he who defers the hour of living well is\n     like the clown, waiting till the river shall have flowed out: but\n     the river still flows, and will run on, with constant course, to\n     ages without end.\u201d--Horace, Ep., i. 2.]\n\n\u2018Tis a great foolery to teach our children:\n\n              \u201cQuid moveant Pisces, animosaque signa Leonis,\n               Lotus et Hesperia quid Capricornus aqua,\u201d\n\n     [\u201cWhat influence Pisces have, or the sign of angry Leo, or\n     Capricorn, washed by the Hesperian wave.\u201d--Propertius, iv. I, 89.]\n\nthe knowledge of the stars and the motion of the eighth sphere before\ntheir own:\n\n     [\u201cWhat care I about the Pleiades or the stars of Taurus?\u201d\n      --Anacreon, Ode, xvii. 10.]\n\nAnaximenes writing to Pythagoras, \u201cTo what purpose,\u201d said he, \u201cshould I\ntrouble myself in searching out the secrets of the stars, having death or\nslavery continually before my eyes?\u201d for the kings of Persia were at that\ntime preparing to invade his country.  Every one ought to say thus,\n\u201cBeing assaulted, as I am by ambition, avarice, temerity, superstition,\nand having within so many other enemies of life, shall I go ponder over\nthe world\u2019s changes?\u201d\n\nAfter having taught him what will make him more wise and good, you may\nthen entertain him with the elements of logic, physics, geometry,\nrhetoric, and the science which he shall then himself most incline to,\nhis judgment being beforehand formed and fit to choose, he will quickly\nmake his own.  The way of instructing him ought to be sometimes by\ndiscourse, and sometimes by reading; sometimes his governor shall put the\nauthor himself, which he shall think most proper for him, into his hands,\nand sometimes only the marrow and substance of it; and if himself be not\nconversant enough in books to turn to all the fine discourses the books\ncontain for his purpose, there may some man of learning be joined to him,\nthat upon every occasion shall supply him with what he stands in need of,\nto furnish it to his pupil.  And who can doubt but that this way of\nteaching is much more easy and natural than that of Gaza,--[Theodore\nGaza, rector of the Academy of Ferrara.]--in which the precepts are so\nintricate, and so harsh, and the words so vain, lean; and insignificant,\nthat there is no hold to be taken of them, nothing that quickens and\nelevates the wit and fancy, whereas here the mind has what to feed upon\nand to digest.  This fruit, therefore, is not only without comparison,\nmuch more fair and beautiful; but will also be much more early ripe.\n\n\u2018Tis a thousand pities that matters should be at such a pass in this age\nof ours, that philosophy, even with men of understanding, should be,\nlooked upon as a vain and fantastic name, a thing of no use, no value,\neither in opinion or effect, of which I think those ergotisms and petty\nsophistries, by prepossessing the avenues to it, are the cause.  And\npeople are much to blame to represent it to children for a thing of so\ndifficult access, and with such a frowning, grim, and formidable aspect.\nWho is it that has disguised it thus, with this false, pale, and ghostly\ncountenance?  There is nothing more airy, more gay, more frolic, and I\nhad like to have said, more wanton.  She preaches nothing but feasting\nand jollity; a melancholic anxious look shows that she does not inhabit\nthere.  Demetrius the grammarian finding in the temple of Delphos a knot\nof philosophers set chatting together, said to them,--[Plutarch, Treatise\non Oracles which have ceased]--\u201cEither I am much deceived, or by your\ncheerful and pleasant countenances, you are engaged in no, very deep\ndiscourse.\u201d  To which one of them, Heracleon the Megarean, replied:\n\u201cTis for such as are puzzled about inquiring whether the future tense of\nthe verb ------ is spelt with a double A, or that hunt after the\nderivation of the comparatives ----- and -----, and the superlatives ----\nand ------, to knit their brows whilst discoursing of their science: but\nas to philosophical discourses, they always divert and cheer up those\nthat entertain them, and never deject them or make them sad.\u201d\n\n              \u201cDeprendas animi tormenta latentis in aegro\n               Corpore; deprendas et gaudia; sumit utrumque\n               Inde habitum facies.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cYou may discern the torments of mind lurking in a sick body; you\n     may discern its joys: either expression the face assumes from the\n     mind.\u201d--Juvenal, ix. 18]\n\nThe soul that lodges philosophy, ought to be of such a constitution of\nhealth, as to render the body in like manner healthful too; she ought to\nmake her tranquillity and satisfaction shine so as to appear without, and\nher contentment ought to fashion the outward behaviour to her own mould,\nand consequently to fortify it with a graceful confidence, an active and\njoyous carriage, and a serene and contented countenance.  The most\nmanifest sign of wisdom is a continual cheerfulness; her state is like\nthat of things in the regions above the moon, always clear and serene.\n\u2018Tis Baroco and Baralipton--[Two terms of the ancient scholastic\nlogic.]--that render their disciples so dirty and ill-favoured, and not\nshe; they do not so much as know her but by hearsay.  What!  It is she\nthat calms and appeases the storms and tempests of the soul, and who\nteaches famine and fevers to laugh and sing; and that, not by certain\nimaginary epicycles, but by natural and manifest reasons.  She has virtue\nfor her end, which is not, as the schoolmen say, situate upon the summit\nof a perpendicular, rugged, inaccessible precipice: such as have\napproached her find her, quite on the contrary, to be seated in a fair,\nfruitful, and flourishing plain, whence she easily discovers all things\nbelow; to which place any one may, however, arrive, if he know but the\nway, through shady, green, and sweetly-flourishing avenues, by a\npleasant, easy, and smooth descent, like that of the celestial vault.\n\u2018Tis for not having frequented this supreme, this beautiful, triumphant,\nand amiable, this equally delicious and courageous virtue, this so\nprofessed and implacable enemy to anxiety, sorrow, fear, and constraint,\nwho, having nature for her guide, has fortune and pleasure for her\ncompanions, that they have gone, according to their own weak imagination,\nand created this ridiculous, this sorrowful, querulous, despiteful,\nthreatening, terrible image of it to themselves and others, and placed it\nupon a rock apart, amongst thorns and brambles, and made of it a\nhobgoblin to affright people.\n\nBut the governor that I would have, that is such a one as knows it to be\nhis duty to possess his pupil with as much or more affection than\nreverence to virtue, will be able to inform him, that the poets have\nevermore accommodated themselves to the public humour, and make him\nsensible, that the gods have planted more toil and sweat in the avenues\nof the cabinets of Venus than in those of Minerva.  And when he shall\nonce find him begin to apprehend, and shall represent to him a Bradamante\nor an Angelica--[Heroines of Ariosto.]--for a mistress, a natural,\nactive, generous, and not a viragoish, but a manly beauty, in comparison\nof a soft, delicate, artificial simpering, and affected form; the one in\nthe habit of a heroic youth, wearing a glittering helmet, the other\ntricked up in curls and ribbons like a wanton minx; he will then look\nupon his own affection as brave and masculine, when he shall choose quite\ncontrary to that effeminate shepherd of Phrygia.\n\nSuch a tutor will make a pupil digest this new lesson, that the height\nand value of true virtue consists in the facility, utility, and pleasure\nof its exercise; so far from difficulty, that boys, as well as men, and\nthe innocent as well as the subtle, may make it their own; it is by\norder, and not by force, that it is to be acquired.  Socrates, her first\nminion, is so averse to all manner of violence, as totally to throw it\naside, to slip into the more natural facility of her own progress; \u2018tis\nthe nursing mother of all human pleasures, who in rendering them just,\nrenders them also pure and permanent; in moderating them, keeps them in\nbreath and appetite; in interdicting those which she herself refuses,\nwhets our desire to those that she allows; and, like a kind and liberal\nmother, abundantly allows all that nature requires, even to satiety, if\nnot to lassitude: unless we mean to say that the regimen which stops the\ntoper before he has drunk himself drunk, the glutton before he has eaten\nto a surfeit, and the lecher before he has got the pox, is an enemy to\npleasure.  If the ordinary fortune fail, she does without it, and forms\nanother, wholly her own, not so fickle and unsteady as the other.  She\ncan be rich, be potent and wise, and knows how to lie upon soft perfumed\nbeds: she loves life, beauty, glory, and health; but her proper and\npeculiar office is to know how to regulate the use of all these good\nthings, and how to lose them without concern: an office much more noble\nthan troublesome, and without which the whole course of life is\nunnatural, turbulent, and deformed, and there it is indeed, that men may\njustly represent those monsters upon rocks and precipices.\n\nIf this pupil shall happen to be of so contrary a disposition, that he\nhad rather hear a tale of a tub than the true narrative of some noble\nexpedition or some wise and learned discourse; who at the beat of drum,\nthat excites the youthful ardour of his companions, leaves that to follow\nanother that calls to a morris or the bears; who would not wish, and find\nit more delightful and more excellent, to return all dust and sweat\nvictorious from a battle, than from tennis or from a ball, with the prize\nof those exercises; I see no other remedy, but that he be bound prentice\nin some good town to learn to make minced pies, though he were the son of\na duke; according to Plato\u2019s precept, that children are to be placed out\nand disposed of, not according to the wealth, qualities, or condition of\nthe father, but according to the faculties and the capacity of their own\nsouls.\n\nSince philosophy is that which instructs us to live, and that infancy has\nthere its lessons as well as other ages, why is it not communicated to\nchildren betimes?\n\n         \u201cUdum et molle lutum est; nunc, nunc properandus, et acri\n          Fingendus sine fine rota.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThe clay is moist and soft: now, now make haste, and form the\n     pitcher on the rapid wheel.\u201d--Persius, iii. 23.]\n\nThey begin to teach us to live when we have almost done living.\nA hundred students have got the pox before they have come to read\nAristotle\u2019s lecture on temperance.  Cicero said, that though he should\nlive two men\u2019s ages, he should never find leisure to study the lyric\npoets; and I find these sophisters yet more deplorably unprofitable.\nThe boy we would breed has a great deal less time to spare; he owes but\nthe first fifteen or sixteen years of his life to education; the\nremainder is due to action.  Let us, therefore, employ that short time in\nnecessary instruction.  Away with the thorny subtleties of dialectics;\nthey are abuses, things by which our lives can never be amended: take the\nplain philosophical discourses, learn how rightly to choose, and then\nrightly to apply them; they are more easy to be understood than one of\nBoccaccio\u2019s novels; a child from nurse is much more capable of them, than\nof learning to read or to write.  Philosophy has discourses proper for\nchildhood, as well as for the decrepit age of men.\n\nI am of Plutarch\u2019s mind, that Aristotle did not so much trouble his great\ndisciple with the knack of forming syllogisms, or with the elements of\ngeometry; as with infusing into him good precepts concerning valour,\nprowess, magnanimity, temperance, and the contempt of fear; and with this\nammunition, sent him, whilst yet a boy, with no more than thirty thousand\nfoot, four thousand horse, and but forty-two thousand crowns, to\nsubjugate the empire of the whole earth.  For the other acts and\nsciences, he says, Alexander highly indeed commended their excellence and\ncharm, and had them in very great honour and esteem, but not ravished\nwith them to that degree as to be tempted to affect the practice of them\nIn his own person:\n\n              \u201cPetite hinc, juvenesque senesque,\n              Finem ammo certum, miserisque viatica canis.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cYoung men and old men, derive hence a certain end to the mind,\n     and stores for miserable grey hairs.\u201d--Persius, v. 64.]\n\nEpicurus, in the beginning of his letter to Meniceus,--[Diogenes\nLaertius, x. 122.]--says, \u201cThat neither the youngest should refuse to\nphilosophise, nor the oldest grow weary of it.\u201d  Who does otherwise,\nseems tacitly to imply, that either the time of living happily is\nnot yet come, or that it is already past.  And yet, a for all that, I\nwould not have this pupil of ours imprisoned and made a slave to his\nbook; nor would I have him given up to the morosity and melancholic\nhumour of a sour ill-natured pedant.\n\nI would not have his spirit cowed and subdued, by applying him to the\nrack, and tormenting him, as some do, fourteen or fifteen hours a day,\nand so make a pack-horse of him.  Neither should I think it good, when,\nby reason of a solitary and melancholic complexion, he is discovered to\nbe overmuch addicted to his book, to nourish that humour in him; for that\nrenders him unfit for civil conversation, and diverts him from better\nemployments.  And how many have I seen in my time totally brutified by an\nimmoderate thirst after knowledge?  Carneades was so besotted with it,\nthat he would not find time so much as to comb his head or to pare his\nnails.  Neither would I have his generous manners spoiled and corrupted\nby the incivility and barbarism of those of another.  The French wisdom\nwas anciently turned into proverb: \u201cEarly, but of no continuance.\u201d  And,\nin truth, we yet see, that nothing can be more ingenious and pleasing\nthan the children of France; but they ordinarily deceive the hope and\nexpectation that have been conceived of them; and grown up to be men,\nhave nothing extraordinary or worth taking notice of: I have heard men of\ngood understanding say, these colleges of ours to which we send our young\npeople (and of which we have but too many) make them such animals as they\nare.--[Hobbes said that if he Had been at college as long as other people\nhe should have been as great a blockhead as they. W.C.H.] [And Bacon\nbefore Hobbe\u2019s time had discussed the \u201cfutility\u201d of university teaching.\nD.W.]\n\nBut to our little monsieur, a closet, a garden, the table, his bed,\nsolitude, and company, morning and evening, all hours shall be the same,\nand all places to him a study; for philosophy, who, as the formatrix of\njudgment and manners, shall be his principal lesson, has that privilege\nto have a hand in everything.  The orator Isocrates, being at a feast\nentreated to speak of his art, all the company were satisfied with and\ncommended his answer:  \u201cIt is not now a time,\u201d said he, \u201cto do what I can\ndo; and that which it is now time to do, I cannot do.\u201d--[Plutarch,\nSymp., i. I.]--For to make orations and rhetorical disputes in a company\nmet together to laugh and make good cheer, had been very unreasonable and\nimproper, and as much might have been said of all the other sciences.\nBut as to what concerns philosophy, that part of it at least that treats\nof man, and of his offices and duties, it has been the common opinion of\nall wise men, that, out of respect to the sweetness of her conversation,\nshe is ever to be admitted in all sports and entertainments.  And Plato,\nhaving invited her to his feast, we see after how gentle and obliging a\nmanner, accommodated both to time and place, she entertained the company,\nthough in a discourse of the highest and most important nature:\n\n              \u201cAeque pauperibus prodest, locupletibus aeque;\n               Et, neglecta, aeque pueris senibusque nocebit.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cIt profits poor and rich alike, but, neglected, equally hurts old\n     and young.\u201d--Horace, Ep., i. 25.]\n\nBy this method of instruction, my young pupil will be much more and\nbetter employed than his fellows of the college are.  But as the steps we\ntake in walking to and fro in a gallery, though three times as many, do\nnot tire a man so much as those we employ in a formal journey, so our\nlesson, as it were accidentally occurring, without any set obligation of\ntime or place, and falling naturally into every action, will insensibly\ninsinuate itself.  By which means our very exercises and recreations,\nrunning, wrestling, music, dancing, hunting, riding, and fencing, will\nprove to be a good part of our study.  I would have his outward fashion\nand mien, and the disposition of his limbs, formed at the same time with\nhis mind.  \u2018Tis not a soul, \u2018tis not a body that we are training up, but\na man, and we ought not to divide him.  And, as Plato says, we are not to\nfashion one without the other, but make them draw together like two\nhorses harnessed to a coach.  By which saying of his, does he not seem to\nallow more time for, and to take more care of exercises for the body, and\nto hold that the mind, in a good proportion, does her business at the\nsame time too?\n\nAs to the rest, this method of education ought to be carried on with a\nsevere sweetness, quite contrary to the practice of our pedants, who,\ninstead of tempting and alluring children to letters by apt and gentle\nways, do in truth present nothing before them but rods and ferules,\nhorror and cruelty.  Away with this violence!  away with this compulsion!\nthan which, I certainly believe nothing more dulls and degenerates a\nwell-descended nature.  If you would have him apprehend shame and\nchastisement, do not harden him to them: inure him to heat and cold, to\nwind and sun, and to dangers that he ought to despise; wean him from all\neffeminacy and delicacy in clothes and lodging, eating and drinking;\naccustom him to everything, that he may not be a Sir Paris,\na carpet-knight, but a sinewy, hardy, and vigorous young man.  I have\never from a child to the age wherein I now am, been of this opinion, and\nam still constant to it.  But amongst other things, the strict\ngovernment of most of our colleges has evermore displeased me;\nperadventure, they might have erred less perniciously on the indulgent\nside.  \u2018Tis a real house of correction of imprisoned youth.  They are\nmade debauched by being punished before they are so.  Do but come in\nwhen they are about their lesson, and you shall hear nothing but the\noutcries of boys under execution, with the thundering noise of their\npedagogues drunk with fury. A very pretty way this, to tempt these\ntender and timorous souls to love their book, with a furious\ncountenance, and a rod in hand!  A cursed and pernicious way of\nproceeding!  Besides what Quintilian has very well observed, that this\nimperious authority is often attended by very dangerous consequences,\nand particularly our way of chastising.  How much more decent would it\nbe to see their classes strewed with green leaves and fine flowers, than\nwith the bloody stumps of birch and willows?  Were it left to my\nordering.  I should paint the school with the pictures of joy and\ngladness; Flora and the Graces, as the philosopher Speusippus did his.\nWhere their profit is, let them there have their pleasure too. Such\nviands as are proper and wholesome for children, should be sweetened\nwith sugar, and such as are dangerous to them, embittered with gall.\n\u2018Tis marvellous to see how solicitous Plato is in his Laws concerning\nthe gaiety and diversion of the youth of his city, and how much and\noften he enlarges upon the races, sports, songs, leaps, and dances: of\nwhich, he says, that antiquity has given the ordering and patronage\nparticularly to the gods themselves, to Apollo, Minerva, and the Muses.\nHe insists long upon, and is very particular in, giving innumerable\nprecepts for exercises; but as to the lettered sciences, says very\nlittle, and only seems particularly to recommend poetry upon the account\nof music.\n\nAll singularity in our manners and conditions is to be avoided, as\ninconsistent with civil society.  Who would not be astonished at so\nstrange a constitution as that of Demophoon, steward to Alexander the\nGreat, who sweated in the shade and shivered in the sun?  I have seen\nthose who have run from the smell of a mellow apple with greater\nprecipitation than from a harquebuss-shot; others afraid of a mouse;\nothers vomit at the sight of cream; others ready to swoon at the making\nof a feather bed; Germanicus could neither endure the sight nor the\ncrowing of a cock.  I will not deny, but that there may, peradventure,\nbe some occult cause and natural aversion in these cases; but, in my\nopinion, a man might conquer it, if he took it in time.  Precept has in\nthis wrought so effectually upon me, though not without some pains on my\npart, I confess, that beer excepted, my appetite accommodates itself\nindifferently to all sorts of diet.  Young bodies are supple; one should,\ntherefore, in that age bend and ply them to all fashions and customs: and\nprovided a man can contain the appetite and the will within their due\nlimits, let a young man, in God\u2019s name, be rendered fit for all nations\nand all companies, even to debauchery and excess, if need be; that is,\nwhere he shall do it out of complacency to the customs of the place.\nLet him be able to do everything, but love to do nothing but what is\ngood.  The philosophers themselves do not justify Callisthenes for\nforfeiting the favour of his master Alexander the Great, by refusing to\npledge him a cup of wine.  Let him laugh, play, wench with his prince:\nnay, I would have him, even in his debauches, too hard for the rest of\nthe company, and to excel his companions in ability and vigour, and that\nhe may not give over doing it, either through defect of power or\nknowledge how to do it, but for want of will.\n\n     \u201cMultum interest, utrum peccare ali quis nolit, an nesciat.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThere is a vast difference betwixt forbearing to sin, and not\n     knowing how to sin.\u201d--Seneca, Ep., 90]\n\nI thought I passed a compliment upon a lord, as free from those excesses\nas any man in France, by asking him before a great deal of very good\ncompany, how many times in his life he had been drunk in Germany, in the\ntime of his being there about his Majesty\u2019s affairs; which he also took\nas it was intended, and made answer, \u201cThree times\u201d; and withal told us\nthe whole story of his debauches.  I know some who, for want of this\nfaculty, have found a great inconvenience in negotiating with that\nnation.  I have often with great admiration reflected upon the wonderful\nconstitution of Alcibiades, who so easily could transform himself to so\nvarious fashions without any prejudice to his health; one while outdoing\nthe Persian pomp and luxury, and another, the Lacedaemonian austerity and\nfrugality; as reformed in Sparta, as voluptuous in Ionia:\n\n          \u201cOmnis Aristippum decuit color, et status, et res.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cEvery complexion of life, and station, and circumstance became\n     Aristippus.\u201d--Horace, Ep., xvii. 23.]\n\nI would have my pupil to be such an one,\n\n                    \u201cQuem duplici panno patentia velat,\n               Mirabor, vitae via si conversa decebit,\n               Personamque feret non inconcinnus utramque.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cI should admire him who with patience bearing a patched garment,\n     bears well a changed fortune, acting both parts equally well.\u201d\n      --Horace Ep., xvii. 25.]\n\nThese are my lessons, and he who puts them in practice shall reap more\nadvantage than he who has had them read to him only, and so only knows\nthem.  If you see him, you hear him; if you hear him, you see him.  God\nforbid, says one in Plato, that to philosophise were only to read a great\nmany books, and to learn the arts.\n\n          \u201cHanc amplissimam omnium artium bene vivendi disciplinam,\n          vita magis quam literis, persequuti sunt.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThey have proceeded to this discipline of living well, which of\n     all arts is the greatest, by their lives, rather than by their\n     reading.\u201d--Cicero, Tusc. Quaes., iv. 3.]\n\nLeo, prince of the Phliasians, asking Heraclides Ponticus--[It was not\nHeraclides of Pontus who made this answer, but Pythagoras.]--of what art\nor science he made profession: \u201cI know,\u201d said he, \u201cneither art nor\nscience, but I am a philosopher.\u201d  One reproaching Diogenes that, being\nignorant, he should pretend to philosophy; \u201cI therefore,\u201d answered he,\n\u201cpretend to it with so much the more reason.\u201d  Hegesias entreated that he\nwould read a certain book to him: \u201cYou are pleasant,\u201d said he; \u201cyou\nchoose those figs that are true and natural, and not those that are\npainted; why do you not also choose exercises which are naturally true,\nrather than those written?\u201d\n\nThe lad will not so much get his lesson by heart as he will practise it:\nhe will repeat it in his actions.  We shall discover if there be prudence\nin his exercises, if there be sincerity and justice in his deportment, if\nthere be grace and judgment in his speaking; if there be constancy in his\nsickness; if there be modesty in his mirth, temperance in his pleasures,\norder in his domestic economy, indifference in palate, whether what he\neats or drinks be flesh or fish, wine or water:\n\n     \u201cQui disciplinam suam non ostentationem scientiae, sed legem vitae\n     putet: quique obtemperet ipse sibi, et decretis pareat.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cWho considers his own discipline, not as a vain ostentation of\n     science, but as a law and rule of life; and who obeys his own\n     decrees, and the laws he has prescribed for himself.\u201d\n      --Cicero, Tusc.  Quaes., ii. 4.]\n\nThe conduct of our lives is the true mirror of our doctrine.  Zeuxidamus,\nto one who asked him, why the Lacedaemonians did not commit their\nconstitutions of chivalry to writing, and deliver them to their young men\nto read, made answer, that it was because they would inure them to\naction, and not amuse them with words.  With such a one, after fifteen or\nsixteen years\u2019 study, compare one of our college Latinists, who has\nthrown away so much time in nothing but learning to speak.  The world is\nnothing but babble; and I hardly ever yet saw that man who did not rather\nprate too much, than speak too little.  And yet half of our age is\nembezzled this way: we are kept four or five years to learn words only,\nand to tack them together into clauses; as many more to form them into a\nlong discourse, divided into four or five parts; and other five years, at\nleast, to learn succinctly to mix and interweave them after a subtle and\nintricate manner let us leave all this to those who make a profession of\nit.\n\nGoing one day to Orleans, I met in that plain on this side Clery, two\npedants who were travelling towards Bordeaux, about fifty paces distant\nfrom one another; and, a good way further behind them, I discovered a\ntroop of horse, with a gentleman at the head of them, who was the late\nMonsieur le Comte de la Rochefoucauld.  One of my people inquired of the\nforemost of these masters of arts, who that gentleman was that came after\nhim; he, having not seen the train that followed after, and thinking his\ncompanion was meant, pleasantly answered, \u201cHe is not a gentleman; he is a\ngrammarian; and I am a logician.\u201d  Now we who, quite contrary, do not\nhere pretend to breed a grammarian or a logician, but a gentleman, let us\nleave them to abuse their leisure; our business lies elsewhere.  Let but\nour pupil be well furnished with things, words will follow but too fast;\nhe will pull them after him if they do not voluntarily follow.  I have\nobserved some to make excuses, that they cannot express themselves, and\npretend to have their fancies full of a great many very fine things,\nwhich yet, for want of eloquence, they cannot utter; \u2018tis a mere shift,\nand nothing else.  Will you know what I think of it?  I think they are\nnothing but shadows of some imperfect images and conceptions that they\nknow not what to make of within, nor consequently bring out; they do not\nyet themselves understand what they would be at, and if you but observe\nhow they haggle and stammer upon the point of parturition, you will soon\nconclude, that their labour is not to delivery, but about conception, and\nthat they are but licking their formless embryo.  For my part, I hold,\nand Socrates commands it, that whoever has in his mind a sprightly and\nclear imagination, he will express it well enough in one kind of tongue\nor another, and, if he be dumb, by signs--\n\n               \u201cVerbaque praevisam rem non invita sequentur;\u201d\n\n     [\u201cOnce a thing is conceived in the mind, the words to express it\n     soon present themselves.\u201d (\u201cThe words will not reluctantly follow the\n     thing preconceived.\u201d)--Horace, De Arte Poetica. v. 311]\n\nAnd as another as poetically says in his prose:\n\n          \u201cQuum res animum occupavere, verbs ambiunt,\u201d\n\n     [\u201cWhen things are once in the mind, the words offer themselves\n     readily.\u201d  (\u201cWhen things have taken possession of the mind, the\n     words trip.\u201d)--Seneca, Controvers., iii.  proem.]\n\nand this other.\n\n                    \u201cIpsae res verbs rapiunt.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThe things themselves force the words to express them.\u201d\n      --Cicero, De Finib., iii.  5.]\n\nHe knows nothing of ablative, conjunctive, substantive, or grammar, no\nmore than his lackey, or a fishwife of the Petit Pont; and yet these will\ngive you a bellyful of talk, if you will hear them, and peradventure\nshall trip as little in their language as the best masters of art in\nFrance.  He knows no rhetoric, nor how in a preface to bribe the\nbenevolence of the courteous reader; neither does he care to know it.\nIndeed all this fine decoration of painting is easily effaced by the\nlustre of a simple and blunt truth; these fine flourishes serve only to\namuse the vulgar, of themselves incapable of more solid and nutritive\ndiet, as Aper very evidently demonstrates in Tacitus.  The ambassadors\nof Samos, prepared with a long and elegant oration, came to Cleomenes,\nking of Sparta, to incite him to a war against the tyrant Polycrates;\nwho, after he had heard their harangue with great gravity and patience,\ngave them this answer: \u201cAs to the exordium, I remember it not, nor\nconsequently the middle of your speech; and for what concerns your\nconclusion, I will not do what you desire:\u201d--[Plutarch, Apothegms of the\nLacedaemonians.]--a very pretty answer this, methinks, and a pack of\nlearned orators most sweetly gravelled.  And what did the other man say?\nThe Athenians were to choose one of two architects for a very great\nbuilding they had designed; of these, the first, a pert affected fellow,\noffered his service in a long premeditated discourse upon the subject of\nthe work in hand, and by his oratory inclined the voices of the people in\nhis favour; but the other in three words: \u201cO Athenians, what this man\nsays, I will do.\u201d--[Plutarch, Instructions to Statesmen, c. 4.]--\nWhen Cicero was in the height and heat of an eloquent harangue, many were\nstruck with admiration; but Cato only laughed, saying, \u201cWe have a\npleasant (mirth-making) consul.\u201d  Let it go before, or come after, a good\nsentence or a thing well said, is always in season; if it neither suit\nwell with what went before, nor has much coherence with what follows\nafter, it is good in itself.  I am none of those who think that good\nrhyme makes a good poem.  Let him make short long, and long short if he\nwill, \u2018tis no great matter; if there be invention, and that the wit and\njudgment have well performed their offices, I will say, here\u2019s a good\npoet, but an ill rhymer.\n\n               \u201cEmunctae naris, durus componere versus.\u201d\n\n          [\u201cOf delicate humour, but of rugged versification.\u201d\n           --Horace, Sat, iv. 8.]\n\nLet a man, says Horace, divest his work of all method and measure,\n\n         \u201cTempora certa modosque, et, quod prius ordine verbum est,\n          Posterius facias, praeponens ultima primis\n          Invenias etiam disjecti membra poetae.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cTake away certain rhythms and measures, and make the word which\n     was first in order come later, putting that which should be last\n     first, you will still find the scattered remains of the poet.\u201d\n      --Horace, Sat., i. 4, 58.]\n\nhe will never the more lose himself for that; the very pieces will be\nfine by themselves.  Menander\u2019s answer had this meaning, who being\nreproved by a friend, the time drawing on at which he had promised a\ncomedy, that he had not yet fallen in hand with it; \u201cIt is made, and\nready,\u201d said he, \u201call but the verses.\u201d--[Plutarch, Whether the Athenians\nmore excelled in Arms or in Letters.]--Having contrived the subject, and\ndisposed the scenes in his fancy, he took little care for the rest.\nSince Ronsard and Du Bellay have given reputation to our French poesy,\nevery little dabbler, for aught I see, swells his words as high, and\nmakes his cadences very near as harmonious as they:\n\n                    \u201cPlus sonat, quam valet.\u201d\n\n               [\u201cMore sound than sense\u201d--Seneca, Ep., 40.]\n\nFor the vulgar, there were never so many poetasters as now; but though\nthey find it no hard matter to imitate their rhyme, they yet fall\ninfinitely short of imitating the rich descriptions of the one, and the\ndelicate invention of the other of these masters.\n\nBut what will become of our young gentleman, if he be attacked with the\nsophistic subtlety of some syllogism?  \u201cA Westfalia ham makes a man\ndrink; drink quenches thirst: ergo a Westfalia ham quenches thirst.\u201d\n Why, let him laugh at it; it will be more discretion to do so, than to go\nabout to answer it; or let him borrow this pleasant evasion from\nAristippus:  \u201cWhy should I trouble myself to untie that, which bound as\nit is, gives me so much trouble?\u201d--[Diogenes Laertius, ii. 70.]--\nOne offering at this dialectic juggling against Cleanthes, Chrysippus\ntook him short, saying, \u201cReserve these baubles to play with children,\nand do not by such fooleries divert the serious thoughts of a man of\nyears.\u201d  If these ridiculous subtleties,\n\n               \u201cContorta et aculeata sophismata,\u201d\n\nas Cicero calls them, are designed to possess him with an untruth, they\nare dangerous; but if they signify no more than only to make him laugh,\nI do not see why a man need to be fortified against them.  There are some\nso ridiculous, as to go a mile out of their way to hook in a fine word:\n\n          \u201cAut qui non verba rebus aptant, sed res extrinsecus\n          arcessunt, quibus verba conveniant.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cWho do not fit words to the subject, but seek out for things\n     quite from the purpose to fit the words.\u201d--Quintilian, viii. 3.]\n\nAnd as another says,\n\n          \u201cQui, alicujus verbi decore placentis, vocentur ad id,\n          quod non proposuerant scribere.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cWho by their fondness of some fine sounding word, are tempted to\n     something they had no intention to treat of.\u201d--Seneca, Ep., 59.]\n\nI for my part rather bring in a fine sentence by head and shoulders to\nfit my purpose, than divert my designs to hunt after a sentence.  On the\ncontrary, words are to serve, and to follow a man\u2019s purpose; and let\nGascon come in play where French will not do.  I would have things so\nexcelling, and so wholly possessing the imagination of him that hears,\nthat he should have something else to do, than to think of words.  The\nway of speaking that I love, is natural and plain, the same in writing as\nin speaking, and a sinewy and muscular way of expressing a man\u2019s self,\nshort and pithy, not so elegant and artificial as prompt and vehement;\n\n               \u201cHaec demum sapiet dictio, qux feriet;\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThat has most weight and wisdom which pierces the ear.\u201d (\u201cThat\n     utterance indeed will have a taste which shall strike the ear.\u201d)\n     --Epitaph on Lucan, in Fabricius, Biblioth.  Lat., ii. 10.]\n\nrather hard than wearisome; free from affectation; irregular,\nincontinuous, and bold; where every piece makes up an entire body; not\nlike a pedant, a preacher, or a pleader, but rather a soldier-like style,\nas Suetonius calls that of Julius Caesar; and yet I see no reason why he\nshould call it so.  I have ever been ready to imitate the negligent garb,\nwhich is yet observable amongst the young men of our time, to wear my\ncloak on one shoulder, my cap on one side, a stocking in disorder, which\nseems to express a kind of haughty disdain of these exotic ornaments, and\na contempt of the artificial; but I find this negligence of much better\nuse in the form of speaking.  All affectation, particularly in the French\ngaiety and freedom, is ungraceful in a courtier, and in a monarchy every\ngentleman ought to be fashioned according to the court model; for which\nreason, an easy and natural negligence does well.  I no more like a web\nwhere the knots and seams are to be seen, than a fine figure, so\ndelicate, that a man may tell all the bones and veins:\n\n     \u201cQuae veritati operam dat oratio, incomposita sit et simplex.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cLet the language that is dedicated to truth be plain and\n     unaffected.--Seneca, Ep. 40.]\n\n          \u201cQuis accurat loquitur, nisi qui vult putide loqui?\u201d\n\n     [\u201cFor who studies to speak accurately, that does not at the same\n     time wish to perplex his auditory?\u201d--Idem, Ep., 75.]\n\nThat eloquence prejudices the subject it would advance, that wholly\nattracts us to itself.  And as in our outward habit, \u2018tis a ridiculous\neffeminacy to distinguish ourselves by a particular and unusual garb or\nfashion; so in language, to study new phrases, and to affect words that\nare not of current use, proceeds from a puerile and scholastic ambition.\nMay I be bound to speak no other language than what is spoken in the\nmarket-places of Paris!  Aristophanes the grammarian was quite out, when\nhe reprehended Epicurus for his plain way of delivering himself, and the\ndesign of his oratory, which was only perspicuity of speech.\nThe imitation of words, by its own facility, immediately disperses itself\nthrough a whole people; but the imitation of inventing and fitly applying\nthose words is of a slower progress.  The generality of readers, for\nhaving found a like robe, very mistakingly imagine they have the same\nbody and inside too, whereas force and sinews are never to be borrowed;\nthe gloss, and outward ornament, that is, words and elocution, may.  Most\nof those I converse with, speak the same language I here write; but\nwhether they think the same thoughts I cannot say.  The Athenians, says\nPlato, study fulness and elegancy of speaking; the Lacedaemonians affect\nbrevity, and those of Crete to aim more at the fecundity of conception\nthan the fertility of speech; and these are the best.  Zeno used to say\nthat he had two sorts of disciples, one that he called cy-----ous,\ncurious to learn things, and these were his favourites; the other,\naoy---ous, that cared for nothing but words.  Not that fine speaking is\nnot a very good and commendable quality; but not so excellent and so\nnecessary as some would make it; and I am scandalised that our whole life\nshould be spent in nothing else.  I would first understand my own\nlanguage, and that of my neighbours, with whom most of my business and\nconversation lies.\n\nNo doubt but Greek and Latin are very great ornaments, and of very great\nuse, but we buy them too dear.  I will here discover one way, which has\nbeen experimented in my own person, by which they are to be had better\ncheap, and such may make use of it as will.  My late father having made\nthe most precise inquiry that any man could possibly make amongst men of\nthe greatest learning and judgment, of an exact method of education, was\nby them cautioned of this inconvenience then in use, and made to believe,\nthat the tedious time we applied to the learning of the tongues of them\nwho had them for nothing, was the sole cause we could not arrive to the\ngrandeur of soul and perfection of knowledge, of the ancient Greeks and\nRomans.  I do not, however, believe that to be the only cause.  So it is,\nthat the expedient my father found out for this was, that in my infancy,\nand before I began to speak, he committed me to the care of a German, who\nsince died a famous physician in France, totally ignorant of our\nlanguage, and very fluent and a great critic in Latin.  This man, whom he\nhad fetched out of his own country, and whom he entertained with a great\nsalary for this only one end, had me continually with him; he had with\nhim also joined two others, of inferior learning, to attend me, and to\nrelieve him; these spoke to me in no other language but Latin.  As to the\nrest of his household, it was an inviolable rule, that neither himself,\nnor my mother, nor valet, nor chambermaid, should speak anything in my\ncompany, but such Latin words as each one had learned to gabble with me.\n--[These passages are, the basis of a small volume by the Abbe Mangin:\n\u201cEducation de Montaigne; ou, L\u2019Art d\u2019enseigner le Latin a l\u2019instar des\nmeres latines.\u201d]--It is not to be imagined how great an advantage this\nproved to the whole family; my father and my mother by this means learned\nLatin enough to understand it perfectly well, and to speak it to such a\ndegree as was sufficient for any necessary use; as also those of the\nservants did who were most frequently with me.  In short, we Latined it\nat such a rate, that it overflowed to all the neighbouring villages,\nwhere there yet remain, that have established themselves by custom,\nseveral Latin appellations of artisans and their tools.  As for what\nconcerns myself, I was above six years of age before I understood either\nFrench or Perigordin, any more than Arabic; and without art, book,\ngrammar, or precept, whipping, or the expense of a tear, I had, by that\ntime, learned to speak as pure Latin as my master himself, for I had no\nmeans of mixing it up with any other.  If, for example, they were to give\nme a theme after the college fashion, they gave it to others in French;\nbut to me they were to give it in bad Latin, to turn it into that which\nwas good.  And Nicolas Grouchy, who wrote a book De Comitiis Romanorum;\nGuillaume Guerente, who wrote a comment upon Aristotle: George Buchanan,\nthat great Scottish poet: and Marc Antoine Muret (whom both France and\nItaly have acknowledged for the best orator of his time), my domestic\ntutors, have all of them often told me that I had in my infancy that\nlanguage so very fluent and ready, that they were afraid to enter into\ndiscourse with me.  And particularly Buchanan, whom I since saw attending\nthe late Mareschal de Brissac, then told me, that he was about to write a\ntreatise of education, the example of which he intended to take from\nmine; for he was then tutor to that Comte de Brissac who afterward proved\nso valiant and so brave a gentleman.\n\nAs to Greek, of which I have but a mere smattering, my father also\ndesigned to have it taught me by a device, but a new one, and by way of\nsport; tossing our declensions to and fro, after the manner of those who,\nby certain games of tables, learn geometry and arithmetic.  For he,\namongst other rules, had been advised to make me relish science and duty\nby an unforced will, and of my own voluntary motion, and to educate my\nsoul in all liberty and delight, without any severity or constraint;\nwhich he was an observer of to such a degree, even of superstition, if I\nmay say so, that some being of opinion that it troubles and disturbs the\nbrains of children suddenly to wake them in the morning, and to snatch\nthem violently--and over-hastily from sleep (wherein they are much more\nprofoundly involved than we), he caused me to be wakened by the sound of\nsome musical instrument, and was never unprovided of a musician for that\npurpose.  By this example you may judge of the rest, this alone being\nsufficient to recommend both the prudence and the affection of so good a\nfather, who is not to be blamed if he did not reap fruits answerable to\nso exquisite a culture.  Of this, two things were the cause: first, a\nsterile and improper soil; for, though I was of a strong and healthful\nconstitution, and of a disposition tolerably sweet and tractable, yet I\nwas, withal, so heavy, idle, and indisposed, that they could not rouse me\nfrom my sloth, not even to get me out to play.  What I saw, I saw clearly\nenough, and under this heavy complexion nourished a bold imagination and\nopinions above my age.  I had a slow wit that would go no faster than it\nwas led; a tardy understanding, a languishing invention, and above all,\nincredible defect of memory; so that, it is no wonder, if from all these\nnothing considerable could be extracted.  Secondly, like those who,\nimpatient of along and steady cure, submit to all sorts of prescriptions\nand recipes, the good man being extremely timorous of any way failing in\na thing he had so wholly set his heart upon, suffered himself at last to\nbe overruled by the common opinions, which always follow their leader as\na flight of cranes, and complying with the method of the time, having no\nmore those persons he had brought out of Italy, and who had given him the\nfirst model of education, about him, he sent me at six years of age to\nthe College of Guienne, at that time the best and most flourishing in\nFrance.  And there it was not possible to add anything to the care he had\nto provide me the most able tutors, with all other circumstances of\neducation, reserving also several particular rules contrary to the\ncollege practice; but so it was, that with all these precautions, it was\na college still.  My Latin immediately grew corrupt, of which also by\ndiscontinuance I have since lost all manner of use; so that this new way\nof education served me to no other end, than only at my first coming to\nprefer me to the first forms; for at thirteen years old, that I came out\nof the college, I had run through my whole course (as they call it), and,\nin truth, without any manner of advantage, that I can honestly brag of,\nin all this time.\n\nThe first taste which I had for books came to me from the pleasure in\nreading the fables of Ovid\u2019s Metamorphoses; for, being about seven or\neight years old, I gave up all other diversions to read them, both by\nreason that this was my own natural language, the easiest book that I was\nacquainted with, and for the subject, the most accommodated to the\ncapacity of my age: for as for the Lancelot of the Lake, the Amadis of\nGaul, the Huon of Bordeaux, and such farragos, by which children are most\ndelighted with, I had never so much as heard their names, no more than I\nyet know what they contain; so exact was the discipline wherein I was\nbrought up.  But this was enough to make me neglect the other lessons\nthat were prescribed me; and here it was infinitely to my advantage,\nto have to do with an understanding tutor, who very well knew discreetly\nto connive at this and other truantries of the same nature; for by this\nmeans I ran through Virgil\u2019s AEneid, and then Terence, and then Plautus,\nand then some Italian comedies, allured by the sweetness of the subject;\nwhereas had he been so foolish as to have taken me off this diversion,\nI do really believe, I had brought away nothing from the college but a\nhatred of books, as almost all our young gentlemen do.  But he carried\nhimself very discreetly in that business, seeming to take no notice, and\nallowing me only such time as I could steal from my other regular\nstudies, which whetted my appetite to devour those books.  For the chief\nthings my father expected from their endeavours to whom he had delivered\nme for education, were affability and good-humour; and, to say the truth,\nmy manners had no other vice but sloth and want of metal.  The fear was\nnot that I should do ill, but that I should do nothing; nobody\nprognosticated that I should be wicked, but only useless; they foresaw\nidleness, but no malice; and I find it falls out accordingly:\nThe complaints I hear of myself are these: \u201cHe is idle, cold in the\noffices of friendship and relation, and in those of the public, too\nparticular, too disdainful.\u201d  But the most injurious do not say, \u201cWhy has\nhe taken such a thing?  Why has he not paid such an one?\u201d  but, \u201cWhy does\nhe part with nothing?  Why does he not give?\u201d  And I should take it for a\nfavour that men would expect from me no greater effects of supererogation\nthan these.  But they are unjust to exact from me what I do not owe, far\nmore rigorously than they require from others that which they do owe.\nIn condemning me to it, they efface the gratification of the action, and\ndeprive me of the gratitude that would be my due for it; whereas the\nactive well-doing ought to be of so much the greater value from my hands,\nby how much I have never been passive that way at all.  I can the more\nfreely dispose of my fortune the more it is mine, and of myself the more\nI am my own.  Nevertheless, if I were good at setting out my own actions,\nI could, peradventure, very well repel these reproaches, and could give\nsome to understand, that they are not so much offended, that I do not\nenough, as that I am able to do a great deal more than I do.\n\nYet for all this heavy disposition of mine, my mind, when retired into\nitself, was not altogether without strong movements, solid and clear\njudgments about those objects it could comprehend, and could also,\nwithout any helps, digest them; but, amongst other things, I do really\nbelieve, it had been totally impossible to have made it to submit by\nviolence and force.  Shall I here acquaint you with one faculty of my\nyouth?  I had great assurance of countenance, and flexibility of voice\nand gesture, in applying myself to any part I undertook to act: for\nbefore--\n\n          \u201cAlter ab undecimo tum me vix ceperat annus,\u201d\n\n     [\u201cI had just entered my twelfth year.\u201d--Virgil, Bucol., 39.]\n\nI played the chief parts in the Latin tragedies of Buchanan, Guerente,\nand Muret, that were presented in our College of Guienne with great\ndignity: now Andreas Goveanus, our principal, as in all other parts of\nhis charge, was, without comparison, the best of that employment in\nFrance; and I was looked upon as one of the best actors.  \u2018Tis an\nexercise that I do not disapprove in young people of condition; and I\nhave since seen our princes, after the example of some of the ancients,\nin person handsomely and commendably perform these exercises; it was even\nallowed to persons of quality to make a profession of it in Greece.\n\n          \u201cAristoni tragico actori rem aperit: huic et genus et\n          fortuna honesta erant: nec ars, quia nihil tale apud\n          Graecos pudori est, ea deformabat.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cHe imparted this matter to Aristo the tragedian; a man of good\n     family and fortune, which neither of them receive any blemish by\n     that profession; nothing of this kind being reputed a disparagement\n     in Greece.\u201d--Livy, xxiv. 24.]\n\nNay, I have always taxed those with impertinence who condemn these\nentertainments, and with injustice those who refuse to admit such\ncomedians as are worth seeing into our good towns, and grudge the people\nthat public diversion.  Well-governed corporations take care to assemble\ntheir citizens, not only to the solemn duties of devotion, but also to\nsports and spectacles.  They find society and friendship augmented by it;\nand besides, can there possibly be allowed a more orderly and regular\ndiversion than what is performed m the sight of every one, and very often\nin the presence of the supreme magistrate himself?  And I, for my part,\nshould think it reasonable, that the prince should sometimes gratify his\npeople at his own expense, out of paternal goodness and affection; and\nthat in populous cities there should be theatres erected for such\nentertainments, if but to divert them from worse and private actions.\n\nTo return to my subject, there is nothing like alluring the appetite and\naffections; otherwise you make nothing but so many asses laden with\nbooks; by dint of the lash, you give them their pocketful of learning to\nkeep; whereas, to do well you should not only lodge it with them, but\nmake them espouse it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI\n\nTHAT IT IS FOLLY TO MEASURE TRUTH AND ERROR BY OUR OWN CAPACITY\n\n\u2018Tis not, perhaps, without reason, that we attribute facility of belief\nand easiness of persuasion to simplicity and ignorance: for I fancy I\nhave heard belief compared to the impression of a seal upon the soul,\nwhich by how much softer and of less resistance it is, is the more easy\nto be impressed upon.\n\n         \u201cUt necesse est, lancem in Libra, ponderibus impositis,\n          deprimi, sic animum perspicuis cedere.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cAs the scale of the balance must give way to the weight that\n     presses it down, so the mind yields to demonstration.\u201d\n      --Cicero, Acad., ii. 12.]\n\nBy how much the soul is more empty and without counterpoise, with so much\ngreater facility it yields under the weight of the first persuasion.  And\nthis is the reason that children, the common people, women, and sick\nfolks, are most apt to be led by the ears.  But then, on the other hand,\n\u2018tis a foolish presumption to slight and condemn all things for false\nthat do not appear to us probable; which is the ordinary vice of such as\nfancy themselves wiser than their neighbours.  I was myself once one of\nthose; and if I heard talk of dead folks walking, of prophecies,\nenchantments, witchcrafts, or any other story I had no mind to believe:\n\n              \u201cSomnia, terrores magicos, miracula, sagas,\n               Nocturnos lemures, portentaque Thessala,\u201d\n\n     [\u201cDreams, magic terrors, marvels, sorceries, Thessalian prodigies.\u201d\n      --Horace.  Ep. ii. 3, 208.]\n\nI presently pitied the poor people that were abused by these follies.\nWhereas I now find, that I myself was to be pitied as much, at least,\nas they; not that experience has taught me anything to alter my former\nopinions, though my curiosity has endeavoured that way; but reason has\ninstructed me, that thus resolutely to condemn anything for false and\nimpossible, is arrogantly and impiously to circumscribe and limit the\nwill of God, and the power of our mother nature, within the bounds of my\nown capacity, than which no folly can be greater.  If we give the names\nof monster and miracle to everything our reason cannot comprehend, how\nmany are continually presented before our eyes?  Let us but consider\nthrough what clouds, and as it were groping in the dark, our teachers\nlead us to the knowledge of most of the things about us; assuredly we\nshall find that it is rather custom than knowledge that takes away their\nstrangeness--\n\n                    \u201cJam nemo, fessus saturusque videndi,\n               Suspicere in coeli dignatur lucida templa;\u201d\n\n     [\u201cWeary of the sight, now no one deigns to look up to heaven\u2019s lucid\n     temples.\u201d--Lucretius, ii.  1037.  The text has \u2018statiate videnai\u2019]\n\nand that if those things were now newly presented to us, we should think\nthem as incredible, if not more, than any others.\n\n              \u201cSi nunc primum mortalibus adsint\n               Ex improviso, si sint objecta repente,\n               Nil magis his rebus poterat mirabile dici,\n               Aute minus ante quod auderent fore credere gentes.\u201d\n\n     [Lucretius, ii. 1032.  The sense of the passage is in the preceding\n     sentence.]\n\nHe that had never seen a river, imagined the first he met with to be the\nsea; and the greatest things that have fallen within our knowledge, we\nconclude the extremes that nature makes of the kind.\n\n              \u201cScilicet et fluvius qui non est maximus, ei\u2019st\n               Qui non ante aliquem majorem vidit; et ingens\n               Arbor, homoque videtur, et omnia de genere omni\n               Maxima quae vidit quisque, haec ingentia fingit.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cA little river seems to him, who has never seen a larger river, a\n     mighty stream; and so with other things--a tree, a man--anything\n     appears greatest to him that never knew a greater.\u201d--Idem, vi. 674.]\n\n         \u201cConsuetudine oculorum assuescunt animi, neque admirantur,\n          neque requirunt rationes earum rerum, quas semper vident.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThings grow familiar to men\u2019s minds by being often seen; so that\n     they neither admire nor are they inquisitive about things they daily\n     see.\u201d--Cicero, De Natura Deor., lib. ii. 38.]\n\nThe novelty, rather than the greatness of things, tempts us to inquire\ninto their causes.  We are to judge with more reverence, and with greater\nacknowledgment of our own ignorance and infirmity, of the infinite power\nof nature.  How many unlikely things are there testified by people worthy\nof faith, which, if we cannot persuade ourselves absolutely to believe,\nwe ought at least to leave them in suspense; for, to condemn them as\nimpossible, is by a temerarious presumption to pretend to know the utmost\nbounds of possibility.  Did we rightly understand the difference betwixt\nthe impossible and the unusual, and betwixt that which is contrary to the\norder and course of nature and contrary to the common opinion of men, in\nnot believing rashly, and on the other hand, in not being too\nincredulous, we should observe the rule of \u2018Ne quid nimis\u2019 enjoined by\nChilo.\n\nWhen we find in Froissart, that the Comte de Foix  knew in Bearn the\ndefeat of John, king of Castile, at Jubera the next day after it\nhappened, and the means by which he tells us he came to do so, we may be\nallowed to be a little merry at it, as also at what our annals report,\nthat Pope Honorius, the same day that King Philip Augustus died at\nMantes, performed his public obsequies at Rome, and commanded the like\nthroughout Italy, the testimony of these authors not being, perhaps, of\nauthority enough to restrain us.  But what if Plutarch, besides several\nexamples that he produces out of antiquity, tells us, he knows of certain\nknowledge, that in the time of Domitian, the news of the battle lost by\nAntony in Germany was published at Rome, many days\u2019 journey from thence,\nand dispersed throughout the whole world, the same day it was fought;\nand if Caesar was of opinion, that it has often happened, that the report\nhas preceded the incident, shall we not say, that these simple people\nhave suffered themselves to be deceived with the vulgar, for not having\nbeen so clear-sighted as we?  Is there anything more delicate, more\nclear, more sprightly; than Pliny\u2019s judgment, when he is pleased to set\nit to work?  Anything more remote from vanity?  Setting aside his\nlearning, of which I make less account, in which of these excellences do\nany of us excel him?  And yet there is scarce a young schoolboy that does\nnot convict him of untruth, and that pretends not to instruct him in the\nprogress of the works of nature.  When we read in Bouchet the miracles of\nSt. Hilary\u2019s relics, away with them: his authority is not sufficient to\ndeprive us of the liberty of contradicting him; but generally and offhand\nto condemn all suchlike stories, seems to me a singular impudence.  That\ngreat St. Augustin\u2019 testifies to have seen a blind child recover sight\nupon the relics of St. Gervasius and St. Protasius at Milan; a woman at\nCarthage cured of a cancer, by the sign of the cross made upon her by a\nwoman newly baptized; Hesperius, a familiar friend of his, to have driven\naway the spirits that haunted his house, with a little earth of the\nsepulchre of our Lord; which earth, being also transported thence into\nthe church, a paralytic to have there been suddenly cured by it; a woman\nin a procession, having touched St. Stephen\u2019s shrine with a nosegay, and\nrubbing her eyes with it, to have recovered her sight, lost many years\nbefore; with several other miracles of which he professes himself to have\nbeen an eyewitness: of what shall we excuse him and the two holy bishops,\nAurelius and Maximinus, both of whom he attests to the truth of these\nthings?  Shall it be of ignorance, simplicity, and facility; or of malice\nand imposture?  Is any man now living so impudent as to think himself\ncomparable to them in virtue, piety, learning, judgment, or any kind of\nperfection?\n\n              \u201cQui, ut rationem nullam afferrent,\n               ipsa auctoritate me frangerent.\u201d\n\n\n     [\u201cWho, though they should adduce no reason, would convince me with\n     their authority alone.\u201d--Cicero, Tusc. Quaes, i. 21.]\n\n\u2018Tis a presumption of great danger and consequence, besides the absurd\ntemerity it draws after it, to contemn what we do not comprehend.  For\nafter, according to your fine understanding, you have established the\nlimits of truth and error, and that, afterwards, there appears a\nnecessity upon you of believing stranger things than those you have\ncontradicted, you are already obliged to quit your limits.  Now, that\nwhich seems to me so much to disorder our consciences in the commotions\nwe are now in concerning religion, is the Catholics dispensing so much\nwith their belief.  They fancy they appear moderate, and wise, when they\ngrant to their opponents some of the articles in question; but, besides\nthat they do not discern what advantage it is to those with whom we\ncontend, to begin to give ground and to retire, and how much this\nanimates our enemy to follow his blow: these articles which they select\nas things indifferent, are sometimes of very great importance.  We are\neither wholly and absolutely to submit ourselves to the authority of our\necclesiastical polity, or totally throw off all obedience to it: \u2018tis not\nfor us to determine what and how much obedience we owe to it.  And this I\ncan say, as having myself made trial of it, that having formerly taken\nthe liberty of my own swing and fancy, and omitted or neglected certain\nrules of the discipline of our Church, which seemed to me vain and\nstrange coming afterwards to discourse of it with learned men, I have\nfound those same things to be built upon very good and solid ground and\nstrong foundation; and that nothing but stupidity and ignorance makes us\nreceive them with less reverence than the rest.  Why do we not consider\nwhat contradictions we find in our own judgments; how many things were\nyesterday articles of our faith, that to-day appear no other than fables?\nGlory and curiosity are the scourges of the soul; the last prompts us to\nthrust our noses into everything, the other forbids us to leave anything\ndoubtful and undecided.\n\n\n\n\n     ETEXT EDITOR\u2019S BOOKMARKS:\n\n     A child should not be brought up in his mother\u2019s lap\n     Acquiesce and submit to truth\n     Affect words that are not of current use\n     Anything appears greatest to him that never knew a greater\n     Appetite to read more, than glutted with that we have\n     Applaud his judgment than commend his knowledge\n     Attribute facility of belief to simplicity and ignorance\n     Away with this violence!  away with this compulsion!\n     Bears well a changed fortune, acting both parts equally well\n     Belief compared to the impression of a seal upon the soul\n     cloak on one shoulder, my cap on one side, a stocking disordered\n     College: a real house of correction of imprisoned youth\n     Disgorge what we eat in the same condition it was swallowed\n     Education ought to be carried on with a severe sweetness\n     Eloquence prejudices the subject it would advance\n     Fear was not that I should do ill, but that I should do nothing\n     Glory and curiosity are the scourges of the soul\n     Hobbes said that if he had been at college as long as others--\n     Inquisitive after everything\n     Insert whole sections and pages out of ancient authors\n     It is no hard matter to get children\n     Learn what it is right to wish\n     Least touch or prick of a pencil in comparison of the whole\n     Let him be satisfied with correcting himself\n     Let him examine every man\u2019s talent\n     Light prognostics they give of themselves in their tender years\n     Living well, which of all arts is the greatest\n     Lodge nothing in his fancy upon simple authority and upon trust\n     Man may say too much even upon the best subjects\n     Miracle: everything our reason cannot comprehend\n     Morosity and melancholic humour of a sour ill-natured pedant\n     Mothers are too tender\n     Negligent garb, which is yet observable amongst the young men\n     Nobody prognosticated that I should be wicked, but only useless\n     Not having been able to pronounce one syllable, which is No!\n     O Athenians, what this man says, I will do\n     Obstinacy and contention are common qualities\n     Occasion to La Boetie to write his \u201cVoluntary Servitude\u201d\n      Philosophy has discourses proper for childhood\n     Philosophy is that which instructs us to live\n     Philosophy looked upon as a vain and fantastic name\n     Preface to bribe the benevolence of the courteous reader\n     Reading those books, converse with the great and heroic souls\n     Silence, therefore, and modesty are very advantageous qualities\n     So many trillions of men, buried before us\n     Sparing and an husband of his knowledge\n     The conduct of our lives is the true mirror of our doctrine\n     The most manifest sign of wisdom is a continual cheerfulness\n     Their labour is not to delivery, but about conception\n     There is nothing like alluring the appetite and affections\n     They begin to teach us to live when we have almost done living\n     Things grow familiar to men\u2019s minds by being often seen\n     To condemn them as impossible, is by a temerarious presumption\n     To contemn what we do not comprehend\n     To go a mile out of their way to hook in a fine word\n     To know by rote, is no knowledge\n     Tongue will grow too stiff to bend\n     Totally brutified by an immoderate thirst after knowledge\n     Unbecoming rudeness to carp at everything\n     Unjust to exact from me what I do not owe\n     Where their profit is, let them there have their pleasure too\n     Who by their fondness of some fine sounding word\n\n\n\n\n\n\nESSAYS OF MICHEL DE MONTAIGNE\n\nTranslated by Charles Cotton\n\nEdited by William Carew Hazlitt\n\n1877\n\n\n\nCONTENTS OF VOLUME 6.\n\nXXVII.

He chooses the fairest place and middle of any\nwall, or panel, wherein to draw a picture, which he finishes with his\nutmost care and art, and the vacuity about it he fills with grotesques,\nwhich are odd fantastic figures without any grace but what they derive\nfrom their variety, and the extravagance of their shapes.  And in truth,\nwhat are these things I scribble, other than grotesques and monstrous\nbodies, made of various parts, without any certain figure, or any other\nthan accidental order, coherence, or proportion?\n\n               \u201cDesinit in piscem mulier formosa superne.\u201d\n\n          [\u201cA fair woman in her upper form terminates in a fish.\u201d\n           --Horace, De Arte Poetica, v. 4.]\n\nIn this second part I go hand in hand with my painter; but fall very\nshort of him in the first and the better, my power of handling not being\nsuch, that I dare to offer at a rich piece, finely polished, and set off\naccording to art.  I have therefore thought fit to borrow one of Estienne\nde la Boetie, and such a one as shall honour and adorn all the rest of my\nwork--namely, a discourse that he called \u2018Voluntary Servitude\u2019; but,\nsince, those who did not know him have properly enough called it \u201cLe\ncontr Un.\u201d  He wrote in his youth,--[\u201cNot being as yet eighteen years\nold.\u201d--Edition of 1588.] by way of essay, in honour of liberty against\ntyrants; and it has since run through the hands of men of great learning\nand judgment, not without singular and merited commendation; for it is\nfinely written, and as full as anything can possibly be.  And yet one may\nconfidently say it is far short of what he was able to do; and if in that\nmore mature age, wherein I had the happiness to know him, he had taken a\ndesign like this of mine, to commit his thoughts to writing, we should\nhave seen a great many rare things, and such as would have gone very near\nto have rivalled the best writings of antiquity: for in natural parts\nespecially, I know no man comparable to him.  But he has left nothing\nbehind him, save this treatise only (and that too by chance, for I\nbelieve he never saw it after it first went out of his hands), and some\nobservations upon that edict of January--[1562, which granted to the\nHuguenots the public exercise of their religion.]--made famous by our\ncivil-wars, which also shall elsewhere, peradventure, find a place.\nThese were all I could recover of his remains, I to whom with so\naffectionate a remembrance, upon his death-bed, he by his last will\nbequeathed his library and papers, the little book of his works only\nexcepted, which I committed to the press.  And this particular obligation\nI have to this treatise of his, that it was the occasion of my first\ncoming acquainted with him; for it was showed to me long before I had the\ngood fortune to know him; and the first knowledge of his name, proving\nthe first cause and foundation of a friendship, which we afterwards\nimproved and maintained, so long as God was pleased to continue us\ntogether, so perfect, inviolate, and entire, that certainly the like is\nhardly to be found in story, and amongst the men of this age, there is no\nsign nor trace of any such thing in use; so much concurrence is required\nto the building of such a one, that \u2018tis much, if fortune bring it but\nonce to pass in three ages.\n\nThere is nothing to which nature seems so much to have inclined us, as to\nsociety; and Aristotle , says that the good legislators had more respect\nto friendship than to justice.  Now the most supreme point of its\nperfection is this: for, generally, all those that pleasure, profit,\npublic or private interest create and nourish, are so much the less\nbeautiful and generous, and so much the less friendships, by how much\nthey mix another cause, and design, and fruit in friendship, than itself.\nNeither do the four ancient kinds, natural, social, hospitable, venereal,\neither separately or jointly, make up a true and perfect friendship.\n\nThat of children to parents is rather respect: friendship is nourished by\ncommunication, which cannot by reason of the great disparity, be betwixt\nthese, but would rather perhaps offend the duties of nature; for neither\nare all the secret thoughts of fathers fit to be communicated to\nchildren, lest it beget an indecent familiarity betwixt them; nor can the\nadvices and reproofs, which is one of the principal offices of\nfriendship, be properly performed by the son to the father.  There are\nsome countries where \u2018twas the custom for children to kill their fathers;\nand others, where the fathers killed their children, to avoid their being\nan impediment one to another in life; and naturally the expectations of\nthe one depend upon the ruin of the other.  There have been great\nphilosophers who have made nothing of this tie of nature, as Aristippus\nfor one, who being pressed home about the affection he owed to his\nchildren, as being come out of him, presently fell to spit, saying, that\nthis also came out of him, and that we also breed worms and lice; and\nthat other, that Plutarch endeavoured to reconcile to his brother:\n\u201cI make never the more account of him,\u201d said he, \u201cfor coming out of the\nsame hole.\u201d  This name of brother does indeed carry with it a fine and\ndelectable sound, and for that reason, he and I called one another\nbrothers but the complication of interests, the division of estates, and\nthat the wealth of the one should be the property of the other, strangely\nrelax and weaken the fraternal tie: brothers pursuing their fortune and\nadvancement by the same path, \u2018tis hardly possible but they must of\nnecessity often jostle and hinder one another.  Besides, why is it\nnecessary that the correspondence of manners, parts, and inclinations,\nwhich begets the true and perfect friendships, should always meet in\nthese relations?  The father and the son may be of quite contrary\nhumours, and so of brothers: he is my son, he is my brother; but he is\npassionate, ill-natured, or a fool.  And moreover, by how much these are\nfriendships that the law and natural obligation impose upon us, so much\nless is there of our own choice and voluntary freedom; whereas that\nvoluntary liberty of ours has no production more promptly and; properly\nits own than affection and friendship.  Not that I have not in my own\nperson experimented all that can possibly be expected of that kind,\nhaving had the best and most indulgent father, even to his extreme old\nage, that ever was, and who was himself descended from a family for many\ngenerations famous and exemplary for brotherly concord:\n\n                                   \u201cEt ipse\n                    Notus in fratres animi paterni.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cAnd I myself, known for paternal love toward my brothers.\u201d\n      --Horace, Ode, ii. 2, 6.]\n\nWe are not here to bring the love we bear to women, though it be an act\nof our own choice, into comparison, nor rank it with the others.  The\nfire of this, I confess,\n\n                   \u201cNeque enim est dea nescia nostri\n                    Qux dulcem curis miscet amaritiem,\u201d\n\n     [\u201cNor is the goddess unknown to me who mixes a sweet bitterness\n     with my love.\u201d---Catullus, lxviii. 17.]\n\nis more active, more eager, and more sharp: but withal, \u2018tis more\nprecipitant, fickle, moving, and inconstant; a fever subject to\nintermissions and paroxysms, that has seized but on one part of us.\nWhereas in friendship, \u2018tis a general and universal fire, but temperate\nand equal, a constant established heat, all gentle and smooth, without\npoignancy or roughness.  Moreover, in love, \u2018tis no other than frantic\ndesire for that which flies from us:\n\n              \u201cCome segue la lepre il cacciatore\n               Al freddo, al caldo, alla montagna, al lito;\n               Ne piu l\u2019estima poi the presa vede;\n               E sol dietro a chi fugge affretta il piede\u201d\n\n     [\u201cAs the hunter pursues the hare, in cold and heat, to the mountain,\n     to the shore, nor cares for it farther when he sees it taken, and\n     only delights in chasing that which flees from him.\u201d--Aristo, x. 7.]\n\nso soon as it enters unto the terms of friendship, that is to say, into a\nconcurrence of desires, it vanishes and is gone, fruition destroys it,\nas having only a fleshly end, and such a one as is subject to satiety.\nFriendship, on the contrary, is enjoyed proportionably as it is desired;\nand only grows up, is nourished and improved by enjoyment, as being of\nitself spiritual, and the soul growing still more refined by practice.\nUnder this perfect friendship, the other fleeting affections have in my\nyounger years found some place in me, to say nothing of him, who himself\nso confesses but too much in his verses; so that I had both these\npassions, but always so, that I could myself well enough distinguish\nthem, and never in any degree of comparison with one another; the first\nmaintaining its flight in so lofty and so brave a place, as with disdain\nto look down, and see the other flying at a far humbler pitch below.\n\nAs concerning marriage, besides that it is a covenant, the entrance into\nwhich only is free, but the continuance in it forced and compulsory,\nhaving another dependence than that of our own free will, and a bargain\ncommonly contracted to other ends, there almost always happens a thousand\nintricacies in it to unravel, enough to break the thread and to divert\nthe current of a lively affection: whereas friendship has no manner of\nbusiness or traffic with aught but itself.  Moreover, to say truth, the\nordinary talent of women is not such as is sufficient to maintain the\nconference and communication required to the support of this sacred tie;\nnor do they appear to be endued with constancy of mind, to sustain the\npinch of so hard and durable a knot.  And doubtless, if without this,\nthere could be such a free and voluntary familiarity contracted, where\nnot only the souls might have this entire fruition, but the bodies also\nmight share in the alliance, and a man be engaged throughout, the\nfriendship would certainly be more full and perfect; but it is without\nexample that this sex has ever yet arrived at such perfection; and, by\nthe common consent of the ancient schools, it is wholly rejected from it.\n\nThat other Grecian licence is justly abhorred by our manners, which also,\nfrom having, according to their practice, a so necessary disparity of age\nand difference of offices betwixt the lovers, answered no more to the\nperfect union and harmony that we here require than the other:\n\n         \u201cQuis est enim iste amor amicitiae? cur neque deformem\n          adolescentem quisquam amat, neque formosum senem?\u201d\n\n     [\u201cFor what is that friendly love? why does no one love a deformed\n     youth or a comely old man?\u201d--Cicero, Tusc.  Quaes., iv. 33.]\n\nNeither will that very picture that the Academy presents of it, as I\nconceive, contradict me, when I say, that this first fury inspired by the\nson of Venus into the heart of the lover, upon sight of the flower and\nprime of a springing and blossoming youth, to which they allow all the\ninsolent and passionate efforts that an immoderate ardour can produce,\nwas simply founded upon external beauty, the false image of corporal\ngeneration; for it could not ground this love upon the soul, the sight of\nwhich as yet lay concealed, was but now springing, and not of maturity to\nblossom; that this fury, if it seized upon a low spirit, the means by\nwhich it preferred its suit were rich presents, favour in advancement to\ndignities, and such trumpery, which they by no means approve; if on a\nmore generous soul, the pursuit was suitably generous, by philosophical\ninstructions, precepts to revere religion, to obey the laws, to die for\nthe good of one\u2019s country; by examples of valour, prudence, and justice,\nthe lover studying to render himself acceptable by the grace and beauty\nof the soul, that of his body being long since faded and decayed, hoping\nby this mental society to establish a more firm and lasting contract.\nWhen this courtship came to effect in due season (for that which they do\nnot require in the lover, namely, leisure and discretion in his pursuit,\nthey strictly require in the person loved, forasmuch as he is to judge of\nan internal beauty, of difficult knowledge and abstruse discovery), then\nthere sprung in the person loved the desire of a spiritual conception;\nby the mediation of a spiritual beauty.  This was the principal; the\ncorporeal, an accidental and secondary matter; quite the contrary as to\nthe lover.  For this reason they prefer the person beloved, maintaining\nthat the gods in like manner preferred him too, and very much blame the\npoet AEschylus for having, in the loves of Achilles and Patroclus, given\nthe lover\u2019s part to Achilles, who was in the first and beardless flower\nof his adolescence, and the handsomest of all the Greeks.  After this\ngeneral community, the sovereign, and most worthy part presiding and\ngoverning, and performing its proper offices, they say, that thence great\nutility was derived, both by private and public concerns; that it\nconstituted the force and power of the countries where it prevailed, and\nthe chiefest security of liberty and justice.  Of which the healthy loves\nof Harmodius and Aristogiton are instances.  And therefore it is that\nthey called it sacred and divine, and conceive that nothing but the\nviolence of tyrants and the baseness of the common people are inimical to\nit.  Finally, all that can be said in favour of the Academy is, that it\nwas a love which ended in friendship, which well enough agrees with the\nStoical definition of love:\n\n              \u201cAmorem conatum esse amicitiae faciendae\n               ex pulchritudinis specie.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cLove is a desire of contracting friendship arising from the beauty\n     of the object.\u201d--Cicero, Tusc. Quaes., vi. 34.]\n\nI return to my own more just and true description:\n\n          \u201cOmnino amicitiae, corroboratis jam confirmatisque,\n          et ingeniis, et aetatibus, judicandae sunt.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThose are only to be reputed friendships that are fortified and\n     confirmed by judgement and the length of time.\u201d\n      --Cicero, De Amicit., c. 20.]\n\nFor the rest, what we commonly call friends and friendships, are nothing\nbut acquaintance and familiarities, either occasionally contracted, or\nupon some design, by means of which there happens some little intercourse\nbetwixt our souls.  But in the friendship I speak of, they mix and work\nthemselves into one piece, with so universal a mixture, that there is no\nmore sign of the seam by which they were first conjoined.  If a man\nshould importune me to give a reason why I loved him, I find it could no\notherwise be expressed, than by making answer: because it was he, because\nit was I.  There is, beyond all that I am able to say, I know not what\ninexplicable and fated power that brought on this union.  We sought one\nanother long before we met, and by the characters we heard of one\nanother, which wrought upon our affections more than, in reason, mere\nreports should do; I think \u2018twas by some secret appointment of heaven.\nWe embraced in our names; and at our first meeting, which was\naccidentally at a great city entertainment, we found ourselves so\nmutually taken with one another, so acquainted, and so endeared betwixt\nourselves, that from thenceforward nothing was so near to us as one\nanother.  He wrote an excellent Latin satire, since printed, wherein he\nexcuses the precipitation of our intelligence, so suddenly come to\nperfection, saying, that destined to have so short a continuance, as\nbegun so late (for we were both full-grown men, and he some years the\nolder), there was no time to lose, nor were we tied to conform to the\nexample of those slow and regular friendships, that require so many\nprecautions of long preliminary conversation: This has no other idea than\nthat of itself, and can only refer to itself: this is no one special\nconsideration, nor two, nor three, nor four, nor a thousand; \u2018tis I know\nnot what quintessence of all this mixture, which, seizing my whole will,\ncarried it to plunge and lose itself in his, and that having seized his\nwhole will, brought it back with equal concurrence and appetite to plunge\nand lose itself in mine.  I may truly say lose, reserving nothing to\nourselves that was either his or mine.--[All this relates to Estienne de\nla Boetie.]\n\nWhen Laelius,--[Cicero, De Amicit., c. II.]--in the presence of the\nRoman consuls, who after thay had sentenced Tiberius Gracchus, prosecuted\nall those who had had any familiarity with him also; came to ask Caius\nBlosius, who was his chiefest friend, how much he would have done for\nhim, and that he made answer:  \u201cAll things.\u201d--\u201cHow!  All things!\u201d  said\nLaelius.  \u201cAnd what if he had commanded you to fire our temples?\u201d--\u201cHe\nwould never have commanded me that,\u201d replied Blosius.--\u201cBut what if he\nhad?\u201d said Laelius.--\u201cI would have obeyed him,\u201d said the other.  If he\nwas so perfect a friend to Gracchus as the histories report him to have\nbeen, there was yet no necessity of offending the consuls by such a bold\nconfession, though he might still have retained the assurance he had of\nGracchus\u2019 disposition.  However, those who accuse this answer as\nseditious, do not well understand the mystery; nor presuppose, as it was\ntrue, that he had Gracchus\u2019 will in his sleeve, both by the power of a\nfriend, and the perfect knowledge he had of the man: they were more\nfriends than citizens, more friends to one another than either enemies or\nfriends to their country, or than friends to ambition and innovation;\nhaving absolutely given up themselves to one another, either held\nabsolutely the reins of the other\u2019s inclination; and suppose all this\nguided by virtue, and all this by the conduct of reason, which also\nwithout these it had not been possible to do, Blosius\u2019 answer was such as\nit ought to be.  If any of their actions flew out of the handle, they\nwere neither (according to my measure of friendship) friends to one\nanother, nor to themselves.  As to the rest, this answer carries no worse\nsound, than mine would do to one that should ask me: \u201cIf your will should\ncommand you to kill your daughter, would you do it?\u201d and that I should\nmake answer, that I would; for this expresses no consent to such an act,\nforasmuch as I do not in the least suspect my own will, and as little\nthat of such a friend.  \u2018Tis not in the power of all the eloquence in the\nworld, to dispossess me of the certainty I have of the intentions and\nresolutions of my friend; nay, no one action of his, what face soever it\nmight bear, could be presented to me, of which I could not presently,\nand at first sight, find out the moving cause.  Our souls had drawn so\nunanimously together, they had considered each other with so ardent an\naffection, and with the like affection laid open the very bottom of our\nhearts to one another\u2019s view, that I not only knew his as well as my own;\nbut should certainly in any concern of mine have trusted my interest much\nmore willingly with him, than with myself.\n\nLet no one, therefore, rank other common friendships with such a one as\nthis.  I have had as much experience of these as another, and of the most\nperfect of their kind: but I do not advise that any should confound the\nrules of the one and the other, for they would find themselves much\ndeceived.  In those other ordinary friendships, you are to walk with\nbridle in your hand, with prudence and circumspection, for in them the\nknot is not so sure that a man may not half suspect it will slip.  \u201cLove\nhim,\u201d said Chilo,--[Aulus Gellius, i. 3.]--\u201cso as if you were one day to\nhate him; and hate him so as you were one day to love him.\u201d  This\nprecept, though abominable in the sovereign and perfect friendship I\nspeak of, is nevertheless very sound as to the practice of the ordinary\nand customary ones, and to which the saying that Aristotle had so\nfrequent in his mouth, \u201cO my friends, there is no friend,\u201d may very fitly\nbe applied.  In this noble commerce, good offices, presents, and\nbenefits, by which other friendships are supported and maintained, do not\ndeserve so much as to be mentioned; and the reason is the concurrence of\nour wills; for, as the kindness I have for myself receives no increase,\nfor anything I relieve myself withal in time of need (whatever the Stoics\nsay), and as I do not find myself obliged to myself for any service I do\nmyself: so the union of such friends, being truly perfect, deprives them\nof all idea of such duties, and makes them loathe and banish from their\nconversation these words of division and distinction, benefits,\nobligation, acknowledgment, entreaty, thanks, and the like.  All things,\nwills, thoughts, opinions, goods, wives, children, honours, and lives,\nbeing in effect common betwixt them, and that absolute concurrence of\naffections being no other than one soul in two bodies (according to that\nvery proper definition of Aristotle), they can neither lend nor give\nanything to one another.  This is the reason why the lawgivers, to honour\nmarriage with some resemblance of this divine alliance, interdict all\ngifts betwixt man and wife; inferring by that, that all should belong to\neach of them, and that they have nothing to divide or to give to each\nother.\n\nIf, in the friendship of which I speak, one could give to the other, the\nreceiver of the benefit would be the man that obliged his friend; for\neach of them contending and above all things studying how to be useful to\nthe other, he that administers the occasion is the liberal man, in giving\nhis friend the satisfaction of doing that towards him which above all\nthings he most desires.  When the philosopher Diogenes wanted money, he\nused to say, that he redemanded it of his friends, not that he demanded\nit.  And to let you see the practical working of this, I will here\nproduce an ancient and singular example.  Eudamidas, a Corinthian, had\ntwo friends, Charixenus a Sicyonian and Areteus a Corinthian; this man\ncoming to die, being poor, and his two friends rich, he made his will\nafter this manner.  \u201cI bequeath to Areteus the maintenance of my mother,\nto support and provide for her in her old age; and to Charixenus I\nbequeath the care of marrying my daughter, and to give her as good a\nportion as he is able; and in case one of these chance to die, I hereby\nsubstitute the survivor in his place.\u201d  They who first saw this will made\nthemselves very merry at the contents: but the legatees, being made\nacquainted with it, accepted it with very great content; and one of them,\nCharixenus, dying within five days after, and by that means the charge of\nboth duties devolving solely on him, Areteus nurtured the old woman with\nvery great care and tenderness, and of five talents he had in estate, he\ngave two and a half in marriage with an only daughter he had of his own,\nand two and a half in marriage with the daughter of Eudamidas, and on one\nand the same day solemnised both their nuptials.\n\nThis example is very full, if one thing were not to be objected, namely\nthe multitude of friends for the perfect friendship I speak of is\nindivisible; each one gives himself so entirely to his friend, that he\nhas nothing left to distribute to others: on the contrary, is sorry that\nhe is not double, treble, or quadruple, and that he has not many souls\nand many wills, to confer them all upon this one object.  Common\nfriendships will admit of division; one may love the beauty of this\nperson, the good-humour of that, the liberality of a third, the paternal\naffection of a fourth, the fraternal love of a fifth, and so of the rest:\nbut this friendship that possesses the whole soul, and there rules and\nsways with an absolute sovereignty, cannot possibly admit of a rival.\nIf two at the same time should call to you for succour, to which of them\nwould you run?  Should they require of you contrary offices, how could\nyou serve them both?  Should one commit a thing to your silence that it\nwere of importance to the other to know, how would you disengage\nyourself?  A unique and particular friendship dissolves all other\nobligations whatsoever: the secret I have sworn not to reveal to any\nother, I may without perjury communicate to him who is not another, but\nmyself.  \u2018Tis miracle enough certainly, for a man to double himself, and\nthose that talk of tripling, talk they know not of what.  Nothing is\nextreme, that has its like; and he who shall suppose, that of two, I love\none as much as the other, that they mutually love one another too, and\nlove me as much as I love them, multiplies into a confraternity the most\nsingle of units, and whereof, moreover, one alone is the hardest thing in\nthe world to find.  The rest of this story suits very well with what I\nwas saying; for Eudamidas, as a bounty and favour, bequeaths to his\nfriends a legacy of employing themselves in his necessity; he leaves them\nheirs to this liberality of his, which consists in giving them the\nopportunity of conferring a benefit upon him; and doubtless, the force of\nfriendship is more eminently apparent in this act of his, than in that of\nAreteus.  In short, these are effects not to be imagined nor comprehended\nby such as have not experience of them, and which make me infinitely\nhonour and admire the answer of that young soldier to Cyrus, by whom\nbeing asked how much he would take for a horse, with which he had won the\nprize of a race, and whether he would exchange him for a kingdom?\n--\u201cNo, truly, sir,\u201d said he, \u201cbut I would give him with all my heart,\nto get thereby a true friend, could I find out any man worthy of that\nalliance.\u201d--[Xenophon, Cyropadia, viii.  3.]--He did not say ill in\nsaying, \u201ccould I find\u201d: for though one may almost everywhere meet with\nmen sufficiently qualified for a superficial acquaintance, yet in this,\nwhere a man is to deal from the very bottom of his heart, without any\nmanner of reservation, it will be requisite that all the wards and\nsprings be truly wrought and perfectly sure.\n\nIn confederations that hold but by one end, we are only to provide\nagainst the imperfections that particularly concern that end.  It can be\nof no importance to me of what religion my physician or my lawyer is;\nthis consideration has nothing in common with the offices of friendship\nwhich they owe me; and I am of the same indifference in the domestic\nacquaintance my servants must necessarily contract with me.  I never\ninquire, when I am to take a footman, if he be chaste, but if he be\ndiligent; and am not solicitous if my muleteer be given to gaming, as if\nhe be strong and able; or if my cook be a swearer, if he be a good cook.\nI do not take upon me to direct what other men should do in the\ngovernment of their families, there are plenty that meddle enough with\nthat, but only give an account of my method in my own:\n\n          \u201cMihi sic usus est: tibi, ut opus est facto, face.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThis has been my way; as for you, do as you find needful.\n     --\u201cTerence, Heaut., i. I., 28.]\n\nFor table-talk, I prefer the pleasant and witty before the learned and\nthe grave; in bed, beauty before goodness; in common discourse the ablest\nspeaker, whether or no there be sincerity in the case.  And, as he that\nwas found astride upon a hobby-horse, playing with his children,\nentreated the person who had surprised him in that posture to say nothing\nof it till himself came to be a father,--[Plutarch, Life of Agesilaus,\nc.  9.]--supposing that the fondness that would then possess his own\nsoul, would render him a fairer judge of such an action; so I, also,\ncould wish to speak to such as have had experience of what I say: though,\nknowing how remote a thing such a friendship is from the common practice,\nand how rarely it is to be found, I despair of meeting with any such\njudge.  For even these discourses left us by antiquity upon this subject,\nseem to me flat and poor, in comparison of the sense I have of it, and in\nthis particular, the effects surpass even the precepts of philosophy.\n\n               \u201cNil ego contulerim jucundo sanus amico.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cWhile I have sense left to me, there will never be anything more\n     acceptable to me than an agreeable friend.\u201d\n      --Horace, Sat., i. 5, 44.]\n\nThe ancient Menander declared him to be happy that had had the good\nfortune to meet with but the shadow of a friend: and doubtless he had\ngood reason to say so, especially if he spoke by experience: for in good\nearnest, if I compare all the rest of my life, though, thanks be to God,\nI have passed my time pleasantly enough, and at my ease, and the loss of\nsuch a friend excepted, free from any grievous affliction, and in great\ntranquillity of mind, having been contented with my natural and original\ncommodities, without being solicitous after others; if I should compare\nit all, I say, with the four years I had the happiness to enjoy the sweet\nsociety of this excellent man, \u2018tis nothing but smoke, an obscure and\ntedious night.  From the day that I lost him:\n\n                              \u201cQuern semper acerbum,\n               Semper honoratum (sic, di, voluistis) habebo,\u201d\n\n     [\u201cA day for me ever sad, for ever sacred, so have you willed ye\n     gods.\u201d--AEneid, v. 49.]\n\nI have only led a languishing life; and the very pleasures that present\nthemselves to me, instead of administering anything of consolation,\ndouble my affliction for his loss.  We were halves throughout, and to\nthat degree, that methinks, by outliving him, I defraud him of his part.\n\n              \u201cNec fas esse ulla me voluptate hic frui\n               Decrevi, tantisper dum ille abest meus particeps.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cI have determined that it will never be right for me to enjoy any\n     pleasure, so long as he, with whom I shared all pleasures is away.\u201d\n      --Terence, Heaut., i.

The edition of 1580, however, and the\n     Variorum edition of 1872-1900, indicate no particular work; but the\n     edition of 1580 has it \u201cthis boy of eighteen years\u201d (which was the\n     age at which La Boetie wrote his \u201cServitude Volontaire\u201d), speaks of\n     \u201ca boy of sixteen\u201d as occurring only in the common editions, and it\n     would seem tolerably clear that this more important work was, in\n     fact, the production to which Montaigne refers, and that the proper\n     reading of the text should be \u201csixteen years.\u201d  What \u201cthis boy\n     spoke\u201d is not given by Montaigne, for the reason stated in the next\n     following paragraph.]\n\n\u201cBecause I have found that that work has been since brought out, and with\na mischievous design, by those who aim at disturbing and changing the\ncondition of our government, without troubling themselves to think\nwhether they are likely to improve it: and because they have mixed up his\nwork with some of their own performance, I have refrained from inserting\nit here.  But that the memory of the author may not be injured, nor\nsuffer with such as could not come near-hand to be acquainted with his\nprinciples, I here give them to understand, that it was written by him in\nhis boyhood, and that by way of exercise only, as a common theme that has\nbeen hackneyed by a thousand writers.  I make no question but that he\nhimself believed what he wrote, being so conscientious that he would not\nso much as lie in jest: and I moreover know, that could it have been in\nhis own choice, he had rather have been born at Venice, than at Sarlac;\nand with reason.  But he had another maxim sovereignty imprinted in his\nsoul, very religiously to obey and submit to the laws under which he was\nborn.  There never was a better citizen, more affectionate to his\ncountry; nor a greater enemy to all the commotions and innovations of his\ntime: so that he would much rather have employed his talent to the\nextinguishing of those civil flames, than have added any fuel to them;\nhe had a mind fashioned to the model of better ages.  Now, in exchange of\nthis serious piece, I will present you with another of a more gay and\nfrolic air, from the same hand, and written at the same age.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\n\nNINE AND TWENTY SONNETS OF ESTIENNE DE LA BOITIE\n\nTO MADAME DE GRAMMONT, COMTESSE DE GUISSEN.\n\n     [They scarce contain anything but amorous complaints, expressed in a\n     very rough style, discovering the follies and outrages of a restless\n     passion, overgorged, as it were, with jealousies, fears and\n     suspicions.--Coste.]\n\n     [These....contained in the edition of 1588 nine-and-twenty sonnets\n     of La Boetie, accompanied by a dedicatory epistle to Madame de\n     Grammont.  The former, which are referred to at the end of Chap.\n     XXVIL, do not really belong to the book, and are of very slight\n     interest at this time; the epistle is transferred to the\n     Correspondence.  The sonnets, with the letter, were presumably sent\n     some time after Letters V. et seq.  Montaigne seems to have had\n     several copies written out to forward to friends or acquaintances.]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX.\n\nOF MODERATION\n\nAs if we had an infectious touch, we, by our manner of handling, corrupt\nthings that in themselves are laudable and good: we may grasp virtue so\nthat it becomes vicious, if we embrace it too stringently and with too\nviolent a desire.  Those who say, there is never any excess in virtue,\nforasmuch as it is not virtue when it once becomes excess, only play upon\nwords:\n\n              \u201cInsani sapiens nomen ferat, aequus iniqui,\n               Ultra quam satis est, virtutem si petat ipsam.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cLet the wise man bear the name of a madman, the just one of an\n     unjust, if he seek wisdom more than is sufficient.\u201d\n      --Horace, Ep., i. 6, 15.]\n\n     [\u201cThe wise man is no longer wise, the just man no longer just, if he\n     seek to carry his love for wisdom or virtue beyond that which is\n     necessary.\u201d]\n\nThis is a subtle consideration of philosophy.  A man may both be too much\nin love with virtue, and be excessive in a just action.  Holy Writ agrees\nwith this, Be not wiser than you should, but be soberly wise.--[St.\nPaul, Epistle to the Romans, xii. 3.]--I have known a great man,\n\n     --[\u201cIt is likely that Montaigne meant Henry III., king of France.\n     The Cardinal d\u2019Ossat, writing to Louise, the queen-dowager, told\n     her, in his frank manner, that he had lived as much or more like a\n     monk than a monarch (Letter XXIII.) And Pope Sextus V., speaking of\n     that prince one day to the Cardinal de Joyeuse, protector of the\n     affairs of France, said to him pleasantly, \u2018There is nothing that\n     your king hath not done, and does not do so still, to be a monk, nor\n     anything that I have not done, not to be a monk.\u2019\u201d--Coste.]\n\nprejudice the opinion men had of his devotion, by pretending to be devout\nbeyond all examples of others of his condition.  I love temperate and\nmoderate natures.  An immoderate zeal, even to that which is good, even\nthough it does not offend, astonishes me, and puts me to study what name\nto give it.  Neither the mother of Pausanias,\n\n     --[\u201cMontaigne would here give us to understand, upon the authority of\n     Diodorus Siculus, that Pausanias\u2019 mother gave the first hint of the\n     punishment that was to be inflicted on her son.  \u2018Pausanias,\u2019 says\n     this historian, \u2018perceiving that the ephori, and some other\n     Lacedoemonians, aimed at apprehending him, got the start of them,\n     and went and took sanctuary m Minerva\u2019s temple: and the\n     Lacedaemonians, being doubtful whether they ought to take him from\n     thence in violation of the franchise there, it is said that his own\n     mother came herself to the temple but spoke nothing nor did anything\n     more than lay a piece of brick, which she brought with her, on the\n     threshold of the temple, which, when she had done, she returned\n     home.  The Lacedaemonians, taking the hint from the mother, caused\n     the gate of the temple to be walled up, and by this means starved\n     Pausanias, so that he died with hunger, &c. (lib. xi. cap. 10., of\n     Amyot\u2019s translation).  The name of Pausanias\u2019 mother was Alcithea,\n     as we are informed by Thucydides\u2019 scholiast, who only says that it\n     was reported, that when they set about walling up the gates of the\n     chapel in which Pausanias had taken refuge, his mother Alcithea laid\n     the first stone.\u201d--Coste.]\n\nwho was the first instructor of her son\u2019s process, and threw the first\nstone towards his death, nor Posthumius the dictator, who put his son to\ndeath, whom the ardour of youth had successfully pushed upon the enemy a\nlittle more advanced than the rest of his squadron, do appear to me so\nmuch just as strange; and I should neither advise nor like to follow so\nsavage a virtue, and that costs so dear.\n\n     --[\u201cOpinions differ as to the truth of this fact.  Livy thinks he\n     has good authority for rejecting it because it does not appear in\n     history that Posthumious was branded with it, as Titus Manlius was,\n     about 100 years after his time; for Manlius, having put his son to\n     death for the like cause, obtained the odious name of Imperiosus,\n     and since that time Manliana imperia has been used as a term to\n     signify orders that are too severe; Manliana Imperia, says Livy,\n     were not only horrible for the time present, but of a bad example to\n     posterity.  And this historian makes no doubt but such commands\n     would have been actually styled Posthumiana Imperia, if Posthumius\n     had been the first who set so barbarous an example (Livy, lib. iv.\n     cap. 29, and lib. viii. cap. 7).  But, however, Montaigne has Valer.\n     Maximus on his side, who says expressly, that Posthumius caused his\n     son to be put to death, and Diodorus of Sicily (lib.  xii.  cap.\n     19).\u201d--Coste.]\n\nThe archer that shoots over, misses as much as he that falls short, and\n\u2018tis equally troublesome to my sight, to look up at a great light, and\nto look down into a dark abyss.  Callicles in Plato says, that the\nextremity of philosophy is hurtful, and advises not to dive into it\nbeyond the limits of profit; that, taken moderately, it is pleasant and\nuseful; but that in the end it renders a man brutish and vicious, a\ncontemner of religion and the common laws, an enemy to civil\nconversation, and all human pleasures, incapable of all public\nadministration, unfit either to assist others or to relieve himself, and\na fit object for all sorts of injuries and affronts.  He says true; for\nin its excess, it enslaves our natural freedom, and by an impertinent\nsubtlety, leads us out of the fair and beaten way that nature has traced\nfor us.\n\nThe love we bear to our wives is very lawful, and yet theology thinks fit\nto curb and restrain it.  As I remember, I have read in one place of St.\nThomas Aquinas,--[Secunda Secundx, Quaest. 154, art. 9.]--where he\ncondemns marriages within any of the forbidden degrees, for this reason,\namongst others, that there is some danger, lest the friendship a man\nbears to such a woman, should be immoderate; for if the conjugal\naffection be full and perfect betwixt them, as it ought to be, and that\nit be over and above surcharged with that of kindred too, there is no\ndoubt, but such an addition will carry the husband beyond the bounds of\nreason.\n\nThose sciences that regulate the manners of men, divinity and philosophy,\nwill have their say in everything; there is no action so private and\nsecret that can escape their inspection and jurisdiction.  They are best\ntaught who are best able to control and curb their own liberty; women\nexpose their nudities as much as you will upon the account of pleasure,\nthough in the necessities of physic they are altogether as shy.  I will,\ntherefore, in their behalf:\n\n     --[Coste translates this: \u201con the part of philosophy and theology,\u201d\n      observing that but few wives would think themselves obliged to\n     Montaigne for any such lesson to their husbands.]--\n\nteach the husbands, that is, such as are too vehement in the exercise of\nthe matrimonial duty--if such there still be--this lesson, that the very\npleasures they enjoy in the society of their wives are reproachable if\nimmoderate, and that a licentious and riotous abuse of them is a fault as\nreprovable here as in illicit connections.  Those immodest and debauched\ntricks and postures, that the first ardour suggests to us in this affair,\nare not only indecently but detrimentally practised upon our wives.  Let\nthem at least learn impudence from another hand; they are ever ready\nenough for our business, and I for my part always went the plain way to\nwork.\n\nMarriage is a solemn and religious tie, and therefore the pleasure we\nextract from it should be a sober and serious delight, and mixed with a\ncertain kind of gravity; it should be a sort of discreet and\nconscientious pleasure.  And seeing that the chief end of it is\ngeneration, some make a question, whether when men are out of hopes as\nwhen they are superannuated or already with child, it be lawful to\nembrace our wives.  \u2018Tis homicide, according to Plato.--[Laws, 8.]--\nCertain nations (the Mohammedan, amongst others) abominate all conjunction\nwith women with child, others also, with those who are in their courses.\nZenobia would never admit her husband for more than one encounter, after\nwhich she left him to his own swing for the whole time of her conception,\nand not till after that would again receive him:--[Trebellius Pollio,\nTriginta Tyran., c. 30.]--a brave and generous example of conjugal\ncontinence.  It was doubtless from some lascivious poet,--[The lascivious\npoet is Homer; see his Iliad, xiv.  294.]--and one that himself was in\ngreat distress for a little of this sport, that Plato borrowed this\nstory; that Jupiter was one day so hot upon his wife, that not having so\nmuch patience as till she could get to the couch, he threw her upon the\nfloor, where the vehemence of pleasure made him forget the great and\nimportant resolutions he had but newly taken with the rest of the gods in\nhis celestial council, and to brag that he had had as good a bout, as\nwhen he got her maidenhead, unknown to their parents.\n\nThe kings of Persia were wont to invite their wives to the beginning of\ntheir festivals; but when the wine began to work in good earnest, and\nthat they were to give the reins to pleasure, they sent them back to\ntheir private apartments, that they might not participate in their\nimmoderate lust, sending for other women in their stead, with whom they\nwere not obliged to so great a decorum of respect.--[Plutarch, Precepts\nof Marriage, c.  14.]--All pleasures and all sorts of gratifications\nare not properly and fitly conferred upon all sorts of persons.\nEpaminondas had committed to prison a young man for certain debauches;\nfor whom Pelopidas mediated, that at his request he might be set at\nliberty, which Epaminondas denied to him, but granted it at the first\nword to a wench of his, that made the same intercession; saying, that it\nwas a gratification fit for such a one as she, but not for a captain.\nSophocles being joint praetor with Pericles, seeing accidentally a fine\nboy pass by: \u201cO what a charming boy is that!\u201d said he.  \u201cThat might be\nvery well,\u201d answered Pericles, \u201cfor any other than a praetor, who ought\nnot only to have his hands, but his eyes, too, chaste.\u201d--[Cicero, De\nOffic., i. 40.]  AElius Verus, the emperor, answered his wife, who\nreproached him with his love to other women, that he did it upon a\nconscientious account, forasmuch as marriage was a name of honour and\ndignity, not of wanton and lascivious desire; and our ecclesiastical\nhistory preserves the memory of that woman in great veneration, who\nparted from her husband because she would not comply with his indecent\nand inordinate desires.  In fine, there is no pleasure so just and\nlawful, where intemperance and excess are not to be condemned.\n\nBut, to speak the truth, is not man a most miserable creature the while?\nIt is scarce, by his natural condition, in his power to taste one\npleasure pure and entire; and yet must he be contriving doctrines and\nprecepts to curtail that little he has; he is not yet wretched enough,\nunless by art and study he augment his own misery:\n\n               \u201cFortunae miseras auximus arte vias.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cWe artificially augment the wretchedness of fortune.\u201d\n      --Properitius, lib. iii. 7, 44.]\n\nHuman wisdom makes as ill use of her talent, when she exercises it in\nrescinding from the number and sweetness of those pleasures that are\nnaturally our due, as she employs it favourably and well in artificially\ndisguising and tricking out the ills of life, to alleviate the sense of\nthem.  Had I ruled the roast, I should have taken another and more\nnatural course, which, to say the truth, is both commodious and holy, and\nshould, peradventure, have been able to have limited it too;\nnotwithstanding that both our spiritual and corporal physicians, as by\ncompact betwixt themselves, can find no other way to cure, nor other\nremedy for the infirmities of the body and the soul, than by misery and\npain.  To this end, watchings, fastings, hair-shirts, remote and solitary\nbanishments, perpetual imprisonments, whips and other afflictions, have\nbeen introduced amongst men: but so, that they should carry a sting with\nthem, and be real afflictions indeed; and not fall out as it once did to\none Gallio, who having been sent an exile into the isle of Lesbos, news\nwas not long after brought to Rome, that he there lived as merry as the\nday was long; and that what had been enjoined him for a penance, turned\nto his pleasure and satisfaction: whereupon the Senate thought fit to\nrecall him home to his wife and family, and confine him to his own house,\nto accommodate their punishment to his feeling and apprehension.  For to\nhim whom fasting would make more healthful and more sprightly, and to him\nto whose palate fish were more acceptable than flesh, the prescription of\nthese would have no curative effect; no more than in the other sort of\nphysic, where drugs have no effect upon him who swallows them with\nappetite and pleasure: the bitterness of the potion and the abhorrence of\nthe patient are necessary circumstances to the operation.  The nature\nthat would eat rhubarb like buttered turnips, would frustrate the use and\nvirtue of it; it must be something to trouble and disturb the stomach,\nthat must purge and cure it; and here the common rule, that things are\ncured by their contraries, fails; for in this one ill is cured by\nanother.\n\nThis belief a little resembles that other so ancient one, of thinking to\ngratify the gods and nature by massacre and murder: an opinion\nuniversally once received in all religions.  And still, in these later\ntimes wherein our fathers lived, Amurath at the taking of the Isthmus,\nimmolated six hundred young Greeks to his father\u2019s soul, in the nature of\na propitiatory sacrifice for his sins.  And in those new countries\ndiscovered in this age of ours, which are pure and virgin yet, in\ncomparison of ours, this practice is in some measure everywhere received:\nall their idols reek with human blood, not without various examples of\nhorrid cruelty: some they burn alive, and take, half broiled, off the\ncoals to tear out their hearts and entrails; some, even women, they flay\nalive, and with their bloody skins clothe and disguise others.  Neither\nare we without great examples of constancy and resolution in this affair\nthe poor souls that are to be sacrificed, old men, women, and children,\nthemselves going about some days before to beg alms for the offering of\ntheir sacrifice, presenting themselves to the slaughter, singing and\ndancing with the spectators.\n\nThe ambassadors of the king of Mexico, setting out to Fernando Cortez the\npower and greatness of their master, after having told him, that he had\nthirty vassals, of whom each was able to raise an hundred thousand\nfighting men, and that he kept his court in the fairest and best\nfortified city under the sun, added at last, that he was obliged yearly\nto offer to the gods fifty thousand men.  And it is affirmed, that he\nmaintained a continual war, with some potent neighbouring nations, not\nonly to keep the young men in exercise, but principally to have\nwherewithal to furnish his sacrifices with his prisoners of war.  At a\ncertain town in another place, for the welcome of the said Cortez, they\nsacrificed fifty men at once.  I will tell you this one tale more, and I\nhave done; some of these people being beaten by him, sent to acknowledge\nhim, and to treat with him of a peace, whose messengers carried him three\nsorts of gifts, which they presented in these terms: \u201cBehold, lord, here\nare five slaves: if thou art a furious god that feedeth upon flesh and\nblood, eat these, and we will bring thee more; if thou art an affable\ngod, behold here incense and feathers; but if thou art a man, take these\nfowls and these fruits that we have brought thee.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX\n\nOF CANNIBALS\n\nWhen King Pyrrhus invaded Italy, having viewed and considered the order\nof the army the Romans sent out to meet him; \u201cI know not,\u201d said he,\n\u201cwhat kind of barbarians\u201d (for so the Greeks called all other nations)\n\u201cthese may be; but the disposition of this army that I see has nothing of\nbarbarism in it.\u201d--[Plutarch, Life of Pyrrhus, c. 8.]--As much said the\nGreeks of that which Flaminius brought into their country; and Philip,\nbeholding from an eminence the order and distribution of the Roman camp\nformed in his kingdom by Publius Sulpicius Galba, spake to the same\neffect.  By which it appears how cautious men ought to be of taking\nthings upon trust from vulgar opinion, and that we are to judge by the\neye of reason, and not from common report.\n\nI long had a man in my house that lived ten or twelve years in the New\nWorld, discovered in these latter days, and in that part of it where\nVillegaignon landed,--[At Brazil, in 1557.]--which he called Antarctic\nFrance.  This discovery of so vast a country seems to be of very great\nconsideration.  I cannot be sure, that hereafter there may not be\nanother, so many wiser men than we having been deceived in this.  I am\nafraid our eyes are bigger than our bellies, and that we have more\ncuriosity than capacity; for we grasp at all, but catch nothing but wind.\n\nPlato brings in Solon,--[In Timaeus.]--telling a story that he had\nheard from the priests of Sais in Egypt, that of old, and before the\nDeluge, there was a great island called Atlantis, situate directly at the\nmouth of the straits of Gibraltar, which contained more countries than\nboth Africa and Asia put together; and that the kings of that country,\nwho not only possessed that Isle, but extended their dominion so far into\nthe continent that they had a country of Africa as far as Egypt, and\nextending in Europe to Tuscany, attempted to encroach even upon Asia, and\nto subjugate all the nations that border upon the Mediterranean Sea, as\nfar as the Black Sea; and to that effect overran all Spain, the Gauls,\nand Italy, so far as to penetrate into Greece, where the Athenians\nstopped them: but that some time after, both the Athenians, and they and\ntheir island, were swallowed by the Flood.\n\nIt is very likely that this extreme irruption and inundation of water\nmade wonderful changes and alterations in the habitations of the earth,\nas \u2018tis said that the sea then divided Sicily from Italy--\n\n         \u201cHaec loca, vi quondam et vasta convulsa ruina,\n          Dissiluisse ferunt, quum protenus utraque tellus\n          Una foret\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThese lands, they say, formerly with violence and vast desolation\n     convulsed, burst asunder, where erewhile were.\u201d--AEneid, iii. 414.]\n\nCyprus from Syria, the isle of Negropont from the continent of Beeotia,\nand elsewhere united lands that were separate before, by filling up the\nchannel betwixt them with sand and mud:\n\n              \u201cSterilisque diu palus, aptaque remis,\n               Vicinas urbes alit, et grave sentit aratrum.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThat which was once a sterile marsh, and bore vessels on its\n     bosom, now feeds neighbouring cities, and admits the plough.\u201d\n      --Horace, De Arte Poetica, v. 65.]\n\nBut there is no great appearance that this isle was this New World so\nlately discovered: for that almost touched upon Spain, and it were an\nincredible effect of an inundation, to have tumbled back so prodigious a\nmass, above twelve hundred leagues: besides that our modern navigators\nhave already almost discovered it to be no island, but terra firma, and\ncontinent with the East Indies on the one side, and with the lands under\nthe two poles on the other side; or, if it be separate from them, it is\nby so narrow a strait and channel, that it none the more deserves the\nname of an island for that.\n\nIt should seem, that in this great body, there are two sorts of motions,\nthe one natural and the other febrific, as there are in ours.  When I\nconsider the impression that our river of Dordogne has made in my time on\nthe right bank of its descent, and that in twenty years it has gained so\nmuch, and undermined the foundations of so many houses, I perceive it to\nbe an extraordinary agitation: for had it always followed this course,\nor were hereafter to do it, the aspect of the world would be totally\nchanged.  But rivers alter their course, sometimes beating against the\none side, and sometimes the other, and some times quietly keeping the\nchannel.  I do not speak of sudden inundations, the causes of which\neverybody understands.  In Medoc, by the seashore, the Sieur d\u2019Arsac, my\nbrother, sees an estate he had there, buried under the sands which the\nsea vomits before it: where the tops of some houses are yet to be seen,\nand where his rents and domains are converted into pitiful barren\npasturage.  The inhabitants of this place affirm, that of late years the\nsea has driven so vehemently upon them, that they have lost above four\nleagues of land.  These sands are her harbingers: and we now see great\nheaps of moving sand, that march half a league before her, and occupy the\nland.\n\nThe other testimony from antiquity, to which some would apply this\ndiscovery of the New World, is in Aristotle; at least, if that little\nbook of Unheard of Miracles be his--[one of the spurious publications\nbrought out under his name--D.W.].  He there tells us, that certain\nCarthaginians, having crossed the Atlantic Sea without the Straits of\nGibraltar, and sailed a very long time, discovered at last a great and\nfruitful island, all covered over with wood, and watered with several\nbroad and deep rivers, far remote from all terra firma; and that they,\nand others after them, allured by the goodness and fertility of the soil,\nwent thither with their wives and children, and began to plant a colony.\nBut the senate of Carthage perceiving their people by little and little\nto diminish, issued out an express prohibition, that none, upon pain of\ndeath, should transport themselves thither; and also drove out these new\ninhabitants; fearing, \u2018tis said, lest\u2019 in process of time they should so\nmultiply as to supplant themselves and ruin their state.  But this\nrelation of Aristotle no more agrees with our new-found lands than the\nother.\n\nThis man that I had was a plain ignorant fellow, and therefore the more\nlikely to tell truth: for your better-bred sort of men are much more\ncurious in their observation, \u2018tis true, and discover a great deal more;\nbut then they gloss upon it, and to give the greater weight to what they\ndeliver, and allure your belief, they cannot forbear a little to alter\nthe story; they never represent things to you simply as they are, but\nrather as they appeared to them, or as they would have them appear to\nyou, and to gain the reputation of men of judgment, and the better to\ninduce your faith, are willing to help out the business with something\nmore than is really true, of their own invention.  Now in this case, we\nshould either have a man of irreproachable veracity, or so simple that he\nhas not wherewithal to contrive, and to give a colour of truth to false\nrelations, and who can have no ends in forging an untruth.  Such a one\nwas mine; and besides, he has at divers times brought to me several\nseamen and merchants who at the same time went the same voyage.  I shall\ntherefore content myself with his information, without inquiring what the\ncosmographers say to the business.  We should have topographers to trace\nout to us the particular places where they have been; but for having had\nthis advantage over us, to have seen the Holy Land, they would have the\nprivilege, forsooth, to tell us stories of all the other parts of the\nworld beside.  I would have every one write what he knows, and as much as\nhe knows, but no more; and that not in this only but in all other\nsubjects; for such a person may have some particular knowledge and\nexperience of the nature of such a river, or such a fountain, who, as to\nother things, knows no more than what everybody does, and yet to give a\ncurrency to his little pittance of learning, will undertake to write the\nwhole body of physics: a vice from which great inconveniences derive\ntheir original.\n\nNow, to return to my subject, I find that there is nothing barbarous and\nsavage in this nation, by anything that I can gather, excepting, that\nevery one gives the title of barbarism to everything that is not in use\nin his own country.  As, indeed, we have no other level of truth and\nreason than the example and idea of the opinions and customs of the place\nwherein we live: there is always the perfect religion, there the perfect\ngovernment, there the most exact and accomplished usage of all things.\nThey are savages at the same rate that we say fruits are wild, which\nnature produces of herself and by her own ordinary progress; whereas, in\ntruth, we ought rather to call those wild whose natures we have changed\nby our artifice and diverted from the common order.  In those, the\ngenuine, most useful, and natural virtues and properties are vigorous and\nsprightly, which we have helped to degenerate in these, by accommodating\nthem to the pleasure of our own corrupted palate.  And yet for all this,\nour taste confesses a flavour and delicacy excellent even to emulation of\nthe best of ours, in several fruits wherein those countries abound\nwithout art or culture.  Neither is it reasonable that art should gain\nthe pre-eminence of our great and powerful mother nature.  We have so\nsurcharged her with the additional ornaments and graces we have added to\nthe beauty and riches of her own works by our inventions, that we have\nalmost smothered her; yet in other places, where she shines in her own\npurity and proper lustre, she marvellously baffles and disgraces all our\nvain and frivolous attempts:\n\n              \u201cEt veniunt hederae sponte sua melius;\n               Surgit et in solis formosior arbutus antris;\n               Et volucres nulls dulcius arte canunt.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThe ivy grows best spontaneously, the arbutus best in shady caves;\n     and the wild notes of birds are sweeter than art can teach.\n     --\u201cPropertius, i. 2, 10.]\n\nOur utmost endeavours cannot arrive at so much as to imitate the nest of\nthe least of birds, its contexture, beauty, and convenience: not so much\nas the web of a poor spider.\n\nAll things, says Plato,--[Laws, 10.]--are produced either by nature, by\nfortune, or by art; the greatest and most beautiful by the one or the\nother of the former, the least and the most imperfect by the last.\n\nThese nations then seem to me to be so far barbarous, as having received\nbut very little form and fashion from art and human invention, and\nconsequently to be not much remote from their original simplicity.  The\nlaws of nature, however, govern them still, not as yet much vitiated with\nany mixture of ours: but \u2018tis in such purity, that I am sometimes\ntroubled we were not sooner acquainted with these people, and that they\nwere not discovered in those better times, when there were men much more\nable to judge of them than we are.  I am sorry that Lycurgus and Plato\nhad no knowledge of them; for to my apprehension, what we now see in\nthose nations, does not only surpass all the pictures with which the\npoets have adorned the golden age, and all their inventions in feigning a\nhappy state of man, but, moreover, the fancy and even the wish and desire\nof philosophy itself; so native and so pure a simplicity, as we by\nexperience see to be in them, could never enter into their imagination,\nnor could they ever believe that human society could have been maintained\nwith so little artifice and human patchwork.  I should tell Plato that it\nis a nation wherein there is no manner of traffic, no knowledge of\nletters, no science of numbers, no name of magistrate or political\nsuperiority; no use of service, riches or poverty, no contracts, no\nsuccessions, no dividends, no properties, no employments, but those of\nleisure, no respect of kindred, but common, no clothing, no agriculture,\nno metal, no use of corn or wine; the very words that signify lying,\ntreachery, dissimulation, avarice, envy, detraction, pardon, never heard\nof.\n\n     --[This is the famous passage which Shakespeare, through Florio\u2019s\n     version, 1603, or ed.  1613, p. 102, has employed in the \u201cTempest,\u201d\n      ii. 1.]\n\nHow much would he find his imaginary Republic short of his perfection?\n\n                    \u201cViri a diis recentes.\u201d\n\n          [\u201cMen fresh from the gods.\u201d--Seneca, Ep., 90.]\n\n               \u201cHos natura modos primum dedit.\u201d\n\n          [\u201cThese were the manners first taught by nature.\u201d\n           --Virgil, Georgics, ii. 20.]\n\nAs to the rest, they live in a country very pleasant and temperate, so\nthat, as my witnesses inform me, \u2018tis rare to hear of a sick person, and\nthey moreover assure me, that they never saw any of the natives, either\nparalytic, bleareyed, toothless, or crooked with age.  The situation of\ntheir country is along the sea-shore, enclosed on the other side towards\nthe land, with great and high mountains, having about a hundred leagues\nin breadth between.  They have great store of fish and flesh, that have\nno resemblance to those of ours: which they eat without any other\ncookery, than plain boiling, roasting, and broiling.  The first that rode\na horse thither, though in several other voyages he had contracted an\nacquaintance and familiarity with them, put them into so terrible a\nfright, with his centaur appearance, that they killed him with their\narrows before they could come to discover who he was.  Their buildings\nare very long, and of capacity to hold two or three hundred people, made\nof the barks of tall trees, reared with one end upon the ground, and\nleaning to and supporting one another at the top, like some of our barns,\nof which the covering hangs down to the very ground, and serves for the\nside walls. They have wood so hard, that they cut with it, and make their\nswords of it, and their grills of it to broil their meat.  Their beds are\nof cotton, hung swinging from the roof, like our seamen\u2019s hammocks, every\nman his own, for the wives lie apart from their husbands.  They rise with\nthe sun, and so soon as they are up, eat for all day, for they have no\nmore meals but that; they do not then drink, as Suidas reports of some\nother people of the East that never drank at their meals; but drink very\noften all day after, and sometimes to a rousing pitch.  Their drink is\nmade of a certain root, and is of the colour of our claret, and they\nnever drink it but lukewarm.  It will not keep above two or three days;\nit has a somewhat sharp, brisk taste, is nothing heady, but very\ncomfortable to the stomach; laxative to strangers, but a very pleasant\nbeverage to such as are accustomed to it.  They make use, instead of\nbread, of a certain white compound, like coriander seeds; I have tasted\nof it; the taste is sweet and a little flat.  The whole day is spent in\ndancing.  Their young men go a-hunting after wild beasts with bows and\narrows; one part of their women are employed in preparing their drink the\nwhile, which is their chief employment.  One of their old men, in the\nmorning before they fall to eating, preaches to the whole family, walking\nfrom the one end of the house to the other, and several times repeating\nthe same sentence, till he has finished the round, for their houses are\nat least a hundred yards long.  Valour towards their enemies and love\ntowards their wives, are the two heads of his discourse, never failing in\nthe close, to put them in mind, that \u2018tis their wives who provide them\ntheir drink warm and well seasoned.  The fashion of their beds, ropes,\nswords, and of the wooden bracelets they tie about their wrists, when\nthey go to fight, and of the great canes, bored hollow at one end, by the\nsound of which they keep the cadence of their dances, are to be seen in\nseveral places, and amongst others, at my house.  They shave all over,\nand much more neatly than we, without other razor than one of wood or\nstone.  They believe in the immortality of the soul, and that those who\nhave merited well of the gods are lodged in that part of heaven where the\nsun rises, and the accursed in the west.\n\nThey have I know not what kind of priests and prophets, who very rarely\npresent themselves to the people, having their abode in the mountains.\nAt their arrival, there is a great feast, and solemn assembly of many\nvillages: each house, as I have described, makes a village, and they are\nabout a French league distant from one another.  This prophet declaims to\nthem in public, exhorting them to virtue and their duty: but all their\nethics are comprised in these two articles, resolution in war, and\naffection to their wives.  He also prophesies to them events to come, and\nthe issues they are to expect from their enterprises, and prompts them to\nor diverts them from war: but let him look to\u2019t; for if he fail in his\ndivination, and anything happen otherwise than he has foretold, he is cut\ninto a thousand pieces, if he be caught, and condemned for a false\nprophet: for that reason, if any of them has been mistaken, he is no more\nheard of.\n\nDivination is a gift of God, and therefore to abuse it, ought to be a\npunishable imposture.  Amongst the Scythians, where their diviners failed\nin the promised effect, they were laid, bound hand and foot, upon carts\nloaded with firs and bavins, and drawn by oxen, on which they were burned\nto death.--[Herodotus, iv.  69.]--Such as only meddle with things\nsubject to the conduct of human capacity, are excusable in doing the best\nthey can: but those other fellows that come to delude us with assurances\nof an extraordinary faculty, beyond our understanding, ought they not to\nbe punished, when they do not make good the effect of their promise, and\nfor the temerity of their imposture?\n\nThey have continual war with the nations that live further within the\nmainland, beyond their mountains, to which they go naked, and without\nother arms than their bows and wooden swords, fashioned at one end like\nthe head of our javelins.  The obstinacy of their battles is wonderful,\nand they never end without great effusion of blood: for as to running\naway, they know not what it is.  Every one for a trophy brings home the\nhead of an enemy he has killed, which he fixes over the door of his\nhouse.  After having a long time treated their prisoners very well, and\ngiven them all the regales they can think of, he to whom the prisoner\nbelongs, invites a great assembly of his friends.  They being come, he\nties a rope to one of the arms of the prisoner, of which, at a distance,\nout of his reach, he holds the one end himself, and gives to the friend\nhe loves best the other arm to hold after the same manner; which being.\ndone, they two, in the presence of all the assembly, despatch him with\ntheir swords.  After that, they roast him, eat him amongst them, and send\nsome chops to their absent friends.  They do not do this, as some think,\nfor nourishment, as the Scythians anciently did, but as a representation\nof an extreme revenge; as will appear by this: that having observed the\nPortuguese, who were in league with their enemies, to inflict another\nsort of death upon any of them they took prisoners, which was to set them\nup to the girdle in the earth, to shoot at the remaining part till it was\nstuck full of arrows, and then to hang them, they thought those people of\nthe other world (as being men who had sown the knowledge of a great many\nvices amongst their neighbours, and who were much greater masters in all\nsorts of mischief than they) did not exercise this sort of revenge\nwithout a meaning, and that it must needs be more painful than theirs,\nthey began to leave their old way, and to follow this.  I am not sorry\nthat we should here take notice of the barbarous horror of so cruel an\naction, but that, seeing so clearly into their faults, we should be so\nblind to our own.  I conceive there is more barbarity in eating a man\nalive, than when he is dead; in tearing a body limb from limb by racks\nand torments, that is yet in perfect sense; in roasting it by degrees; in\ncausing it to be bitten and worried by dogs and swine (as we have not\nonly read, but lately seen, not amongst inveterate and mortal enemies,\nbut among neighbours and fellow-citizens, and, which is worse, under\ncolour of piety and religion), than to roast and eat him after he is\ndead.\n\nChrysippus and Zeno, the two heads of the Stoic sect, were of opinion\nthat there was no hurt in making use of our dead carcasses, in what way\nsoever for our necessity, and in feeding upon them too;--[Diogenes\nLaertius, vii.  188.]--as our own ancestors, who being besieged by\nCaesar in the city Alexia, resolved to sustain the famine of the siege\nwith the bodies of their old men, women, and other persons who were\nincapable of bearing arms.\n\n              \u201cVascones, ut fama est, alimentis talibus usi\n               Produxere animas.\u201d\n\n     [\u201c\u2018Tis said the Gascons with such meats appeased their hunger.\u201d\n      --Juvenal, Sat., xv. 93.]\n\nAnd the physicians make no bones of employing it to all sorts of use,\neither to apply it outwardly; or to give it inwardly for the health of\nthe patient.  But there never was any opinion so irregular, as to excuse\ntreachery, disloyalty, tyranny, and cruelty, which are our familiar\nvices.  We may then call these people barbarous, in respect to the rules\nof reason: but not in respect to ourselves, who in all sorts of barbarity\nexceed them.  Their wars are throughout noble and generous, and carry as\nmuch excuse and fair pretence, as that human malady is capable of; having\nwith them no other foundation than the sole jealousy of valour.  Their\ndisputes are not for the conquest of new lands, for these they already\npossess are so fruitful by nature, as to supply them without labour or\nconcern, with all things necessary, in such abundance that they have no\nneed to enlarge their borders.  And they are, moreover, happy in this,\nthat they only covet so much as their natural necessities require: all\nbeyond that is superfluous to them: men of the same age call one another\ngenerally brothers, those who are younger, children; and the old men are\nfathers to all.  These leave to their heirs in common the full possession\nof goods, without any manner of division, or other title than what nature\nbestows upon her creatures, in bringing them into the world.  If their\nneighbours pass over the mountains to assault them, and obtain a victory,\nall the victors gain by it is glory only, and the advantage of having\nproved themselves the better in valour and virtue: for they never meddle\nwith the goods of the conquered, but presently return into their own\ncountry, where they have no want of anything necessary, nor of this\ngreatest of all goods, to know happily how to enjoy their condition and\nto be content.  And those in turn do the same; they demand of their\nprisoners no other ransom, than acknowledgment that they are overcome:\nbut there is not one found in an age, who will not rather choose to die\nthan make such a confession, or either by word or look recede from the\nentire grandeur of an invincible courage.  There is not a man amongst\nthem who had not rather be killed and eaten, than so much as to open his\nmouth to entreat he may not.  They use them with all liberality and\nfreedom, to the end their lives may be so much the dearer to them; but\nfrequently entertain them with menaces of their approaching death, of the\ntorments they are to suffer, of the preparations making in order to it,\nof the mangling their limbs, and of the feast that is to be made, where\ntheir carcass is to be the only dish.  All which they do, to no other\nend, but only to extort some gentle or submissive word from them, or to\nfrighten them so as to make them run away, to obtain this advantage that\nthey were terrified, and that their constancy was shaken; and indeed, if\nrightly taken, it is in this point only that a true victory consists:\n\n                              \u201cVictoria nulla est,\n          Quam quae confessor animo quoque subjugat hostes.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cNo victory is complete, which the conquered do not admit to be\n     so.--\u201cClaudius, De Sexto Consulatu Honorii, v. 248.]\n\nThe Hungarians, a very warlike people, never pretend further than to\nreduce the enemy to their discretion; for having forced this confession\nfrom them, they let them go without injury or ransom, excepting, at the\nmost, to make them engage their word never to bear arms against them\nagain.  We have sufficient advantages over our enemies that are borrowed\nand not truly our own; it is the quality of a porter, and no effect of\nvirtue, to have stronger arms and legs; it is a dead and corporeal\nquality to set in array; \u2018tis a turn of fortune to make our enemy\nstumble, or to dazzle him with the light of the sun; \u2018tis a trick of\nscience and art, and that may happen in a mean base fellow, to be a good\nfencer.  The estimate and value of a man consist in the heart and in the\nwill: there his true honour lies.  Valour is stability, not of legs and\narms, but of the courage and the soul; it does not lie in the goodness of\nour horse or our arms but in our own.  He that falls obstinate in his\ncourage--\n\n                    \u201cSi succiderit, de genu pugnat\u201d\n\n          [\u201cIf his legs fail him, he fights on his knees.\u201d\n           --Seneca, De Providentia, c. 2.]\n\n--he who, for any danger of imminent death, abates nothing of his\nassurance; who, dying, yet darts at his enemy a fierce and disdainful\nlook, is overcome not by us, but by fortune; he is killed, not conquered;\nthe most valiant are sometimes the most unfortunate.  There are defeats\nmore triumphant than victories.  Never could those four sister victories,\nthe fairest the sun ever be held, of Salamis, Plataea, Mycale, and\nSicily, venture to oppose all their united glories, to the single glory\nof the discomfiture of King Leonidas and his men, at the pass of\nThermopylae.  Who ever ran with a more glorious desire and greater\nambition, to the winning, than Captain Iscolas to the certain loss of a\nbattle?--[Diodorus Siculus, xv.  64.]--Who could have found out a more\nsubtle invention to secure his safety, than he did to assure his\ndestruction?  He was set to defend a certain pass of Peloponnesus against\nthe Arcadians, which, considering the nature of the place and the\ninequality of forces, finding it utterly impossible for him to do, and\nseeing that all who were presented to the enemy, must certainly be left\nupon the place; and on the other side, reputing it unworthy of his own\nvirtue and magnanimity and of the Lacedaemonian name to fail in any part\nof his duty, he chose a mean betwixt these two extremes after this\nmanner; the youngest and most active of his men, he preserved for the\nservice and defence of their country, and sent them back; and with the\nrest, whose loss would be of less consideration, he resolved to make good\nthe pass, and with the death of them, to make the enemy buy their entry\nas dear as possibly he could; as it fell out, for being presently\nenvironed on all sides by the Arcadians, after having made a great\nslaughter of the enemy, he and his were all cut in pieces.  Is there any\ntrophy dedicated to the conquerors which was not much more due to these\nwho were overcome?  The part that true conquering is to play, lies in the\nencounter, not in the coming off; and the honour of valour consists in\nfighting, not in subduing.\n\nBut to return to my story: these prisoners are so far from discovering\nthe least weakness, for all the terrors that can be represented to them,\nthat, on the contrary, during the two or three months they are kept, they\nalways appear with a cheerful countenance; importune their masters to\nmake haste to bring them to the test, defy, rail at them, and reproach\nthem with cowardice, and the number of battles they have lost against\nthose of their country.  I have a song made by one of these prisoners,\nwherein he bids them \u201ccome all, and dine upon him, and welcome, for they\nshall withal eat their own fathers and grandfathers, whose flesh has\nserved to feed and nourish him.  These muscles,\u201d says he, \u201cthis flesh and\nthese veins, are your own: poor silly souls as you are, you little think\nthat the substance of your ancestors\u2019 limbs is here yet; notice what you\neat, and you will find in it the taste of your own flesh:\u201d in which song\nthere is to be observed an invention that nothing relishes of the\nbarbarian.  Those that paint these people dying after this manner,\nrepresent the prisoner spitting in the faces of his executioners and\nmaking wry mouths at them.  And \u2018tis most certain, that to the very last\ngasp, they never cease to brave and defy them both in word and gesture.\nIn plain truth, these men are very savage in comparison of us; of\nnecessity, they must either be absolutely so or else we are savages; for\nthere is a vast difference betwixt their manners and ours.\n\nThe men there have several wives, and so much the greater number, by how\nmuch they have the greater reputation for valour.  And it is one very\nremarkable feature in their marriages, that the same jealousy our wives\nhave to hinder and divert us from the friendship and familiarity of other\nwomen, those employ to promote their husbands\u2019 desires, and to procure\nthem many spouses; for being above all things solicitous of their\nhusbands\u2019 honour, \u2018tis their chiefest care to seek out, and to bring in\nthe most companions they can, forasmuch as it is a testimony of the\nhusband\u2019s virtue.  Most of our ladies will cry out, that \u2018tis monstrous;\nwhereas in truth it is not so, but a truly matrimonial virtue, and of the\nhighest form.  In the Bible, Sarah, with Leah and Rachel, the two wives\nof Jacob, gave the most beautiful of their handmaids to their husbands;\nLivia preferred the passions of Augustus to her own interest;\n--[Suetonius, Life of Augustus, c. 71.]--and the wife of King Deiotarus,\nStratonice, did not only give up a fair young maid that served her to her\nhusband\u2019s embraces, but moreover carefully brought up the children he had\nby her, and assisted them in the succession to their father\u2019s crown.\n\nAnd that it may not be supposed, that all this is done by a simple and\nservile obligation to their common practice, or by any authoritative\nimpression of their ancient custom, without judgment or reasoning, and\nfrom having a soul so stupid that it cannot contrive what else to do, I\nmust here give you some touches of their sufficiency in point of\nunderstanding.  Besides what I repeated to you before, which was one of\ntheir songs of war, I have another, a love-song, that begins thus:\n\n     \u201cStay, adder, stay, that by thy pattern my sister may draw the\n     fashion and work of a rich ribbon, that I may present to my beloved,\n     by which means thy beauty and the excellent order of thy scales\n     shall for ever be preferred before all other serpents.\u201d\n\nWherein the first couplet, \u201cStay, adder,\u201d &c., makes the burden of the\nsong.  Now I have conversed enough with poetry to judge thus much that\nnot only there is nothing barbarous in this invention, but, moreover,\nthat it is perfectly Anacreontic.  To which it may be added, that their\nlanguage is soft, of a pleasing accent, and something bordering upon the\nGreek termination.\n\nThree of these people, not foreseeing how dear their knowledge of the\ncorruptions of this part of the world will one day cost their happiness\nand repose, and that the effect of this commerce will be their ruin, as I\npresuppose it is in a very fair way (miserable men to suffer themselves\nto be deluded with desire of novelty and to have left the serenity of\ntheir own heaven to come so far to gaze at ours!), were at Rouen at the\ntime that the late King Charles IX. was there.  The king himself talked\nto them a good while, and they were made to see our fashions, our pomp,\nand the form of a great city.  After which, some one asked their opinion,\nand would know of them, what of all the things they had seen, they found\nmost to be admired?  To which they made answer, three things, of which I\nhave forgotten the third, and am troubled at it, but two I yet remember.\nThey said, that in the first place they thought it very strange that so\nmany tall men, wearing beards, strong, and well armed, who were about the\nking (\u2018tis like they meant the Swiss of the guard), should submit to obey\na child, and that they did not rather choose out one amongst themselves\nto command.  Secondly (they have a way of speaking in their language to\ncall men the half of one another), that they had observed that there were\namongst us men full and crammed with all manner of commodities, whilst,\nin the meantime, their halves were begging at their doors, lean and\nhalf-starved with hunger and poverty; and they thought it strange that\nthese necessitous halves were able to suffer so great an inequality and\ninjustice, and that they did not take the others by the throats, or set\nfire to their houses.\n\nI talked to one of them a great while together, but I had so ill an\ninterpreter, and one who was so perplexed by his own ignorance to\napprehend my meaning, that I could get nothing out of him of any moment:\nAsking him what advantage he reaped from the superiority he had amongst\nhis own people (for he was a captain, and our mariners called him king),\nhe told me, to march at the head of them to war.  Demanding of him\nfurther how many men he had to follow him, he showed me a space of\nground, to signify as many as could march in such a compass, which might\nbe four or five thousand men; and putting the question to him whether or\nno his authority expired with the war, he told me this remained: that\nwhen he went to visit the villages of his dependence, they planed him\npaths through the thick of their woods, by which he might pass at his\nease.  All this does not sound very ill, and the last was not at all\namiss, for they wear no breeches.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI\n\nTHAT A MAN IS SOBERLY TO JUDGE OF THE DIVINE ORDINANCES\n\nThe true field and subject of imposture are things unknown, forasmuch as,\nin the first place, their very strangeness lends them credit, and\nmoreover, by not being subjected to our ordinary reasons, they deprive us\nof the means to question and dispute them: For which reason, says Plato,\n--[In Critias.]--it is much more easy to satisfy the hearers, when\nspeaking of the nature of the gods than of the nature of men, because the\nignorance of the auditory affords a fair and large career and all manner\nof liberty in the handling of abstruse things.  Thence it comes to pass,\nthat nothing is so firmly believed, as what we least know; nor any people\nso confident, as those who entertain us with fables, such as your\nalchemists, judicial astrologers, fortune-tellers, and physicians,\n\n                         \u201cId genus omne.\u201d\n\n          [\u201cAll that sort of people.\u201d--Horace, Sat., i. 2, 2.]\n\nTo which I would willingly, if I durst, join a pack of people that take\nupon them to interpret and control the designs of God Himself, pretending\nto find out the cause of every accident, and to pry into the secrets of\nthe divine will, there to discover the incomprehensible motive, of His\nworks; and although the variety, and the continual discordance of events,\nthrow them from corner to corner, and toss them from east to west, yet do\nthey still persist in their vain inquisition, and with the same pencil to\npaint black and white.\n\nIn a nation of the Indies, there is this commendable custom, that when\nanything befalls them amiss in any encounter or battle, they publicly ask\npardon of the sun, who is their god, as having committed an unjust\naction, always imputing their good or evil fortune to the divine justice,\nand to that submitting their own judgment and reason.  \u2018Tis enough for a\nChristian to believe that all things come from God, to receive them with\nacknowledgment of His divine and inscrutable wisdom, and also thankfully\nto accept and receive them, with what face soever they may present\nthemselves.  But I do not approve of what I see in use, that is, to seek\nto affirm and support our religion by the prosperity of our enterprises.\nOur belief has other foundation enough, without going about to authorise\nit by events: for the people being accustomed to such plausible arguments\nas these and so proper to their taste, it is to be feared, lest when they\nfail of success they should also stagger in their faith: as in the war\nwherein we are now engaged upon the account of religion, those who had\nthe better in the business of Rochelabeille,--[May 1569.]--making great\nbrags of that success as an infallible approbation of their cause, when\nthey came afterwards to excuse their misfortunes of Moncontour and\nJarnac, by saying they were fatherly scourges and corrections that they\nhad not a people wholly at their mercy, they make it manifestly enough\nappear, what it is to take two sorts of grist out of the same sack, and\nwith the same mouth to blow hot and cold.  It were better to possess the\nvulgar with the solid and real foundations of truth.  \u2018Twas a fine naval\nbattle that was gained under the command of Don John of Austria a few\nmonths since--[That of Lepanto, October 7, 1571.]--against the Turks;\nbut it has also pleased God at other times to let us see as great\nvictories at our own expense.  In fine, \u2018tis a hard matter to reduce\ndivine things to our balance, without waste and losing a great deal of\nthe weight.  And who would take upon him to give a reason that Arius and\nhis Pope Leo, the principal heads of the Arian heresy, should die, at\nseveral times, of so like and strange deaths (for being withdrawn from\nthe disputation by a griping in the bowels, they both of them suddenly\ngave up the ghost upon the stool), and would aggravate this divine\nvengeance by the circumstances of the place, might as well add the death\nof Heliogabalus, who was also slain in a house of office.  And, indeed,\nIrenaeus was involved in the same fortune.  God, being pleased to show\nus, that the good have something else to hope for and the wicked\nsomething else to fear, than the fortunes or misfortunes of this world,\nmanages and applies these according to His own occult will and pleasure,\nand deprives us of the means foolishly to make thereof our own profit.\nAnd those people abuse themselves who will pretend to dive into these\nmysteries by the strength of human reason.  They never give one hit that\nthey do not receive two for it; of which St. Augustine makes out a great\nproof upon his adversaries.  \u2018Tis a conflict that is more decided by\nstrength of memory than by the force of reason.  We are to content\nourselves with the light it pleases the sun to communicate to us, by\nvirtue of his rays; and who will lift up his eyes to take in a greater,\nlet him not think it strange, if for the reward of his presumption, he\nthere lose his sight.\n\n               \u201cQuis hominum potest scire consilium Dei?\n               Aut quis poterit cogitare quid velit Dominus?\u201d\n\n     [\u201cWho of men can know the counsel of God? or who can think what the\n     will of the Lord is.\u201d--Book of Wisdom, ix. 13.]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII\n\nTHAT WE ARE TO AVOID PLEASURES, EVEN AT THE EXPENSE OF LIFE\n\nI had long ago observed most of the opinions of the ancients to concur in\nthis, that it is high time to die when there is more ill than good in\nliving, and that to preserve life to our own torment and inconvenience is\ncontrary to the very rules of nature, as these old laws instruct us.\n\n     [\u201cEither tranquil life, or happy death.  It is well to die when life\n     is wearisome.  It is better to die than to live miserable.\u201d\n      --Stobaeus, Serm. xx.]\n\nBut to push this contempt of death so far as to employ it to the removing\nour thoughts from the honours, riches, dignities, and other favours and\ngoods, as we call them, of fortune, as if reason were not sufficient to\npersuade us to avoid them, without adding this new injunction, I had\nnever seen it either commanded or practised, till this passage of Seneca\nfell into my hands; who advising Lucilius, a man of great power and\nauthority about the emperor, to alter his voluptuous and magnificent way\nof living, and to retire himself from this worldly vanity and ambition,\nto some solitary, quiet, and philosophical life, and the other alleging\nsome difficulties: \u201cI am of opinion,\u201d says he, \u201ceither that thou leave\nthat life of thine, or life itself; I would, indeed, advise thee to the\ngentle way, and to untie, rather than to break, the knot thou hast\nindiscreetly knit, provided, that if it be not otherwise to be untied,\nthou resolutely break it.  There is no man so great a coward, that had\nnot rather once fall than to be always falling.\u201d  I should have found\nthis counsel conformable enough to the Stoical roughness: but it appears\nthe more strange, for being borrowed from Epicurus, who writes the same\nthing upon the like occasion to Idomeneus.  And I think I have observed\nsomething like it, but with Christian moderation, amongst our own people.\n\nSt. Hilary, Bishop of Poictiers, that famous enemy of the Arian heresy,\nbeing in Syria, had intelligence thither sent him, that Abra, his only\ndaughter, whom he left at home under the eye and tuition of her mother,\nwas sought in marriage by the greatest noblemen of the country, as being\na virgin virtuously brought up, fair, rich, and in the flower of her age;\nwhereupon he wrote to her (as appears upon record), that she should\nremove her affection from all the pleasures and advantages proposed to\nher; for that he had in his travels found out a much greater and more\nworthy fortune for her, a husband of much greater power and magnificence,\nwho would present her with robes and jewels of inestimable value; wherein\nhis design was to dispossess her of the appetite and use of worldly\ndelights, to join her wholly to God; but the nearest and most certain way\nto this, being, as he conceived, the death of his daughter; he never\nceased, by vows, prayers, and orisons, to beg of the Almighty, that He\nwould please to call her out of this world, and to take her to Himself;\nas accordingly it came to pass; for soon after his return, she died, at\nwhich he expressed a singular joy.  This seems to outdo the other,\nforasmuch as he applies himself to this means at the outset, which they\nonly take subsidiarily; and, besides, it was towards his only daughter.\nBut I will not omit the latter end of this story, though it be for my\npurpose; St. Hilary\u2019s wife, having understood from him how the death of\ntheir daughter was brought about by his desire and design, and how much\nhappier she was to be removed out of this world than to have stayed in\nit, conceived so vivid an apprehension of the eternal and heavenly\nbeatitude, that she begged of her husband, with the extremest\nimportunity, to do as much for her; and God, at their joint request,\nshortly after calling her to Him, it was a death embraced with singular\nand mutual content.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII\n\nTHAT FORTUNE IS OFTENTIMES OBSERVED TO ACT BY THE RULE OF REASON\n\nThe inconstancy and various motions of Fortune\n\n     [The term Fortune, so often employed by Montaigne, and in passages\n     where he might have used Providence, was censured by the doctors who\n     examined his Essays when he was at Rome in 1581.  See his Travels,\n     i. 35 and 76.]\n\nmay reasonably make us expect she should present us with all sorts of\nfaces.  Can there be a more express act of justice than this?  The Duc de\nValentinois,--[Caesar Borgia.]--having resolved to poison Adrian,\nCardinal of Corneto, with whom Pope Alexander VI., his father and\nhimself, were to sup in the Vatican, he sent before a bottle of poisoned\nwine, and withal, strict order to the butler to keep it very safe.\nThe Pope being come before his son, and calling for drink, the butler\nsupposing this wine had not been so strictly recommended to his care,\nbut only upon the account of its excellency, presented it forthwith to\nthe Pope, and the duke himself coming in presently after, and being\nconfident they had not meddled with his bottle, took also his cup; so\nthat the father died immediately upon the spot--[Other historians assign\nthe Pope several days of misery prior to death.  D.W.]--, and the son,\nafter having been long tormented with sickness, was reserved to another\nand a worse fortune.\n\nSometimes she seems to play upon us, just in the nick of an affair;\nMonsieur d\u2019Estrees, at that time ensign to Monsieur de Vendome, and\nMonsieur de Licques, lieutenant in the company of the Duc d\u2019Ascot, being\nboth pretenders to the Sieur de Fougueselles\u2019 sister, though of several\nparties (as it oft falls out amongst frontier neighbours), the Sieur de\nLicques carried her; but on the same day he was married, and which was\nworse, before he went to bed to his wife, the bridegroom having a mind to\nbreak a lance in honour of his new bride, went out to skirmish near St.\nOmer, where the Sieur d\u2019Estrees proving the stronger, took him prisoner,\nand the more to illustrate his victory, the lady was fain--\n\n              \u201cConjugis ante coacta novi dimittere collum,\n               Quam veniens una atque altera rursus hyems\n               Noctibus in longis avidum saturasset amorem,\u201d\n\n     [\u201cCompelled to abstain from embracing her new spouse in her arms\n     before two winters pass in succession, during their long nights had\n     satiated her eager love.\u201d--Catullus, lxviii.  81.]\n\n--to request him of courtesy, to deliver up his prisoner to her, as he\naccordingly did, the gentlemen of France never denying anything to\nladies.\n\nDoes she not seem to be an artist here?  Constantine, son of Helena,\nfounded the empire of Constantinople, and so many ages after,\nConstantine, the son of Helen, put an end to it.  Sometimes she is\npleased to emulate our miracles we are told, that King Clovis besieging\nAngouleme, the walls fell down of themselves by divine favour and Bouchet\nhas it from some author, that King Robert having sat down before a city,\nand being stolen away from the siege to go keep the feast of St. Aignan\nat Orleans, as he was in devotion at a certain part of the Mass, the\nwalls of the beleaguered city, without any manner of violence, fell down\nwith a sudden ruin.  But she did quite contrary in our Milan wars; for,\nle Capitaine Rense laying siege for us to the city Arona, and having\ncarried a mine under a great part of the wall, the mine being sprung, the\nwall was lifted from its base, but dropped down again nevertheless, whole\nand entire, and so exactly upon its foundation, that the besieged\nsuffered no inconvenience by that attempt.\n\nSometimes she plays the physician.  Jason of Pheres being given over by\nthe physicians, by reason of an imposthume in his breast, having a mind\nto rid himself of his pain, by death at least, threw himself in a battle\ndesperately into the thickest of the enemy, where he was so fortunately\nwounded quite through the body, that the imposthume broke, and he was\nperfectly cured.  Did she not also excel the painter Protogenes in his\nart? who having finished the picture of a dog quite tired and out of\nbreath, in all the other parts excellently well to his own liking, but\nnot being able to express, as he would, the slaver and foam that should\ncome out of its mouth, vexed and angry at his work, he took his sponge,\nwhich by cleaning his pencils had imbibed several sorts of colours, and\nthrew it in a rage against the picture, with an intent utterly to deface\nit; when fortune guiding the sponge to hit just upon the mouth of the\ndog, it there performed what all his art was not able to do.  Does she\nnot sometimes direct our counsels and correct them?  Isabel, Queen of\nEngland, having to sail from Zealand into her own kingdom,--[in 1326]--\nwith an army, in favour of her son against her husband, had been lost,\nhad she come into the port she intended, being there laid wait for by the\nenemy; but fortune, against her will, threw her into another haven, where\nshe landed in safety.  And that man of old who, throwing a stone at a\ndog, hit and killed his mother-in-law, had he not reason to pronounce\nthis verse:\n\n          [\u201cFortune has more judgement than we.\u201d--Menander]\n\nIcetes had contracted with two soldiers to kill Timoleon at Adrana in\nSicily.--[Plutarch, Life of Timoleon, c. 7.]--They took their time to do\nit when he was assisting at a sacrifice, and thrusting into the crowd,\nas they were making signs to one another, that now was a fit time to do\ntheir business, in steps a third, who, with a sword takes one of them\nfull drive over the pate, lays him dead upon the place and runs away,\nwhich the others see, and concluding himself discovered and lost, runs to\nthe altar and begs for mercy, promising to discover the whole truth,\nwhich as he was doing, and laying open the full conspiracy, behold the\nthird man, who being apprehended, was, as a murderer, thrust and hauled\nby the people through the press, towards Timoleon, and the other most\neminent persons of the assembly, before whom being brought, he cries out\nfor pardon, pleading that he had justly slain his father\u2019s murderer;\nwhich he, also, proving upon the spot, by sufficient witnesses, whom his\ngood fortune very opportunely supplied him withal, that his father was\nreally killed in the city of Leontini, by that very man on whom he had\ntaken his revenge, he was presently awarded ten Attic minae, for having\nhad the good fortune, by designing to revenge the death of his father,\nto preserve the life of the common father of Sicily.  Fortune, truly, in\nher conduct surpasses all the rules of human prudence.\n\nBut to conclude: is there not a direct application of her favour, bounty,\nand piety manifestly discovered in this action?  Ignatius the father and\nIgnatius the son being proscribed by the triumvirs of Rome, resolved upon\nthis generous act of mutual kindness, to fall by the hands of one\nanother, and by that means to frustrate and defeat the cruelty of the\ntyrants; and accordingly with their swords drawn, ran full drive upon one\nanother, where fortune so guided the points, that they made two equally\nmortal wounds, affording withal so much honour to so brave a friendship,\nas to leave them just strength enough to draw out their bloody swords,\nthat they might have liberty to embrace one another in this dying\ncondition, with so close and hearty an embrace, that the executioner cut\noff both their heads at once, leaving the bodies still fast linked\ntogether in this noble bond, and their wounds joined mouth to mouth,\naffectionately sucking in the last blood and remainder of the lives of\neach other.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV\n\nOF ONE DEFECT IN OUR GOVERNMENT\n\nMy late father, a man that had no other advantages than experience and\nhis own natural parts, was nevertheless of a very clear judgment,\nformerly told me that he once had thoughts of endeavouring to introduce\nthis practice; that there might be in every city a certain place assigned\nto which such as stood in need of anything might repair, and have their\nbusiness entered by an officer appointed for that purpose.  As for\nexample: I want a chapman to buy my pearls; I want one that has pearls to\nsell; such a one wants company to go to Paris; such a one seeks a servant\nof such a quality; such a one a master; such a one such an artificer;\nsome inquiring for one thing, some for another, every one according to\nwhat he wants.  And doubtless, these mutual advertisements would be of no\ncontemptible advantage to the public correspondence and intelligence: for\nthere are evermore conditions that hunt after one another, and for want\nof knowing one another\u2019s occasions leave men in very great necessity.\n\nI have heard, to the great shame of the age we live in, that in our very\nsight two most excellent men for learning died so poor that they had\nscarce bread to put in their mouths: Lilius Gregorius Giraldus in Italy\nand Sebastianus Castalio in Germany: and I believe there are a thousand\nmen would have invited them into their families, with very advantageous\nconditions, or have relieved them where they were, had they known their\nwants.  The world is not so generally corrupted, but that I know a man\nthat would heartily wish the estate his ancestors have left him might be\nemployed, so long as it shall please fortune to give him leave to enjoy\nit, to secure rare and remarkable persons of any kind, whom misfortune\nsometimes persecutes to the last degree, from the dangers of necessity;\nand at least place them in such a condition that they must be very hard\nto please, if they are not contented.\n\nMy father in his domestic economy had this rule (which I know how to\ncommend, but by no means to imitate), namely, that besides the day-book\nor memorial of household affairs, where the small accounts, payments, and\ndisbursements, which do not require a secretary\u2019s hand, were entered, and\nwhich a steward always had in custody, he ordered him whom he employed to\nwrite for him, to keep a journal, and in it to set down all the\nremarkable occurrences, and daily memorials of the history of his house:\nvery pleasant to look over, when time begins to wear things out of\nmemory, and very useful sometimes to put us out of doubt when such a\nthing was begun, when ended; what visitors came, and when they went; our\ntravels, absences, marriages, and deaths; the reception of good or ill\nnews; the change of principal servants, and the like.  An ancient custom,\nwhich I think it would not be amiss for every one to revive in his own\nhouse; and I find I did very foolishly in neglecting it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXV\n\nOF THE CUSTOM OF WEARING CLOTHES\n\nWhatever I shall say upon this subject, I am of necessity to invade some\nof the bounds of custom, so careful has she been to shut up all the\navenues.  I was disputing with myself in this shivering season, whether\nthe fashion of going naked in those nations lately discovered is imposed\nupon them by the hot temperature of the air, as we say of the Indians and\nMoors, or whether it be the original fashion of mankind.  Men of\nunderstanding, forasmuch as all things under the sun, as the Holy Writ\ndeclares, are subject to the same laws, were wont in such considerations\nas these, where we are to distinguish the natural laws from those which\nhave been imposed by man\u2019s invention, to have recourse to the general\npolity of the world, where there can be nothing counterfeit.  Now, all\nother creatures being sufficiently furnished with all things necessary\nfor the support of their being--[Montaigne\u2019s expression is, \u201cwith needle\nand thread.\u201d--W.C.H.]--it is not to be imagined that we only are brought\ninto the world in a defective and indigent condition, and in such a state\nas cannot subsist without external aid.  Therefore it is that I believe,\nthat as plants, trees, and animals, and all things that have life, are\nseen to be by nature sufficiently clothed and covered, to defend them\nfrom the injuries of weather:\n\n         \u201cProptereaque fere res omnes ant corio sunt,\n          Aut seta, ant conchis, ant callo, ant cortice tectae,\u201d\n\n     [\u201cAnd that for this reason nearly all things are clothed with skin,\n     or hair, or shells, or bark, or some such thing.\u201d\n      --Lucretius, iv. 936.]\n\nso were we: but as those who by artificial light put out that of day, so\nwe by borrowed forms and fashions have destroyed our own.  And \u2018tis plain\nenough to be seen, that \u2018tis custom only which renders that impossible\nthat otherwise is nothing so; for of those nations who have no manner of\nknowledge of clothing, some are situated under the same temperature that\nwe are, and some in much colder climates.  And besides, our most tender\nparts are always exposed to the air, as the eyes, mouth, nose, and ears;\nand our country labourers, like our ancestors in former times, go with\ntheir breasts and bellies open.  Had we been born with a necessity upon\nus of wearing petticoats and breeches, there is no doubt but nature would\nhave fortified those parts she intended should be exposed to the fury of\nthe seasons with a thicker skin, as she has done the finger-ends and the\nsoles of the feet.  And why should this seem hard to believe?  I observe\nmuch greater distance betwixt my habit and that of one of our country\nboors, than betwixt his and that of a man who has no other covering but\nhis skin.  How many men, especially in Turkey, go naked upon the account\nof devotion?  Some one asked a beggar, whom he saw in his shirt in the\ndepth of winter, as brisk and frolic as he who goes muffled up to the\nears in furs, how he was able to endure to go so?  \u201cWhy, sir,\u201d he\nanswered, \u201cyou go with your face bare: I am all face.\u201d  The Italians have\na story of the Duke of Florence\u2019s fool, whom his master asking how, being\nso thinly clad, he was able to support the cold, when he himself, warmly\nwrapped up as he was, was hardly able to do it?  \u201cWhy,\u201d replied the fool,\n\u201cuse my receipt to put on all your clothes you have at once, and you\u2019ll\nfeel no more cold than I.\u201d  King Massinissa, to an extreme old age, could\nnever be prevailed upon to go with his head covered, how cold, stormy, or\nrainy soever the weather might be; which also is reported of the Emperor\nSeverus.  Herodotus tells us, that in the battles fought betwixt the\nEgyptians and the Persians, it was observed both by himself and by\nothers, that of those who were left dead upon the field, the heads of the\nEgyptians were without comparison harder than those of the Persians, by\nreason that the last had gone with their heads always covered from their\ninfancy, first with biggins, and then with turbans, and the others always\nshaved and bare.  King Agesilaus continued to a decrepit age to wear\nalways the same clothes in winter that he did in summer.  Caesar, says\nSuetonius, marched always at the head of his army, for the most part on\nfoot, with his head bare, whether it was rain or sunshine, and as much is\nsaid of Hannibal:\n\n                              \u201cTum vertice nudo,\n               Excipere insanos imbres, coelique ruinam.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cBareheaded he marched in snow, exposed to pouring rain and the\n     utmost rigour of the weather.\u201d--Silius Italicus, i. 250.]\n\nA Venetian who has long lived in Pegu, and has lately returned thence,\nwrites that the men and women of that kingdom, though they cover all\ntheir other parts, go always barefoot and ride so too; and Plato very\nearnestly advises for the health of the whole body, to give the head and\nthe feet no other clothing than what nature has bestowed.  He whom the\nPoles have elected for their king,--[Stephen Bathory]--since ours came\nthence, who is, indeed, one of the greatest princes of this age, never\nwears any gloves, and in winter or whatever weather can come, never wears\nother cap abroad than that he wears at home.  Whereas I cannot endure to\ngo unbuttoned or untied; my neighbouring labourers would think themselves\nin chains, if they were so braced.  Varro is of opinion, that when it was\nordained we should be bare in the presence of the gods and before the\nmagistrate, it was so ordered rather upon the score of health, and to\ninure us to the injuries of weather, than upon the account of reverence;\nand since we are now talking of cold, and Frenchmen used to wear variety\nof colours (not I myself, for I seldom wear other than black or white, in\nimitation of my father), let us add another story out of Le Capitaine\nMartin du Bellay, who affirms, that in the march to Luxembourg he saw so\ngreat frost, that the munition-wine was cut with hatchets and wedges, and\ndelivered out to the soldiers by weight, and that they carried it away in\nbaskets: and Ovid,\n\n              \u201cNudaque consistunt, formam servantia testae,\n               Vina; nec hausta meri, sed data frusta, bibunt.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThe wine when out of the cask retains the form of the cask;\n     and is given out not in cups, but in bits.\u201d\n      --Ovid, Trist., iii. 10, 23.]\n\nAt the mouth of Lake Maeotis the frosts are so very sharp, that in the\nvery same place where Mithridates\u2019 lieutenant had fought the enemy\ndryfoot and given them a notable defeat, the summer following he obtained\nover them a naval victory.  The Romans fought at a very great\ndisadvantage, in the engagement they had with the Carthaginians near\nPiacenza, by reason that they went to the charge with their blood\ncongealed and their limbs numbed with cold, whereas Hannibal had caused\ngreat fires to be dispersed quite through his camp to warm his soldiers,\nand oil to be distributed amongst them, to the end that anointing\nthemselves, they might render their nerves more supple and active, and\nfortify the pores against the violence of the air and freezing wind,\nwhich raged in that season.\n\nThe retreat the Greeks made from Babylon into their own country is famous\nfor the difficulties and calamities they had to overcome; of which this\nwas one, that being encountered in the mountains of Armenia with a\nhorrible storm of snow, they lost all knowledge of the country and of the\nways, and being driven up, were a day and a night without eating or\ndrinking; most of their cattle died, many of themselves were starved to\ndeath, several struck blind with the force of the hail and the glare of\nthe snow, many of them maimed in their fingers and toes, and many stiff\nand motionless with the extremity of the cold, who had yet their\nunderstanding entire.\n\nAlexander saw a nation, where they bury their fruit-trees in winter to\nprotect them from being destroyed by the frost, and we also may see the\nsame.\n\nBut, so far as clothes go, the King of Mexico changed four times a day\nhis apparel, and never put it on again, employing that he left off in his\ncontinual liberalities and rewards; and neither pot, dish, nor other\nutensil of his kitchen or table was ever served twice.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVI\n\nOF CATO THE YOUNGER\n\n     [\u201cI am not possessed with this common errour, to judge of others\n     according to what I am my selfe.  I am easie to beleeve things\n     differing from my selfe.  Though I be engaged to one forme, I do not\n     tie the world unto it, as every man doth.  And I beleeve and\n     conceive a thousand manners of life, contrary to the common sorte.\u201d\n      --Florio, ed. 1613, p. 113.]\n\nI am not guilty of the common error of judging another by myself.  I\neasily believe that in another\u2019s humour which is contrary to my own; and\nthough I find myself engaged to one certain form, I do not oblige others\nto it, as many do; but believe and apprehend a thousand ways of living;\nand, contrary to most men, more easily admit of difference than\nuniformity amongst us.  I as frankly as any one would have me, discharge\na man from my humours and principles, and consider him according to his\nown particular model.  Though I am not continent myself, I nevertheless\nsincerely approve the continence of the Feuillans and Capuchins, and\nhighly commend their way of living.  I insinuate myself by imagination\ninto their place, and love and honour them the more for being other than\nI am.  I very much desire that we may be judged every man by himself, and\nwould not be drawn into the consequence of common examples.  My own\nweakness nothing alters the esteem I ought to have for the force and\nvigour of those who deserve it:\n\n     \u201cSunt qui nihil suadent, quam quod se imitari posse confidunt.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThere are who persuade nothing but what they believe they can\n     imitate themselves.\u201d--Cicero, De Orator., c. 7.]\n\nCrawling upon the slime of the earth, I do not for all that cease to\nobserve up in the clouds the inimitable height of some heroic souls.\n\u2018Tis a great deal for me to have my judgment regular and just, if the\neffects cannot be so, and to maintain this sovereign part, at least, free\nfrom corruption; \u2018tis something to have my will right and good where my\nlegs fail me.  This age wherein we live, in our part of the world at\nleast, is grown so stupid, that not only the exercise, but the very\nimagination of virtue is defective, and seems to be no other but college\njargon:\n\n                        \u201cVirtutem verba putant, ut\n                 Lucum ligna:\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThey think words virtue, as they think mere wood a sacred grove.\u201d\n      --Horace, Ep., i. 6, 31.]\n\n          \u201cQuam vereri deberent, etiam si percipere non possent.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cWhich they ought to reverence, though they cannot comprehend.\u201d\n      --Cicero, Tusc. Quas., v. 2.]\n\n\u2018Tis a gewgaw to hang in a cabinet or at the end of the tongue, as on the\ntip of the ear, for ornament only.  There are no longer virtuous actions\nextant; those actions that carry a show of virtue have yet nothing of its\nessence; by reason that profit, glory, fear, custom, and other suchlike\nforeign causes, put us on the way to produce them.  Our justice also,\nvalour, courtesy, may be called so too, in respect to others and\naccording to the face they appear with to the public; but in the doer it\ncan by no means be virtue, because there is another end proposed, another\nmoving cause.  Now virtue owns nothing to be hers, but what is done by\nherself and for herself alone.\n\nIn that great battle of Plataea, that the Greeks under the command of\nPausanias gained against Mardonius and the Persians, the conquerors,\naccording to their custom, coming to divide amongst them the glory of the\nexploit, attributed to the Spartan nation the pre-eminence of valour in\nthe engagement.  The Spartans, great judges of virtue, when they came to\ndetermine to what particular man of their nation the honour was due of\nhaving the best behaved himself upon this occasion, found that\nAristodemus had of all others hazarded his person with the greatest\nbravery; but did not, however, allow him any prize, by reason that his\nvirtue had been incited by a desire to clear his reputation from the\nreproach of his miscarriage at the business of Thermopylae, and to die\nbravely to wipe off that former blemish.\n\nOur judgments are yet sick, and obey the humour of our depraved manners.\nI observe most of the wits of these times pretend to ingenuity, by\nendeavouring to blemish and darken the glory of the bravest and most\ngenerous actions of former ages, putting one vile interpretation or\nanother upon them, and forging and supposing vain causes and motives for\nthe noble things they did: a mighty subtlety indeed!  Give me the\ngreatest and most unblemished action that ever the day beheld, and I will\ncontrive a hundred plausible drifts and ends to obscure it.  God knows,\nwhoever will stretch them out to the full, what diversity of images our\ninternal wills suffer under.  They do not so maliciously play the\ncensurers, as they do it ignorantly and rudely in all their detractions.\n\nThe same pains and licence that others take to blemish and bespatter\nthese illustrious names, I would willingly undergo to lend them a\nshoulder to raise them higher.  These rare forms, that are culled out by\nthe consent of the wisest men of all ages, for the world\u2019s example,\nI should not stick to augment in honour, as far as my invention would\npermit, in all the circumstances of favourable interpretation; and we may\nwell believe that the force of our invention is infinitely short of their\nmerit.  \u2018Tis the duty of good men to portray virtue as beautiful as they\ncan, and there would be nothing wrong should our passion a little\ntransport us in favour of so sacred a form.  What these people do, on the\ncontrary, they either do out of malice, or by the vice of confining their\nbelief to their own capacity; or, which I am more inclined to think, for\nnot having their sight strong, clear, and elevated enough to conceive the\nsplendour of virtue in her native purity: as Plutarch complains, that in\nhis time some attributed the cause of the younger Cato\u2019s death to his\nfear of Caesar, at which he seems very angry, and with good reason; and\nby this a man may guess how much more he would have been offended with\nthose who have attributed it to ambition.  Senseless people!  He would\nrather have performed a noble, just, and generous action, and to have had\nignominy for his reward, than for glory.  That man was in truth a pattern\nthat nature chose out to show to what height human virtue and constancy\ncould arrive.\n\nBut I am not capable of handling so rich an argument, and shall therefore\nonly set five Latin poets together, contending in the praise of Cato;\nand, incidentally, for their own too.  Now, a well-educated child will\njudge the two first, in comparison of the others, a little flat and\nlanguid; the third more vigorous, but overthrown by the extravagance of\nhis own force; he will then think that there will be room for one or two\ngradations of invention to come to the fourth, and, mounting to the pitch\nof that, he will lift up his hands in admiration; coming to the last, the\nfirst by some space\u2019 (but a space that he will swear is not to be filled\nup by any human wit), he will be astounded, he will not know where he is.\n\nAnd here is a wonder: we have far more poets than judges and interpreters\nof poetry; it is easier to write it than to understand it.  There is,\nindeed, a certain low and moderate sort of poetry, that a man may well\nenough judge by certain rules of art; but the true, supreme, and divine\npoesy is above all rules and reason.  And whoever discerns the beauty of\nit with the most assured and most steady sight, sees no more than the\nquick reflection of a flash of lightning: it does not exercise, but\nravishes and overwhelms our judgment.  The fury that possesses him who is\nable to penetrate into it wounds yet a third man by hearing him repeat\nit; like a loadstone that not only attracts the needle, but also infuses\ninto it the virtue to attract others.  And it is more evidently manifest\nin our theatres, that the sacred inspiration of the Muses, having first\nstirred up the poet to anger, sorrow, hatred, and out of himself, to\nwhatever they will, does moreover by the poet possess the actor, and by\nthe actor consecutively all the spectators.  So much do our passions hang\nand depend upon one another.\n\nPoetry has ever had that power over me from a child to transpierce and\ntransport me; but this vivid sentiment that is natural to me has been\nvariously handled by variety of forms, not so much higher or lower (for\nthey were ever the highest of every kind), as differing in colour.\nFirst, a gay and sprightly fluency; afterwards, a lofty and penetrating\nsubtlety; and lastly, a mature and constant vigour.  Their names will\nbetter express them: Ovid, Lucan, Virgil.\n\nBut our poets are beginning their career:\n\n         \u201cSit Cato, dum vivit, sane vel Caesare major,\u201d\n\n     [\u201cLet Cato, whilst he live, be greater than Caesar.\u201d\n      --Martial, vi. 32]\n\nsays one.\n\n               \u201cEt invictum, devicta morte, Catonem,\u201d\n\n          [\u201cAnd Cato invincible, death being overcome.\u201d\n           --Manilius, Astron., iv. 87.]\n\nsays the second.  And the third, speaking of the civil wars betwixt\nCaesar and Pompey,\n\n          \u201cVictrix causa diis placuit, set victa Catoni.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThe victorious cause blessed the gods, the defeated one Cato.\n     --\u201cLucan, i. 128.]\n\nAnd the fourth, upon the praises of Caesar:\n\n              \u201cEt cuncta terrarum subacta,\n               Praeter atrocem animum Catonis.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cAnd conquered all but the indomitable mind of Cato.\u201d\n      --Horace, Od., ii. 1, 23.]\n\nAnd the master of the choir, after having set forth all the great names\nof the greatest Romans, ends thus:\n\n                    \u201cHis dantem jura Catonem.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cCato giving laws to all the rest.\u201d--AEneid, viii. 670.]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVII\n\nTHAT WE LAUGH AND CRY FOR THE SAME THING\n\nWhen we read in history that Antigonus was very much displeased with his\nson for presenting him the head of King Pyrrhus his enemy, but newly\nslain fighting against him, and that seeing it, he wept; and that Rene,\nDuke of Lorraine, also lamented the death of Charles, Duke of Burgundy,\nwhom he had himself defeated, and appeared in mourning at his funeral;\nand that in the battle of D\u2019Auray (which Count Montfort obtained over\nCharles de Blois, his competitor for the duchy of Brittany), the\nconqueror meeting the dead body of his enemy, was very much afflicted at\nhis death, we must not presently cry out:\n\n              \u201cE cosi avven, the l\u2019animo ciascuna\n               Sua passion sotto \u2018l contrario manto,\n               Ricopre, con la vista or\u2019chiara, or\u2019bruna.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cAnd thus it happens that the mind of each veils its passion under\n     a different appearance, and beneath a smiling visage, gay beneath a\n     sombre air.\u201d--Petrarch.]\n\nWhen Pompey\u2019s head was presented to Caesar, the histories tell us that he\nturned away his face, as from a sad and unpleasing object.  There had\nbeen so long an intelligence and society betwixt them in the management\nof the public affairs, so great a community of fortunes, so many mutual\noffices, and so near an alliance, that this countenance of his ought not\nto suffer under any misinterpretation, or to be suspected for either\nfalse or counterfeit, as this other seems to believe:\n\n                             \u201cTutumque putavit\n          Jam bonus esse socer; lacrymae non sponte cadentes,\n          Effudit, gemitusque expressit pectore laeto;\u201d\n\n     [\u201cAnd now he thought it safe to play the kind father-in-law,\n     shedding forced tears, and from a joyful breast discharging sighs\n     and groans.\u201d--Lucan, ix. 1037.]\n\nfor though it be true that the greatest part of our actions are no other\nthan visor and disguise, and that it may sometimes be true that\n\n               \u201cHaeredis fletus sub persona rises est,\u201d\n\n          [\u201cThe heir\u2019s tears behind the mask are smiles.\u201d\n           --Publius Syrus, apud Gellium, xvii. 14.]\n\nyet, in judging of these accidents, we are to consider how much our souls\nare oftentimes agitated with divers passions.  And as they say that in\nour bodies there is a congregation of divers humours, of which that is\nthe sovereign which, according to the complexion we are of, is commonly\nmost predominant in us: so, though the soul have in it divers motions to\ngive it agitation, yet must there of necessity be one to overrule all the\nrest, though not with so necessary and absolute a dominion but that\nthrough the flexibility and inconstancy of the soul, those of less\nauthority may upon occasion reassume their place and make a little sally\nin turn.  Thence it is, that we see not only children, who innocently\nobey and follow nature, often laugh and cry at the same thing, but not\none of us can boast, what journey soever he may have in hand that he has\nthe most set his heart upon, but when he comes to part with his family\nand friends, he will find something that troubles him within; and though\nhe refrain his tears yet he puts foot in the stirrup with a sad and\ncloudy countenance.  And what gentle flame soever may warm the heart of\nmodest and wellborn virgins, yet are they fain to be forced from about\ntheir mothers\u2019 necks to be put to bed to their husbands, whatever this\nboon companion is pleased to say:\n\n         \u201cEstne novis nuptis odio Venus?  anne parentum\n          Frustrantur falsis gaudia lachrymulis,\n          Ubertim thalami quasi intra limina fundunt?\n          Non, ita me divi, vera gemunt, juverint.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cIs Venus really so alarming to the new-made bride, or does she\n     honestly oppose her parent\u2019s rejoicing the tears she so abundantly\n     sheds on entering the nuptial chamber?  No, by the Gods, these are\n     no true tears.\u201d--Catullus, lxvi. 15.]\n\n     [\u201cIs Venus really so repugnant to newly-married maids?  Do they meet\n     the smiles of parents with feigned tears?  They weep copiously\n     within the very threshold of the nuptial chamber.  No, so the gods\n     help me, they do not truly grieve.\u201d--Catullus, lxvi.  15.]--\n     [A more literal translation.  D.W.]\n\nNeither is it strange to lament a person dead whom a man would by no\nmeans should be alive.  When I rattle my man, I do it with all the mettle\nI have, and load him with no feigned, but downright real curses; but the\nheat being over, if he should stand in need of me, I should be very ready\nto do him good: for I instantly turn the leaf.  When I call him calf and\ncoxcomb, I do not pretend to entail those titles upon him for ever;\nneither do I think I give myself the lie in calling him an honest fellow\npresently after.  No one quality engrosses us purely and universally.\nWere it not the sign of a fool to talk to one\u2019s self, there would hardly\nbe a day or hour wherein I might not be heard to grumble and mutter to\nmyself and against myself, \u201cConfound the fool!\u201d and yet I do not think\nthat to be my definition.  Who for seeing me one while cold and presently\nvery fond towards my wife, believes the one or the other to be\ncounterfeited, is an ass.  Nero, taking leave of his mother whom he was\nsending to be drowned, was nevertheless sensible of some emotion at this\nfarewell, and was struck with horror and pity.  \u2018Tis said, that the light\nof the sun is not one continuous thing, but that he darts new rays so\nthick one upon another that we cannot perceive the intermission:\n\n         \u201cLargus enim liquidi fons luminis, aetherius sol,\n          Irrigat assidue coelum candore recenti,\n          Suppeditatque novo confestim lumine lumen.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cSo the wide fountain of liquid light, the ethereal sun, steadily\n     fertilises the heavens with new heat, and supplies a continuous\n     store of fresh light.\u201d--Lucretius, v. 282.]\n\nJust so the soul variously and imperceptibly darts out her passions.\n\nArtabanus coming by surprise once upon his nephew Xerxes, chid him for\nthe sudden alteration of his countenance.  He was considering the\nimmeasurable greatness of his forces passing over the Hellespont for the\nGrecian expedition: he was first seized with a palpitation of joy, to see\nso many millions of men under his command, and this appeared in the\ngaiety of his looks: but his thoughts at the same instant suggesting to\nhim that of so many lives, within a century at most, there would not be\none left, he presently knit his brows and grew sad, even to tears.\n\nWe have resolutely pursued the revenge of an injury received, and been\nsensible of a singular contentment for the victory; but we shall weep\nnotwithstanding.  \u2018Tis not for the victory, though, that we shall weep:\nthere is nothing altered in that but the soul looks upon things with\nanother eye and represents them to itself with another kind of face; for\neverything has many faces and several aspects.\n\nRelations, old acquaintances, and friendships, possess our imaginations\nand make them tender for the time, according to their condition; but the\nturn is so quick, that \u2018tis gone in a moment:\n\n              \u201cNil adeo fieri celeri ratione videtur,\n               Quam si mens fieri proponit, et inchoat ipsa,\n               Ocius ergo animus, quam res se perciet ulla,\n               Ante oculos quorum in promptu natura videtur;\u201d\n\n     [\u201cNothing therefore seems to be done in so swift a manner than if\n     the mind proposes it to be done, and itself begins.  It is more\n     active than anything which we see in nature.\u201d--Lucretius, iii. 183.]\n\nand therefore, if we would make one continued thing of all this\nsuccession of passions, we deceive ourselves.  When Timoleon laments the\nmurder he had committed upon so mature and generous deliberation, he does\nnot lament the liberty restored to his country, he does not lament the\ntyrant; but he laments his brother: one part of his duty is performed;\nlet us give him leave to perform the other.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVIII\n\nOF SOLITUDE\n\nLet us pretermit that long comparison betwixt the active and the solitary\nlife; and as for the fine sayings with which ambition and avarice\npalliate their vices, that we are not born for ourselves but for the\npublic,--[This is the eulogium passed by Lucan on Cato of Utica, ii.\n383.]--let us boldly appeal to those who are in public affairs; let them\nlay their hands upon their hearts, and then say whether, on the contrary,\nthey do not rather aspire to titles and offices and that tumult of the\nworld to make their private advantage at the public expense.  The corrupt\nways by which in this our time they arrive at the height to which their\nambitions aspire, manifestly enough declares that their ends cannot be\nvery good.  Let us tell ambition that it is she herself who gives us a\ntaste of solitude; for what does she so much avoid as society?  What does\nshe so much seek as elbowroom?  A man many do well or ill everywhere; but\nif what Bias says be true, that the greatest part is the worse part, or\nwhat the Preacher says: there is not one good of a thousand:\n\n              \u201cRari quippe boni: numero vix sunt totidem quot\n               Thebarum portae, vel divitis ostia Nili,\u201d\n\n     [\u201cGood men forsooth are scarce: there are hardly as many as there\n     are gates of Thebes or mouths of the rich Nile.\u201d\n      --Juvenal, Sat., xiii. 26.]\n\nthe contagion is very dangerous in the crowd.  A man must either imitate\nthe vicious or hate them both are dangerous things, either to resemble\nthem because they are many or to hate many because they are unresembling\nto ourselves.  Merchants who go to sea are in the right when they are\ncautious that those who embark with them in the same bottom be neither\ndissolute blasphemers nor vicious other ways, looking upon such society\nas unfortunate.  And therefore it was that Bias pleasantly said to some,\nwho being with him in a dangerous storm implored the assistance of the\ngods: \u201cPeace, speak softly,\u201d said he, \u201cthat they may not know you are\nhere in my company.\u201d--[Diogenes Laertius]--And of more pressing\nexample, Albuquerque, viceroy in the Indies for Emmanuel, king of\nPortugal, in an extreme peril of shipwreck, took a young boy upon his\nshoulders, for this only end that, in the society of their common danger\nhis innocence might serve to protect him, and to recommend him to the\ndivine favour, that they might get safe to shore.  \u2018Tis not that a wise\nman may not live everywhere content, and be alone in the very crowd of a\npalace; but if it be left to his own choice, the schoolman will tell you\nthat he should fly the very sight of the crowd: he will endure it if need\nbe; but if it be referred to him, he will choose to be alone.  He cannot\nthink himself sufficiently rid of vice, if he must yet contend with it in\nother men.  Charondas punished those as evil men who were convicted of\nkeeping ill company.  There is nothing so unsociable and sociable as man,\nthe one by his vice, the other by his nature.  And Antisthenes, in my\nopinion, did not give him a satisfactory answer, who reproached him with\nfrequenting ill company, by saying that the physicians lived well enough\namongst the sick, for if they contribute to the health of the sick, no\ndoubt but by the contagion, continual sight of, and familiarity with\ndiseases, they must of necessity impair their own.\n\nNow the end, I take it, is all one, to live at more leisure and at one\u2019s\nease: but men do not always take the right way.  They often think they\nhave totally taken leave of all business, when they have only exchanged\none employment for another: there is little less trouble in governing a\nprivate family than a whole kingdom.  Wherever the mind is perplexed, it\nis in an entire disorder, and domestic employments are not less\ntroublesome for being less important.  Moreover, for having shaken off\nthe court and the exchange, we have not taken leave of the principal\nvexations of life:\n\n              \u201cRatio et prudentia curas,\n               Non locus effusi late maris arbiter, aufert;\u201d\n\n     [\u201cReason and prudence, not a place with a commanding view of the\n     great ocean, banish care.\u201d--Horace, Ep., i. 2.]\n\nambition, avarice, irresolution, fear, and inordinate desires, do not\nleave us because we forsake our native country:\n\n                                        \u201cEt\n                    Post equitem sedet atra cura;\u201d\n\n               [\u201cBlack care sits behind the horse man.\u201d\n                --Horace, Od., iii. 1, 40].\n\nthey often follow us even to cloisters and philosophical schools; nor\ndeserts, nor caves, hair-shirts, nor fasts, can disengage us from them:\n\n                    \u201cHaeret lateri lethalis arundo.\u201d\n\n          [\u201cThe fatal shaft adheres to the side.\u201d--AEneid, iv. 73.]\n\nOne telling Socrates that such a one was nothing improved by his travels:\n\u201cI very well believe it,\u201d said he, \u201cfor he took himself along with him\u201d\n\n                   \u201cQuid terras alio calentes\n                    Sole mutamus?  patriae quis exsul\n                    Se quoque fugit?\u201d\n\n     [\u201cWhy do we seek climates warmed by another sun?  Who is the man\n     that by fleeing from his country, can also flee from himself?\u201d\n      --Horace, Od., ii. 16, 18.]\n\nIf a man do not first discharge both himself and his mind of the burden\nwith which he finds himself oppressed, motion will but make it press the\nharder and sit the heavier, as the lading of a ship is of less\nencumbrance when fast and bestowed in a settled posture.  You do a sick\nman more harm than good in removing him from place to place; you fix and\nestablish the disease by motion, as stakes sink deeper and more firmly\ninto the earth by being moved up and down in the place where they are\ndesigned to stand.  Therefore, it is not enough to get remote from the\npublic; \u2018tis not enough to shift the soil only; a man must flee from the\npopular conditions that have taken possession of his soul, he must\nsequester and come again to himself:\n\n                         \u201cRupi jam vincula, dicas\n               Nam luctata canis nodum arripit; attamen illi,\n               Quum fugit, a collo trahitur pars longa catenae.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cYou say, perhaps, you have broken your chains: the dog who after\n     long efforts has broken his chain, still in his flight drags a heavy\n     portion of it after him.\u201d--Persius, Sat., v. 158.]\n\nWe still carry our fetters along with us.  \u2018Tis not an absolute liberty;\nwe yet cast back a look upon what we have left behind us; the fancy is\nstill full of it:\n\n          \u201cNisi purgatum est pectus, quae praelia nobis\n          Atque pericula tunc ingratis insinuandum?\n          Quantae connscindunt hominem cupedinis acres\n          Sollicitum curae? quantique perinde timores?\n          Quidve superbia, spurcitia, ac petulantia, quantas\n          Efficiunt clades? quid luxus desidiesque?\u201d\n\n     [\u201cBut unless the mind is purified, what internal combats and dangers\n     must we incur in spite of all our efforts!  How many bitter\n     anxieties, how many terrors, follow upon unregulated passion!\n     What destruction befalls us from pride, lust, petulant anger!\n     What evils arise from luxury and sloth!\u201d--Lucretius, v. 4.]\n\nOur disease lies in the mind, which cannot escape from itself;\n\n          \u201cIn culpa est animus, qui se non effugit unquam,\u201d\n           --Horace, Ep., i. 14, 13.\n\nand therefore is to be called home and confined within itself: that is\nthe true solitude, and that may be enjoyed even in populous cities and\nthe courts of kings, though more commodiously apart.\n\nNow, since we will attempt to live alone, and to waive all manner of\nconversation amongst them, let us so order it that our content may depend\nwholly upon ourselves; let us dissolve all obligations that ally us to\nothers; let us obtain this from ourselves, that we may live alone in good\nearnest, and live at our ease too.\n\nStilpo having escaped from the burning of his town, where he lost wife,\nchildren, and goods, Demetrius Poliorcetes seeing him, in so great a ruin\nof his country, appear with an undisturbed countenance, asked him if he\nhad received no loss?  To which he made answer, No; and that, thank God,\nnothing was lost of his.--[Seneca, Ep. 7.]--This also was the meaning of\nthe philosopher Antisthenes, when he pleasantly said, that \u201cmen should\nfurnish themselves with such things as would float, and might with the\nowner escape the storm\u201d;--[Diogenes Laertius, vi. 6.] and certainly a\nwise man never loses anything if he have himself.  When the city of Nola\nwas ruined by the barbarians, Paulinus, who was bishop of that place,\nhaving there lost all he had, himself a prisoner, prayed after this\nmanner: \u201cO Lord, defend me from being sensible of this loss; for Thou\nknowest they have yet touched nothing of that which is mine.\u201d--[St.\nAugustin, De Civit. Dei, i. 10.]--The riches that made him rich and the\ngoods that made him good, were still kept entire.  This it is to make\nchoice of treasures that can secure themselves from plunder and violence,\nand to hide them in such a place into which no one can enter and that is\nnot to be betrayed by any but ourselves.  Wives, children, and goods must\nbe had, and especially health, by him that can get it; but we are not so\nto set our hearts upon them that our happiness must have its dependence\nupon them; we must reserve a backshop, wholly our own and entirely free,\nwherein to settle our true liberty, our principal solitude and retreat.\nAnd in this we must for the most part entertain ourselves with ourselves,\nand so privately that no exotic knowledge or communication be admitted\nthere; there to laugh and to talk, as if without wife, children, goods,\ntrain, or attendance, to the end that when it shall so fall out that we\nmust lose any or all of these, it may be no new thing to be without them.\nWe have a mind pliable in itself, that will be company; that has\nwherewithal to attack and to defend, to receive and to give: let us not\nthen fear in this solitude to languish under an uncomfortable vacuity.\n\n                    \u201cIn solis sis tibi turba locis.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cIn solitude, be company for thyself.\u201d--Tibullus, vi. 13. 12.]\n\nVirtue is satisfied with herself, without discipline, without words,\nwithout effects.  In our ordinary actions there is not one of a thousand\nthat concerns ourselves.  He that thou seest scrambling up the ruins of\nthat wall, furious and transported, against whom so many harquebuss-shots\nare levelled; and that other all over scars, pale, and fainting with\nhunger, and yet resolved rather to die than to open the gates to him;\ndost thou think that these men are there upon their own account?  No;\nperadventure in the behalf of one whom they never saw and who never\nconcerns himself for their pains and danger, but lies wallowing the while\nin sloth and pleasure: this other slavering, blear-eyed, slovenly fellow,\nthat thou seest come out of his study after midnight, dost thou think he\nhas been tumbling over books to learn how to become a better man, wiser,\nand more content?  No such matter; he will there end his days, but he\nwill teach posterity the measure of Plautus\u2019 verses and the true\northography of a Latin word.  Who is it that does not voluntarily\nexchange his health, his repose, and his very life for reputation and\nglory, the most useless, frivolous, and false coin that passes current\namongst us?  Our own death does not sufficiently terrify and trouble us;\nlet us, moreover, charge ourselves with those of our wives, children, and\nfamily: our own affairs do not afford us anxiety enough; let us undertake\nthose of our neighbours and friends, still more to break our brains and\ntorment us:\n\n         \u201cVah! quemquamne hominem in animum instituere, aut\n          Parare, quod sit carius, quam ipse est sibi?\u201d\n\n     [\u201cAh! can any man conceive in his mind or realise what is dearer\n     than he is to himself?\u201d--Terence, Adelph., i. I, 13.]\n\nSolitude seems to me to wear the best favour in such as have already\nemployed their most active and flourishing age in the world\u2019s service,\nafter the example of Thales.  We have lived enough for others; let us at\nleast live out the small remnant of life for ourselves; let us now call\nin our thoughts and intentions to ourselves, and to our own ease and\nrepose.  \u2018Tis no light thing to make a sure retreat; it will be enough\nfor us to do without mixing other enterprises.  Since God gives us\nleisure to order our removal, let us make ready, truss our baggage, take\nleave betimes of the company, and disentangle ourselves from those\nviolent importunities that engage us elsewhere and separate us from\nourselves.\n\nWe must break the knot of our obligations, how strong soever, and\nhereafter love this or that, but espouse nothing but ourselves: that is\nto say, let the remainder be our own, but not so joined and so close as\nnot to be forced away without flaying us or tearing out part of our\nwhole.  The greatest thing in the world is for a man to know that he is\nhis own.  \u2018Tis time to wean ourselves from society when we can no longer\nadd anything to it; he who is not in a condition to lend must forbid\nhimself to borrow.  Our forces begin to fail us; let us call them in and\nconcentrate them in and for ourselves.  He that can cast off within\nhimself and resolve the offices of friendship and company, let him do it.\nIn this decay of nature which renders him useless, burdensome, and\nimportunate to others, let him take care not to be useless, burdensome,\nand importunate to himself.  Let him soothe and caress himself, and above\nall things be sure to govern himself with reverence to his reason and\nconscience to that degree as to be ashamed to make a false step in their\npresence:\n\n               \u201cRarum est enim, ut satis se quisque vereatur.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cFor \u2018tis rarely seen that men have respect and reverence enough\n     for themselves.\u201d--Quintilian, x. 7.]\n\nSocrates says that boys are to cause themselves to be instructed, men to\nexercise themselves in well-doing, and old men to retire from all civil\nand military employments, living at their own discretion, without the\nobligation to any office. There are some complexions more proper for\nthese precepts of retirement than others.  Such as are of a soft and dull\napprehension, and of a tender will and affection, not readily to be\nsubdued or employed, whereof I am one, both by natural condition and by\nreflection, will sooner incline to this advice than active and busy\nsouls, which embrace: all, engage in all, are hot upon everything, which\noffer, present, and give themselves up to every occasion.  We are to use\nthese accidental and extraneous commodities, so far as they are pleasant\nto us, but by no means to lay our principal foundation there; \u2018tis no\ntrue one; neither nature nor reason allows it so to be.  Why therefore\nshould we, contrary to their laws, enslave our own contentment to the\npower of another?  To anticipate also the accidents of fortune, to\ndeprive ourselves of the conveniences we have in our own power, as\nseveral have done upon the account of devotion, and some philosophers by\nreasoning; to be one\u2019s own servant, to lie hard, to put out our own eyes,\nto throw our wealth into the river, to go in search of grief; these, by\nthe misery of this life, aiming at bliss in another; those by laying\nthemselves low to avoid the danger of falling: all such are acts of an\nexcessive virtue.  The stoutest and most resolute natures render even\ntheir seclusion glorious and exemplary:\n\n                    \u201cTuta et parvula laudo,\n          Quum res deficiunt, satis inter vilia fortis\n          Verum, ubi quid melius contingit et unctius, idem\n          Hos sapere et solos aio bene vivere, quorum\n          Conspicitur nitidis fundata pecunia villis.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cWhen means are deficient, I laud a safe and humble condition,\n     content with little: but when things grow better and more easy, I\n     all the same say that you alone are wise and live well, whose\n     invested money is visible in beautiful villas.\u201d\n      --Horace, Ep., i. 15, 42.]\n\nA great deal less would serve my turn well enough.  \u2018Tis enough for me,\nunder fortune\u2019s favour, to prepare myself for her disgrace, and, being at\nmy ease, to represent to myself, as far as my imagination can stretch,\nthe ill to come; as we do at jousts and tiltings, where we counterfeit\nwar in the greatest calm of peace.  I do not think Arcesilaus the\nphilosopher the less temperate and virtuous for knowing that he made use\nof gold and silver vessels, when the condition of his fortune allowed him\nso to do; I have indeed a better opinion of him than if he had denied\nhimself what he used with liberality and moderation.  I see the utmost\nlimits of natural necessity: and considering a poor man begging at my\ndoor, ofttimes more jocund and more healthy than I myself am, I put\nmyself into his place, and attempt to dress my mind after his mode;\nand running, in like manner, over other examples, though I fancy death,\npoverty, contempt, and sickness treading on my heels, I easily resolve\nnot to be affrighted, forasmuch as a less than I takes them with so much\npatience; and am not willing to believe that a less understanding can do\nmore than a greater, or that the effects of precept cannot arrive to as\ngreat a height as those of custom.  And knowing of how uncertain duration\nthese accidental conveniences are, I never forget, in the height of all\nmy enjoyments, to make it my chiefest prayer to Almighty God, that He\nwill please to render me content with myself and the condition wherein I\nam.  I see young men very gay and frolic, who nevertheless keep a mass of\npills in their trunk at home, to take when they\u2019ve got a cold, which they\nfear so much the less, because they think they have remedy at hand.\nEvery one should do in like manner, and, moreover, if they find\nthemselves subject to some more violent disease, should furnish\nthemselves with such medicines as may numb and stupefy the part.\n\nThe employment a man should choose for such a life ought neither to be a\nlaborious nor an unpleasing one; otherwise \u2018tis to no purpose at all to\nbe retired.  And this depends upon every one\u2019s liking and humour.  Mine\nhas no manner of complacency for husbandry, and such as love it ought to\napply themselves to it with moderation:\n\n          [\u201cEndeavour to make circumstances subject to me,\n          and not me subject to circumstances.\u201d\n           --Horace, Ep., i. i, 19.]\n\nHusbandry is otherwise a very servile employment, as Sallust calls it;\nthough some parts of it are more excusable than the rest, as the care of\ngardens, which Xenophon attributes to Cyrus; and a mean may be found out\nbetwixt the sordid and low application, so full of perpetual solicitude,\nwhich is seen in men who make it their entire business and study, and the\nstupid and extreme negligence, letting all things go at random which we\nsee in others\n\n                    \u201cDemocriti pecus edit agellos\n          Cultaque, dum peregre est animus sine corpore velox.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cDemocritus\u2019 cattle eat his corn and spoil his fields, whilst his\n     soaring mind ranges abroad without the body.\u201d\n      --Horace, Ep., i, 12, 12.]\n\nBut let us hear what advice the younger Pliny gives his friend Caninius\nRufus upon the subject of solitude: \u201cI advise thee, in the full and\nplentiful retirement wherein thou art, to leave to thy hinds the care of\nthy husbandry, and to addict thyself to the study of letters, to extract\nfrom thence something that may be entirely and absolutely thine own.\u201d  By\nwhich he means reputation; like Cicero, who says that he would employ his\nsolitude and retirement from public affairs to acquire by his writings an\nimmortal life.\n\n                              \u201cUsque adeone\n          Scire tuum, nihil est, nisi to scire hoc, sciat alter?\u201d\n\n          [\u201cIs all that thy learning nothing, unless another knows\n          that thou knowest?\u201d--Persius, Sat., i. 23.]\n\nIt appears to be reason, when a man talks of retiring from the world,\nthat he should look quite out of [for] himself.  These do it but by\nhalves: they design well enough for themselves when they shall be no more\nin it; but still they pretend to extract the fruits of that design from\nthe world, when absent from it, by a ridiculous contradiction.\n\nThe imagination of those who seek solitude upon the account of devotion,\nfilling their hopes and courage with certainty of divine promises in the\nother life, is much more rationally founded.  They propose to themselves\nGod, an infinite object in goodness and power; the soul has there\nwherewithal, at full liberty, to satiate her desires: afflictions and\nsufferings turn to their advantage, being undergone for the acquisition\nof eternal health and joy; death is to be wished and longed for, where it\nis the passage to so perfect a condition; the asperity of the rules they\nimpose upon themselves is immediately softened by custom, and all their\ncarnal appetites baffled and subdued, by refusing to humour and feed\nthem, these being only supported by use and exercise.  This sole end of\nanother happily immortal life is that which really merits that we should\nabandon the pleasures and conveniences of this; and he who can really and\nconstantly inflame his soul with the ardour of this vivid faith and hope,\nerects for himself in solitude a more voluptuous and delicious life than\nany other sort of existence.\n\nNeither the end, then, nor the means of this advice pleases me, for we\noften fall out of the frying-pan into the fire.--[or: we always relapse\nill from fever into fever.]--This  book-employment is as painful as any\nother, and as great an enemy to health, which ought to be the first thing\nconsidered; neither ought a man to be allured with the pleasure of it,\nwhich is the same that destroys the frugal, the avaricious, the\nvoluptuous, and the ambitious man.\n\n     [\u201cThis plodding occupation of bookes is as painfull as any other,\n     and as great an enemie vnto health, which ought principally to be\n     considered.  And a man should not suffer him selfe to be inveagled\n     by the pleasure he takes in them.\u201d--Florio, edit. 1613, p. 122.]\n\nThe sages give us caution enough to beware the treachery of our desires,\nand to distinguish true and entire pleasures from such as are mixed and\ncomplicated with greater pain.  For the most of our pleasures, say they,\nwheedle and caress only to strangle us, like those thieves the Egyptians\ncalled Philistae; if the headache should come before drunkenness, we\nshould have a care of drinking too much; but pleasure, to deceive us,\nmarches before and conceals her train.  Books are pleasant, but if, by\nbeing over-studious, we impair our health and spoil our goodhumour, the\nbest pieces we have, let us give it over; I, for my part, am one of those\nwho think, that no fruit derived from them can recompense so great a\nloss.  As men who have long felt themselves weakened by indisposition,\ngive themselves up at last to the mercy of medicine and submit to certain\nrules of living, which they are for the future never to transgress; so he\nwho retires, weary of and disgusted with the common way of living, ought\nto model this new one he enters into by the rules of reason, and to\ninstitute and establish it by premeditation and reflection.  He ought to\nhave taken leave of all sorts of labour, what advantage soever it may\npromise, and generally to have shaken off all those passions which\ndisturb the tranquillity of body and soul, and then choose the way that\nbest suits with his own humour:\n\n               \u201cUnusquisque sua noverit ire via.\u201d\n\nIn husbandry, study, hunting, and all other exercises, men are to proceed\nto the utmost limits of pleasure, but must take heed of engaging further,\nwhere trouble begins to mix with it.  We are to reserve so much\nemployment only as is necessary to keep us in breath and to defend us\nfrom the inconveniences that the other extreme of a dull and stupid\nlaziness brings along with it.  There are sterile knotty sciences,\nchiefly hammered out for the crowd; let such be left to them who are\nengaged in the world\u2019s service.  I for my part care for no other books,\nbut either such as are pleasant and easy, to amuse me, or those that\ncomfort and instruct me how to regulate my life and death:\n\n               \u201cTacitum sylvas inter reptare salubres,\n               Curantem, quidquid dignum sapienti bonoque est.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cSilently meditating in the healthy groves, whatever is worthy\n     of a wise and good man.\u201d--Horace, Ep., i. 4, 4.]\n\nWiser men, having great force and vigour of soul, may propose to\nthemselves a rest wholly spiritual but for me, who have a very ordinary\nsoul, it is very necessary to support myself with bodily conveniences;\nand age having of late deprived me of those pleasures that were more\nacceptable to me, I instruct and whet my appetite to those that remain,\nmore suitable to this other reason.  We ought to hold with all our force,\nboth of hands and teeth, the use of the pleasures of life that our years,\none after another, snatch away from us:\n\n                         \u201cCarpamus dulcia; nostrum est,\n               Quod vivis; cinis, et manes, et fabula fies.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cLet us pluck life\u2019s sweets, \u2018tis for them we live: by and by we\n     shall be ashes, a ghost, a mere subject of talk.\u201d\n      --Persius, Sat., v. 151.]\n\nNow, as to the end that Pliny and Cicero propose to us of glory, \u2018tis\ninfinitely wide of my account.  Ambition is of all others the most\ncontrary humour to solitude; glory and repose are things that cannot\npossibly inhabit in one and the same place.  For so much as I understand,\nthese have only their arms and legs disengaged from the crowd; their soul\nand intention remain confined behind more than ever:\n\n          \u201cTun\u2019, vetule, auriculis alienis colligis escas?\u201d\n\n     [\u201cDost thou, then, old man, collect food for others\u2019 ears?\u201d\n      --Persius, Sat., i. 22.]\n\nthey have only retired to take a better leap, and by a stronger motion to\ngive a brisker charge into the crowd.  Will you see how they shoot short?\nLet us put into the counterpoise the advice of two philosophers, of two\nvery different sects, writing, the one to Idomeneus, the other to\nLucilius, their friends, to retire into solitude from worldly honours and\naffairs.  \u201cYou have,\u201d say they, \u201chitherto lived swimming and floating;\ncome now and die in the harbour: you have given the first part of your\nlife to the light, give what remains to the shade.  It is impossible to\ngive over business, if you do not also quit the fruit; therefore\ndisengage yourselves from all concern of name and glory; \u2018tis to be\nfeared the lustre of your former actions will give you but too much\nlight, and follow you into your most private retreat.  Quit with other\npleasures that which proceeds from the approbation of another man: and as\nto your knowledge and parts, never concern yourselves; they will not lose\ntheir effect if yourselves be the better for them.  Remember him, who\nbeing asked why he took so much pains in an art that could come to the\nknowledge of but few persons?  \u2018A few are enough for me,\u2019 replied he;\n\u2018I have enough with one; I have enough with never an one.\u2019--[Seneca, Ep.,\n7.]--He said true; you and a companion are theatre enough to one\nanother, or you to yourself.  Let the people be to you one, and be you\none to the whole people.  \u2018Tis an unworthy ambition to think to derive\nglory from a man\u2019s sloth and privacy: you are to do like the beasts of\nchase, who efface the track at the entrance into their den.  You are no\nmore to concern yourself how the world talks of you, but how you are to\ntalk to yourself.  Retire yourself into yourself, but first prepare\nyourself there to receive yourself: it were a folly to trust yourself in\nyour own hands, if you cannot govern yourself.  A man may miscarry alone\nas well as in company.  Till you have rendered yourself one before whom\nyou dare not trip, and till you have a bashfulness and respect for\nyourself,\n\n               \u201cObversentur species honestae animo;\u201d\n\n          [\u201cLet honest things be ever present to the mind\u201d\n           --Cicero, Tusc. Quaes., ii. 22.]\n\npresent continually to your imagination Cato, Phocion, and Aristides, in\nwhose presence the fools themselves will hide their faults, and make them\ncontrollers of all your intentions; should these deviate from virtue,\nyour respect to those will set you right; they will keep you in this way\nto be contented with yourself; to borrow nothing of any other but\nyourself; to stay and fix your soul in certain and limited thoughts,\nwherein she may please herself, and having understood the true and real\ngoods, which men the more enjoy the more they understand, to rest\nsatisfied, without desire of prolongation of life or name.\u201d  This is the\nprecept of the true and natural philosophy, not of a boasting and prating\nphilosophy, such as that of the two

Of the uncertainty of our judgment.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIX\n\nA CONSIDERATION UPON CICERO\n\nOne word more by way of comparison betwixt these two.  There are to be\ngathered out of the writings of Cicero and the younger Pliny (but little,\nin my opinion, resembling his uncle in his humours) infinite testimonies\nof a beyond measure ambitious nature; and amongst others, this for one,\nthat they both, in the sight of all the world, solicit the historians of\ntheir time not to forget them in their memoirs; and fortune, as if in\nspite, has made the vanity of those requests live upon record down to\nthis age of ours, while she has long since consigned the histories\nthemselves to oblivion.  But this exceeds all meanness of spirit in\npersons of such a quality as they were, to think to derive any great\nrenown from babbling and prating; even to the publishing of their private\nletters to their friends, and so withal, that though some of them were\nnever sent, the opportunity being lost, they nevertheless presented them\nto the light, with this worthy excuse that they were unwilling to lose\ntheir labours and lucubrations.  Was it not very well becoming two\nconsuls of Rome, sovereign magistrates of the republic that commanded\nthe world, to spend their leisure in contriving quaint and elegant\nmissives, thence to gain the reputation of being versed in their own\nmother-tongues?  What could a pitiful schoolmaster have done worse, whose\ntrade it was thereby to get his living?  If the acts of Xenophon and\nCaesar had not far transcended their eloquence, I scarce believe they\nwould ever have taken the pains to have written them; they made it their\nbusiness to recommend not their speaking, but their doing.  And could the\nperfection of eloquence have added a lustre suitable to a great\npersonage, certainly Scipio and Laelius had never resigned the honour of\ntheir comedies, with all the luxuriances and elegances of the Latin\ntongue, to an African slave; for that the work was theirs, its beauty and\nexcellence sufficiently declare; Terence himself confesses as much, and I\nshould take it ill from any one that would dispossess me of that belief.\n\n\u2018Tis a kind of mockery and offence to extol a man for qualities\nmisbecoming his condition, though otherwise commendable in themselves,\nbut such as ought not, however, to be his chief talent; as if a man\nshould commend a king for being a good painter, a good architect, a good\nmarksman, or a good runner at the ring: commendations that add no honour,\nunless mentioned altogether and in the train of those that are properly\napplicable to him, namely, justice and the science of governing and\nconducting his people both in peace and war.  At this rate, agriculture\nwas an honour to Cyrus, and eloquence and the knowledge of letters to\nCharlemagne.  I have in my time known some, who by writing acquired both\ntheir titles and fortune, disown their apprenticeship, corrupt their\nstyle, and affect ignorance in so vulgar a quality (which also our nation\nholds to be rarely seen in very learned hands), and to seek a reputation\nby better qualities.  Demosthenes\u2019 companions in the embassy to Philip,\nextolling that prince as handsome, eloquent, and a stout drinker,\nDemosthenes said that those were commendations more proper for a woman,\nan advocate, or a sponge, than for a king\u2019:\n\n                    \u201cImperet bellante prior, jacentem\n                    Lenis in hostem.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cIn the fight, overthrow your enemy, but be merciful to him when\n     fallen.--\u201cHorace, Carm. Saec., v. 51.]\n\n\u2018Tis not his profession to know either how to hunt or to dance well;\n\n               \u201cOrabunt causas alii, coelique meatus\n               Describent radio, et fulgentia sidera dicent;\n               Hic regere imperio populos sciat.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cLet others plead at the bar, or describe the spheres, and point\n     out the glittering stars; let this man learn to rule the nations.\u201d\n      --AEneid, vi. 849.]\n\nPlutarch says, moreover, that to appear so excellent in these less\nnecessary qualities is to produce witness against a man\u2019s self, that he\nhas spent his time and applied his study ill, which ought to have been\nemployed in the acquisition of more necessary and more useful things.\nSo that Philip, king of Macedon, having heard that great Alexander his\nson sing once at a feast to the wonder of the best musicians there: \u201cArt\nthou not ashamed,\u201d said he to him, \u201cto sing so well?\u201d And to the same\nPhilip a musician, with whom he was disputing about some things\nconcerning his art: \u201cHeaven forbid, sir,\u201d said he, \u201cthat so great a\nmisfortune should ever befall you as to understand these things better\nthan I.\u201d  A king should be able to answer as Iphicrates did the orator,\nwho pressed upon him in his invective after this manner: \u201cAnd what art\nthou that thou bravest it at this rate?  art thou a man at arms, art thou\nan archer, art thou a pikeman?\u201d--\u201cI am none of all this; but I know how\nto command all these.\u201d  And Antisthenes took it for an argument of little\nvalue in Ismenias that he was commended for playing excellently well upon\na flute.\n\nI know very well, that when I hear any one dwell upon the language of my\nessays, I had rather a great deal he would say nothing: \u2018tis not so much\nto elevate the style as to depress the sense, and so much the more\noffensively as they do it obliquely; and yet I am much deceived if many\nother writers deliver more worth noting as to the matter, and, how well\nor ill soever, if any other writer has sown things much more materials or\nat all events more downright, upon his paper than myself.  To bring the\nmore in, I only muster up the heads; should I annex the sequel, I should\ntrebly multiply the volume.  And how many stories have I scattered up and\ndown in this book that I only touch upon, which, should any one more\ncuriously search into, they would find matter enough to produce infinite\nessays.  Neither those stories nor my quotations always serve simply for\nexample, authority, or ornament; I do not only regard them for the use I\nmake of them: they carry sometimes besides what I apply them to, the seed\nof a more rich and a bolder matter, and sometimes, collaterally, a more\ndelicate sound both to myself who will say no more about it in this\nplace, and to others who shall be of my humour.\n\nBut returning to the speaking virtue: I find no great choice betwixt not\nknowing to speak anything but ill, and not knowing to speak anything but\nwell.\n\n               \u201cNon est ornamentum virile concimitas.\u201d\n\n          [\u201cA carefully arranged dress is no manly ornament.\u201d\n           --Seneca, Ep., 115.]\n\nThe sages tell us that, as to what concerns knowledge, \u2018tis nothing but\nphilosophy; and as to what concerns effects, nothing but virtue, which is\ngenerally proper to all degrees and to all orders.\n\nThere is something like this in these two other philosophers, for they\nalso promise eternity to the letters they write to their friends; but\n\u2018tis after another manner, and by accommodating themselves, for a good\nend, to the vanity of another; for they write to them that if the concern\nof making themselves known to future ages, and the thirst of glory, do\nyet detain them in the management of public affairs, and make them fear\nthe solitude and retirement to which they would persuade them, let them\nnever trouble themselves more about it, forasmuch as they shall have\ncredit enough with posterity to ensure them that were there nothing else\nbut the letters thus written to them, those letters will render their\nnames as known and famous as their own public actions could do.  And\nbesides this difference, these are not idle and empty letters, that\ncontain nothing but a fine jingle of well-chosen words and delicate\ncouched phrases, but rather replete and abounding with grand discourses\nof reason, by which a man may render himself not more eloquent, but more\nwise, and that instruct us not to speak, but to do well.  Away with that\neloquence that enchants us with itself, and not with actual things!\nunless you will allow that of Cicero to be of so supreme a perfection as\nto form a complete body of itself.\n\nI shall farther add one story we read of him to this purpose, wherein his\nnature will much more manifestly be laid open to us.  He was to make an\noration in public, and found himself a little straitened for time to make\nhimself ready at his ease; when Eros, one of his slaves, brought him word\nthat the audience was deferred till the next day, at which he was so\nravished with joy that he enfranchised him for the good news.\n\nUpon this subject of letters, I will add this more to what has been\nalready said, that it is a kind of writing wherein my friends think I can\ndo something; and I am willing to confess I should rather have chosen to\npublish my whimsies that way than any other, had I had to whom to write;\nbut I wanted such a settled intercourse, as I once had, to attract me to\nit, to raise my fancy, and to support me.  For to traffic with the wind,\nas some others have done, and to forge vain names to direct my letters\nto, in a serious subject, I could never do it but in a dream, being a\nsworn enemy to all manner of falsification.  I should have been more\ndiligent and more confident had I had a judicious and indulgent friend\nwhom to address, than thus to expose myself to the various judgments of a\nwhole people, and I am deceived if I had not succeeded better.  I have\nnaturally a humorous and familiar style; but it is a style of my own, not\nproper for public business, but, like the language I speak, too compact,\nirregular, abrupt, and singular; and as to letters of ceremony that have\nno other substance than a fine contexture of courteous words, I am wholly\nto seek.  I have neither faculty nor relish for those tedious tenders of\nservice and affection; I believe little in them from others, and I should\nnot forgive myself should I say to others more than I myself believe.\n\u2018Tis, doubtless, very remote from the present practice; for there never\nwas so abject and servile prostitution of offers: life, soul, devotion,\nadoration, vassal, slave, and I cannot tell what, as now; all which\nexpressions are so commonly and so indifferently posted to and fro by\nevery one and to every one, that when they would profess a greater and\nmore respectful inclination upon more just occasions, they have not\nwherewithal to express it.  I mortally hate all air of flattery, which is\nthe cause that I naturally fall into a shy, rough, and crude way of\nspeaking, that, to such as do not know me, may seem a little to relish of\ndisdain.  I honour those most to whom I show the least honour, and where\nmy soul moves with the greatest cheerfulness, I easily forget the\nceremonies of look and gesture, and offer myself faintly and bluntly to\nthem to whom I am the most devoted: methinks they should read it in my\nheart, and that the expression of my words does but injure the love I\nhave conceived within.  To welcome, take leave, give thanks, accost,\noffer my service, and such verbal formalities as the ceremonious laws of\nour modern civility enjoin, I know no man so stupidly unprovided of\nlanguage as myself; and I have never been employed in writing letters of\nfavour and recommendation, that he, in whose behalf it was written, did\nnot think my mediation cold and imperfect.  The Italians are great\nprinters of letters; I do believe I have at least an hundred several\nvolumes of them; of all which those of Annibale Caro seem to me to be the\nbest.  If all the paper I have scribbled to the ladies at the time when\nmy hand was really prompted by my passion, were now in being, there\nmight, peradventure, be found a page worthy to be communicated to our\nyoung inamoratos, that are besotted with that fury.  I always write my\nletters post-haste--so precipitately, that though I write intolerably\nill, I rather choose to do it myself, than to employ another; for I can\nfind none able to follow me: and I never transcribe any.  I have\naccustomed the great ones who know me to endure my blots and dashes, and\nupon paper without fold or margin.  Those that cost me the most pains,\nare the worst; when I once begin to draw it in by head and shoulders,\n\u2018tis a sign that I am not there.  I fall too without premeditation or\ndesign; the first word begets the second, and so to the end of the\nchapter.  The letters of this age consist more in fine edges and prefaces\nthan in matter.  Just as I had rather write two letters than close and\nfold up one, and always assign that employment to some other, so, when\nthe real business of my letter is dispatched, I would with all my heart\ntransfer it to another hand to add those long harangues, offers, and\nprayers, that we place at the bottom, and should be glad that some new\ncustom would discharge us of that trouble; as also of superscribing them\nwith a long legend of qualities and titles, which for fear of mistakes,\nI have often not written at all, and especially to men of the long robe\nand finance; there are so many new offices, such a dispensation and\nordering of titles of honour, that \u2018tis hard to set them forth aright\nyet, being so dearly bought, they are neither to be altered nor forgotten\nwithout offence.  I find it equally in bad taste to encumber the fronts\nand inscriptions of the books we commit to the press with such.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XL\n\nTHAT THE RELISH FOR GOOD AND EVIL DEPENDS IN GREAT MEASURE UPON THE\nOPINION WE HAVE OF THEM\n\nMen (says an ancient Greek sentence)--[Manual of Epictetus, c. 10.]--\nare tormented with the opinions they have of things and not by the things\nthemselves.  It were a great victory obtained for the relief of our\nmiserable human condition, could this proposition be established for\ncertain and true throughout.  For if evils have no admission into us but\nby the judgment we ourselves make of them, it should seem that it is,\nthen, in our own power to despise them or to turn them to good.  If\nthings surrender themselves to our mercy, why do we not convert and\naccommodate them to our advantage?  If what we call evil and torment is\nneither evil nor torment of itself, but only that our fancy gives it that\nquality, it is in us to change it, and it being in our own choice, if\nthere be no constraint upon us, we must certainly be very strange fools\nto take arms for that side which is most offensive to us, and to give\nsickness, want, and contempt a bitter and nauseous taste, if it be in our\npower to give them a pleasant relish, and if, fortune simply providing\nthe matter, \u2018tis for us to give it the form.  Now, that what we call evil\nis not so of itself, or at least to that degree that we make it, and that\nit depends upon us to give it another taste and complexion (for all comes\nto one), let us examine how that can be maintained.\n\nIf the original being of those things we fear had power to lodge itself\nin us by its own authority, it would then lodge itself alike, and in like\nmanner, in all; for men are all of the same kind, and saving in greater\nand less proportions, are all provided with the same utensils and\ninstruments to conceive and to judge; but the diversity of opinions we\nhave of those things clearly evidences that they only enter us by\ncomposition; one person, peradventure, admits them in their true being,\nbut a thousand others give them a new and contrary being in them.  We\nhold death, poverty, and pain for our principal enemies; now, this death,\nwhich some repute the most dreadful of all dreadful things, who does not\nknow that others call it the only secure harbour from the storms and\ntempests of life, the sovereign good of nature, the sole support of\nliberty, and the common and prompt remedy of all evils?  And as the one\nexpect it with fear and trembling, the others support it with greater\nease than life.  That one complains of its facility:\n\n          \u201cMors! utinam pavidos vitae subducere nolles.\n          Sed virtus to sola daret!\u201d\n\n     [\u201cO death! wouldst that thou might spare the coward, but that\n     valour alone should pay thee tribute.\u201d--Lucan, iv. 580.]\n\nNow, let us leave these boastful courages.  Theodorus answered\nLysimachus, who threatened to kill him, \u201cThou wilt do a brave feat,\u201d said\nhe, \u201cto attain the force of a cantharides.\u201d  The majority of philosophers\nare observed to have either purposely anticipated, or hastened and\nassisted their own death.  How many ordinary people do we see led to\nexecution, and that not to a simple death, but mixed with shame and\nsometimes with grievous torments, appear with such assurance, whether\nthrough firm courage or natural simplicity, that a man can discover no\nchange from their ordinary condition; settling their domestic affairs,\ncommending themselves to their friends, singing, preaching, and\naddressing the people, nay, sometimes sallying into jests, and drinking\nto their companions, quite as well as Socrates?\n\nOne that they were leading to the gallows told them they must not take\nhim through such a street, lest a merchant who lived there should arrest\nhim by the way for an old debt.  Another told the hangman he must not\ntouch his neck for fear of making him laugh, he was so ticklish.  Another\nanswered his confessor, who promised him he should that day sup with our\nLord, \u201cDo you go then,\u201d said he, \u201cin my room [place]; for I for my part\nkeep fast to-day.\u201d  Another having called for drink, and the hangman\nhaving drunk first, said he would not drink after him, for fear of\ncatching some evil disease.  Everybody has heard the tale of the Picard,\nto whom, being upon the ladder, they presented a common wench, telling\nhim (as our law does some times permit) that if he would marry her they\nwould save his life; he, having a while considered her and perceiving\nthat she halted: \u201cCome, tie up, tie up,\u201d said he, \u201cshe limps.\u201d  And they\ntell another story of the same kind of a fellow in Denmark, who being\ncondemned to lose his head, and the like condition being proposed to him\nupon the scaffold, refused it, by reason the girl they offered him had\nhollow cheeks and too sharp a nose.  A servant at Toulouse being accused\nof heresy, for the sum of his belief referred himself to that of his\nmaster, a young student, prisoner with him, choosing rather to die than\nsuffer himself to be persuaded that his master could err.  We read that\nof the inhabitants of Arras, when Louis XI. took that city, a great many\nlet themselves be hanged rather than they would say, \u201cGod save the King.\u201d\n And amongst that mean-souled race of men, the buffoons, there have been\nsome who would not leave their fooling at the very moment of death.  One\nthat the hang man was turning off the ladder cried:  \u201cLaunch the galley,\u201d\n an ordinary saying of his.  Another, whom at the point of death his\nfriends had laid upon a bed of straw before the fire, the physician\nasking him where his pain lay: \u201cBetwixt the bench and the fire,\u201d said he,\nand the priest, to give him extreme unction, groping for his feet which\nhis pain had made him pull up to him: \u201cYou will find them,\u201d said he, \u201cat\nthe end of my legs.\u201d  To one who being present exhorted him to recommend\nhimself to God: \u201cWhy, who goes thither?\u201d  said he; and the other\nreplying: \u201cIt will presently be yourself, if it be His good pleasure.\u201d\n \u201cShall I be sure to be there by to-morrow night?\u201d said he.  \u201cDo, but\nrecommend yourself to Him,\u201d said the other, \u201cand you will soon be there.\u201d\n \u201cI were best then,\u201d said he, \u201cto carry my recommendations myself.\u201d\n\nIn the kingdom of Narsingah to this day the wives of their priests are\nburied alive with the bodies of their husbands; all other wives are burnt\nat their husbands\u2019 funerals, which they not only firmly but cheerfully\nundergo.  At the death of their king, his wives and concubines, his\nfavourites, all his officers, and domestic servants, who make up a whole\npeople, present themselves so gaily to the fire where his body is burnt,\nthat they seem to take it for a singular honour to accompany their master\nin death.  During our late wars of Milan, where there happened so many\ntakings and retakings of towns, the people, impatient of so many changes\nof fortune, took such a resolution to die, that I have heard my father\nsay he there saw a list taken of five-and-twenty masters of families who\nmade themselves away in one week\u2019s time: an incident somewhat resembling\nthat of the Xanthians, who being besieged by Brutus, fell--men, women,\nand children--into such a furious appetite of dying, that nothing can be\ndone to evade death which they did not to avoid life; insomuch that\nBrutus had much difficulty in saving a very small number.--[\u201cOnly fifty\nwere saved.\u201d--Plutarch, Life of Brutus, c. 8.]\n\nEvery opinion is of force enough to cause itself to be espoused at the\nexpense of life.  The first article of that valiant oath that Greece took\nand observed in the Median war, was that every one should sooner exchange\nlife for death, than their own laws for those of Persia.  What a world of\npeople do we see in the wars betwixt the Turks and the Greeks, rather\nembrace a cruel death than uncircumcise themselves to admit of baptism?\nAn example of which no sort of religion is incapable.\n\nThe kings of Castile having banished the Jews out of their dominions,\nJohn, King of Portugal, in consideration of eight crowns a head, sold\nthem a retreat into his for a certain limited time, upon condition that\nthe time fixed coming to expire they should begone, and he to furnish\nthem with shipping to transport them into Africa.  The day comes, which\nonce lapsed they were given to understand that such as were afterward\nfound in the kingdom should remain slaves; vessels were very slenderly\nprovided; and those who embarked in them were rudely and villainously\nused by the passengers, who, besides other indignities, kept them\ncruising upon the sea, one while forwards and another backwards, till\nthey had spent all their provisions, and were constrained to buy of them\nat so dear a rate and so long withal, that they set them not on shore\ntill they were all stripped to the very shirts.  The news of this inhuman\nusage being brought to those who remained behind, the greater part of\nthem resolved upon slavery and some made a show of changing religion.\nEmmanuel, the successor of John, being come to the crown, first set them\nat liberty, and afterwards altering his mind, ordered them to depart his\ncountry, assigning three ports for their passage.  He hoped, says Bishop\nOsorius, no contemptible Latin historian of these later times, that the\nfavour of the liberty he had given them having failed of converting them\nto Christianity, yet the difficulty of committing themselves to the mercy\nof the mariners and of abandoning a country they were now habituated to\nand were grown very rich in, to go and expose themselves in strange and\nunknown regions, would certainly do it.  But finding himself deceived in\nhis expectation, and that they were all resolved upon the voyage, he cut\noff two of the three ports he had promised them, to the end that the\nlength and incommodity of the passage might reduce some, or that he might\nhave opportunity, by crowding them all into one place, the more\nconveniently to execute what he had designed, which was to force all the\nchildren under fourteen years of age from the arms of their fathers and\nmothers, to transport them from their sight and conversation, into a\nplace where they might be instructed and brought up in our religion.  He\nsays that this produced a most horrid spectacle the natural affection\nbetwixt the parents and their children, and moreover their zeal to their\nancient belief, contending against this violent decree, fathers and\nmothers were commonly seen making themselves away, and by a yet much more\nrigorous example, precipitating out of love and compassion their young\nchildren into wells and pits, to avoid the severity of this law.  As to\nthe remainder of them, the time that had been prefixed being expired,\nfor want of means to transport them they again returned into slavery.\nSome also turned Christians, upon whose faith, as also that of their\nposterity, even to this day, which is a hundred years since, few\nPortuguese can yet rely; though custom and length of time are much more\npowerful counsellors in such changes than all other constraints whatever.\nIn the town of Castelnaudari, fifty heretic Albigeois at one time\nsuffered themselves to be burned alive in one fire rather than they would\nrenounce their opinions.\n\n     \u201cQuoties non modo ductores nostri, sed universi etiam exercitus,\n     ad non dubiam mortem concurrerunt?\u201d\n\n     [\u201cHow often have not only our leaders, but whole armies, run to a\n     certain and manifest death.\u201d--Cicero, Tusc. Quaes., i. 37.]\n\nI have seen an intimate friend of mine run headlong upon death with a\nreal affection, and that was rooted in his heart by divers plausible\narguments which he would never permit me to dispossess him of, and upon\nthe first honourable occasion that offered itself to him, precipitate\nhimself into it, without any manner of visible reason, with an obstinate\nand ardent desire of dying.  We have several examples in our own times of\npersons, even young children, who for fear of some little inconvenience\nhave despatched themselves.  And what shall we not fear, says one of the\nancients--[Seneca, Ep., 70.]--to this purpose, if we dread that which\ncowardice itself has chosen for its refuge?\n\nShould I here produce a long catalogue of those, of all sexes and\nconditions and sects, even in the most happy ages, who have either with\ngreat constancy looked death in the face, or voluntarily sought it, and\nsought it not only to avoid the evils of this life, but some purely to\navoid the satiety of living, and others for the hope of a better\ncondition elsewhere, I should never have done.  Nay, the number is so\ninfinite that in truth I should have a better bargain on\u2019t to reckon up\nthose who have feared it.  This one therefore shall serve for all:\nPyrrho the philosopher being one day in a boat in a very great tempest,\nshewed to those he saw the most affrighted about him, and encouraged\nthem, by the example of a hog that was there, nothing at all concerned at\nthe storm.  Shall we then dare to say that this advantage of reason, of\nwhich we so much boast, and upon the account of which we think ourselves\nmasters and emperors over the rest of all creation, was given us for a\ntorment?  To what end serves the knowledge of things if it renders us\nmore unmanly? if we thereby lose the tranquillity and repose we should\nenjoy without it? and if it put us into a worse condition than Pyrrho\u2019s\nhog?  Shall we employ the understanding that was conferred upon us for\nour greatest good to our own ruin; setting ourselves against the design\nof nature and the universal order of things, which intend that every one\nshould make use of the faculties, members, and means he has to his own\nbest advantage?\n\nBut it may, peradventure, be objected against me: Your rule is true\nenough as to what concerns death; but what will you say of indigence?\nWhat will you, moreover, say of pain, which Aristippus, Hieronimus, and\nmost of the sages have reputed the worst of evils; and those who have\ndenied it by word of mouth have, however, confessed it in effect?\nPosidonius being extremely tormented with a sharp and painful disease,\nPompeius came to visit him, excusing himself that he had taken so\nunseasonable a time to come to hear him discourse of philosophy.\n\u201cThe gods forbid,\u201d said Posidonius to him, \u201cthat pain should ever have\nthe power to hinder me from talking,\u201d and thereupon fell immediately upon\na discourse of the contempt of pain: but, in the meantime, his own\ninfirmity was playing his part, and plagued him to purpose; to which he\ncried out, \u201cThou mayest work thy will, pain, and torment me with all the\npower thou hast, but thou shalt never make me say that thou art an evil.\u201d\n This story that they make such a clutter withal, what has it to do,\nI fain would know, with the contempt of pain?  He only fights it with\nwords, and in the meantime, if the shootings and dolours he felt did not\nmove him, why did he interrupt his discourse?  Why did he fancy he did so\ngreat a thing in forbearing to confess it an evil?  All does not here\nconsist in the imagination; our fancies may work upon other things: but\nhere is the certain science that is playing its part, of which our senses\nthemselves are judges:\n\n          \u201cQui nisi sunt veri, ratio quoque falsa sit omnis.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cWhich, if they be not true, all reasoning may also be false.\n     --\u201cLucretius, iv. 486.]\n\nShall we persuade our skins that the jerks of a whip agreeably tickle us,\nor our taste that a potion of aloes is vin de Graves?  Pyrrho\u2019s hog is\nhere in the same predicament with us; he is not afraid of death, \u2018tis\ntrue, but if you beat him he will cry out to some purpose.  Shall we\nforce the general law of nature, which in every living creature under\nheaven is seen to tremble under pain?  The very trees seem to groan under\nthe blows they receive.  Death is only felt by reason, forasmuch as it is\nthe motion of an instant;\n\n         \u201cAut fuit, aut veniet; nihil est praesentis in illa.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cDeath has been, or will come: there is nothing of the present in\n     it.\u201d--Estienne de la Boetie, Satires.]\n\n          \u201cMorsque minus poenae, quam mora mortis, habet;\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThe delay of death is more painful than death itself.\u201d\n      --Ovid, Ep. Ariadne to Theseus, v. 42.]\n\na thousand beasts, a thousand men, are sooner dead than threatened.  That\nalso which we principally pretend to fear in death is pain, its ordinary\nforerunner: yet, if we may believe a holy father:\n\n          \u201cMalam mortem non facit, nisi quod sequitur mortem.\u201d\n\n          [\u201cThat which follows death makes death bad.\u201d\n           --St. Augustin, De Civit. Dei, i. ii.]\n\nAnd I should yet say, more probably, that neither that which goes before\nnor that which follows after is at all of the appurtenances of death.\n\nWe excuse ourselves falsely: and I find by experience that it is rather\nthe impatience of the imagination of death that makes us impatient of\npain, and that we find it doubly grievous as it threatens us with death.\nBut reason accusing our cowardice for fearing a thing so sudden, so\ninevitable, and so insensible, we take the other as the more excusable\npretence.  All ills that carry no other danger along with them but simply\nthe evils themselves, we treat as things of no danger: the toothache or\nthe gout, painful as they are, yet being not reputed mortal, who reckons\nthem in the catalogue of diseases?\n\nBut let us presuppose that in death we principally regard the pain; as\nalso there is nothing to be feared in poverty but the miseries it brings\nalong with it of thirst, hunger, cold, heat, watching, and the other\ninconveniences it makes us suffer, still we have nothing to do with\nanything but pain.  I will grant, and very willingly, that it is the\nworst incident of our being (for I am the man upon earth who the most\nhates and avoids it, considering that hitherto, I thank God, I have had\nso little traffic with it), but still it is in us, if not to annihilate,\nat least to lessen it by patience; and though the body and the reason\nshould mutiny, to maintain the soul, nevertheless, in good condition.\nWere it not so, who had ever given reputation to virtue; valour, force,\nmagnanimity, and resolution?  where were their parts to be played if\nthere were no pain to be defied?\n\n               \u201cAvida est periculi virtus.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cCourage is greedy of danger.\u201d--Seneca, De Providentia, c. 4]\n\nWere there no lying upon the hard ground, no enduring, armed at all\npoints, the meridional heats, no feeding upon the flesh of horses and\nasses, no seeing a man\u2019s self hacked and hewed to pieces, no suffering a\nbullet to be pulled out from amongst the shattered bones, no sewing up,\ncauterising and searching of wounds, by what means were the advantage we\ncovet to have over the vulgar to be acquired?  \u2018Tis far from flying evil\nand pain, what the sages say, that of actions equally good, a man should\nmost covet to perform that wherein there is greater labour and pain.\n\n          \u201cNon est enim hilaritate, nec lascivia, nec risu, aut joco\n          comite levitatis, sed saepe etiam tristes firmitate et\n          constantia sunt beati.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cFor men are not only happy by mirth and wantonness, by laughter\n     and jesting, the companion of levity, but ofttimes the serious sort\n     reap felicity from their firmness and constancy.\u201d\n      --Cicero, De Finib. ii. 10.]\n\nAnd for this reason it has ever been impossible to persuade our\nforefathers but that the victories obtained by dint of force and the\nhazard of war were not more honourable than those performed in great\nsecurity by stratagem or practice:\n\n          \u201cLaetius est, quoties magno sibi constat honestum.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cA good deed is all the more a satisfaction by how much the more\n     it has cost us\u201d--Lucan, ix. 404.]\n\nBesides, this ought to be our comfort, that naturally, if the pain be\nviolent, \u2018tis but short; and if long, nothing violent:\n\n                        \u201cSi gravis, brevis;\n                         Si longus, levis.\u201d\n\nThou wilt not feel it long if thou feelest it too much; it will either\nput an end to itself or to thee; it comes to the same thing; if thou\ncanst not support it, it will export thee:\n\n     [\u201cRemember that the greatest pains are terminated by death; that\n     slighter pains have long intermissions of repose, and that we are\n     masters of the more moderate sort: so that, if they be tolerable,\n     we bear them; if not, we can go out of life, as from a theatre, when\n     it does not please us\u201d--Cicero, De Finib. i. 15.]\n\nThat which makes us suffer pain with so much impatience is the not being\naccustomed to repose our chiefest contentment in the soul; that we do not\nenough rely upon her who is the sole and sovereign mistress of our\ncondition.  The body, saving in the greater or less proportion, has but\none and the same bent and bias; whereas the soul is variable into all\nsorts of forms; and subject to herself and to her own empire, all things\nwhatsoever, both the senses of the body and all other accidents: and\ntherefore it is that we ought to study her, to inquire into her, and to\nrouse up all her powerful faculties.  There is neither reason, force, nor\nprescription that can anything prevail against her inclination and\nchoice.  Of so many thousands of biases that she has at her disposal, let\nus give her one proper to our repose and conversation, and then we shall\nnot only be sheltered and secured from all manner of injury and offence,\nbut moreover gratified and obliged, if she will, with evils and offences.\nShe makes her profit indifferently of all things; error, dreams, serve\nher to good use, as loyal matter to lodge us in safety and contentment.\n\u2018Tis plain enough to be seen that \u2018tis the sharpness of our mind that\ngives the edge to our pains and pleasures: beasts that have no such\nthing, leave to their bodies their own free and natural sentiments, and\nconsequently in every kind very near the same, as appears by the\nresembling application of their motions.  If we would not disturb in our\nmembers the jurisdiction that appertains to them in this, \u2018tis to be\nbelieved it would be the better for us, and that nature has given them a\njust and moderate temper both to pleasure and pain; neither can it fail\nof being just, being equal and common.  But seeing we have enfranchised\nourselves from her rules to give ourselves up to the rambling liberty of\nour own fancies, let us at least help to incline them to the most\nagreeable side.  Plato fears our too vehemently engaging ourselves with\npain and pleasure, forasmuch as these too much knit and ally the soul to\nthe body; whereas I rather, quite contrary, by reason it too much\nseparates and disunites them.  As an enemy is made more fierce by our\nflight, so pain grows proud to see us truckle under her.  She will\nsurrender upon much better terms to them who make head against her: a man\nmust oppose and stoutly set himself against her.  In retiring and giving\nground, we invite and pull upon ourselves the ruin that threatens us.  As\nthe body is more firm in an encounter, the more stiffly and obstinately\nit applies itself to it, so is it with the soul.\n\nBut let us come to examples, which are the proper game of folks of such\nfeeble force as myself; where we shall find that it is with pain as with\nstones, that receive a brighter or a duller lustre according to the foil\nthey are set in, and that it has no more room in us than we are pleased\nto allow it:\n\n          \u201cTantum doluerunt, quantum doloribus se inseruerunt.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThey suffered so much the more, by how much more they gave way to\n     suffering.\u201d--St. Augustin, De Civit. Dei, i. 10.]\n\nWe are more sensible of one little touch of a surgeon\u2019s lancet than of\ntwenty wounds with a sword in the heat of fight.  The pains of\nchildbearing, said by the physicians and by God himself to be great, and\nwhich we pass through with so many ceremonies--there are whole nations\nthat make nothing of them.  I set aside the Lacedaemonian women, but what\nelse do you find in the Swiss among our foot-soldiers, if not that, as\nthey trot after their husbands, you see them to-day carry the child at\ntheir necks that they carried yesterday in their bellies?  The\ncounterfeit Egyptians we have amongst us go themselves to wash theirs,\nso soon as they come into the world, and bathe in the first river they\nmeet.  Besides so many wenches as daily drop their children by stealth,\nas they conceived them, that fair and noble wife of Sabinus, a patrician\nof Rome, for another\u2019s interest, endured alone, without help, without\ncrying out, or so much as a groan, the bearing of twins.--[Plutarch, On\nLove, c.  34.]--A poor simple boy of Lacedaemon having stolen a fox (for\nthey more fear the shame of stupidity in stealing than we do the\npunishment of the knavery), and having got it under his coat, rather\nendured the tearing out of his bowels than he would discover his theft.\nAnd another offering incense at a sacrifice, suffered himself to be\nburned to the bone by a coal that fell into his sleeve, rather than\ndisturb the ceremony.  And there have been a great number, for a sole\ntrial of virtue, following their institutions, who have at seven years\nold endured to be whipped to death without changing their countenance.\nAnd Cicero has seen them fight in parties, with fists, feet, and teeth,\ntill they have fainted and sunk down, rather than confess themselves\novercome:\n\n     [\u201cCustom could never conquer nature; she is ever invincible; but we\n     have infected the mind with shadows, delights, negligence, sloth;\n     we have grown effeminate through opinions and corrupt morality.\u201d\n      --Cicero, Tusc. Quaes., v. 27.]\n\nEvery one knows the story of Scaevola, that having slipped into the\nenemy\u2019s camp to kill their general, and having missed his blow, to repair\nhis fault, by a more strange invention and to deliver his country, he\nboldly confessed to Porsenna, who was the king he had a purpose to kill,\nnot only his design, but moreover added that there were then in the camp\na great number of Romans, his accomplices in the enterprise, as good men\nas he; and to show what a one he himself was, having caused a pan of\nburning coals to be brought, he saw and endured his arm to broil and\nroast, till the king himself, conceiving horror at the sight, commanded\nthe pan to be taken away.  What would you say of him that would not\nvouchsafe to respite his reading in a book whilst he was under incision?\nAnd of the other that persisted to mock and laugh in contempt of the\npains inflicted upon him; so that the provoked cruelty of the\nexecutioners that had him in handling, and all the inventions of tortures\nredoubled upon him, one after another, spent in vain, gave him the\nbucklers?  But he was a philosopher.  But what! a gladiator of Caesar\u2019s\nendured, laughing all the while, his wounds to be searched, lanced, and\nlaid open:\n\n     [\u201cWhat ordinary gladiator ever groaned?  Which of them ever changed\n     countenance?  Which of them not only stood or fell indecorously?\n     Which, when he had fallen and was commanded to receive the stroke of\n     the sword, contracted his neck.\u201d--Cicero, Tusc. Quaes., ii. 17.]\n\n\nLet us bring in the women too.  Who has not heard at Paris of her that\ncaused her face to be flayed only for the fresher complexion of a new\nskin?  There are who have drawn good and sound teeth to make their voices\nmore soft and sweet, or to place the other teeth in better order.  How\nmany examples of the contempt of pain have we in that sex?  What can they\nnot do, what do they fear to do, for never so little hope of an addition\nto their beauty?\n\n               \u201cVallere queis cura est albos a stirpe capillos,\n               Et faciem, dempta pelle, referre novam.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cWho carefully pluck out their grey hairs by the roots, and renew\n     their faces by peeling off the old skin.\u201d--Tibullus, i. 8, 45.]\n\nI have seen some of them swallow sand, ashes, and do their utmost to\ndestroy their stomachs to get pale complexions.  To make a fine Spanish\nbody, what racks will they not endure of girding and bracing, till they\nhave notches in their sides cut into the very quick, and sometimes to\ndeath?\n\nIt is an ordinary thing with several nations at this day to wound\nthemselves in good earnest to gain credit to what they profess; of which\nour king, relates notable examples of what he has seen in Poland and done\ntowards himself.--[Henry III.]--But besides this, which I know to have\nbeen imitated by some in France, when I came from that famous assembly of\nthe Estates at Blois, I had a little before seen a maid in Picardy, who\nto manifest the ardour of her promises, as also her constancy, give\nherself, with a bodkin she wore in her hair, four or five good lusty\nstabs in the arm, till the blood gushed out to some purpose.  The Turks\ngive themselves great scars in honour of their mistresses, and to the end\nthey may the longer remain, they presently clap fire to the wound, where\nthey hold it an incredible time to stop the blood and form the cicatrice;\npeople that have been eyewitnesses of it have both written and sworn it\nto me.  But for ten aspers--[A Turkish coin worth about a penny]--there\nare there every day fellows to be found that will give themselves a good\ndeep slash in the arms or thighs.  I am willing, however, to have the\ntestimonies nearest to us when we have most need of them; for Christendom\nfurnishes us with enough.  After the example of our blessed Guide there\nhave been many who have crucified themselves.  We learn by testimony very\nworthy of belief, that King St. Louis wore a hair-shirt till in his old\nage his confessor gave him a dispensation to leave it off; and that every\nFriday he caused his shoulders to be drubbed by his priest with five\nsmall chains of iron which were always carried about amongst his night\naccoutrements for that purpose.\n\nWilliam, our last Duke of Guienne, the father of that Eleanor who\ntransmitted that duchy to the houses of France and England, continually\nfor the last ten or twelve years of his life wore a suit of armour under\na religious habit by way of penance.  Foulke, Count of Anjou, went as far\nas Jerusalem, there to cause himself to be whipped by two of his\nservants, with a rope about his neck, before the sepulchre of our Lord.\nBut do we not, moreover, every Good Friday, in various places, see great\nnumbers of men and women beat and whip themselves till they lacerate and\ncut the flesh to the very bones?  I have often seen it, and \u2018tis without\nany enchantment; and it was said there were some amongst them (for they\ngo disguised) who for money undertook by this means to save harmless the\nreligion of others, by a contempt of pain, so much the greater, as the\nincentives of devotion are more effectual than those of avarice.\nQ. Maximus buried his son when he was a consul, and M. Cato his when\npraetor elect, and L. Paulus both his, within a few days one after\nanother, with such a countenance as expressed no manner of grief.  I said\nonce merrily of a certain person, that he had disappointed the divine\njustice; for the violent death of three grown-up children of his being\none day sent him, for a severe scourge, as it is to be supposed, he was\nso far from being afflicted at the accident, that he rather took it for a\nparticular grace and favour of heaven.  I do not follow these monstrous\nhumours, though I lost two or three at nurse, if not without grief, at\nleast without repining, and yet there is hardly any accident that pierces\nnearer to the quick.  I see a great many other occasions of sorrow, that\nshould they happen to me I should hardly feel; and have despised some,\nwhen they have befallen me, to which the world has given so terrible a\nfigure that I should blush to boast of my constancy:\n\n         \u201cEx quo intelligitur, non in natura, sed in opinione,\n          esse aegritudinem.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cBy which one may understand that grief is not in nature, but in\n     opinion.\u201d--Cicero, Tusc. Quaes., iii. 28.]\n\nOpinion is a powerful party, bold, and without measure.  Who ever so\ngreedily hunted after security and repose as Alexander and Caesar did\nafter disturbance and difficulties?  Teres, the father of Sitalces, was\nwont to say that \u201cwhen he had no wars, he fancied there was no difference\nbetwixt him and his groom.\u201d  Cato the consul, to secure some cities of\nSpain from revolt, only interdicting the inhabitants from wearing arms, a\ngreat many killed themselves:\n\n          \u201cFerox gens, nullam vitam rati sine armis esse.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cA fierce people, who thought there was no life without war.\u201d\n      --Livy, xxxiv. 17.]\n\nHow many do we know who have forsaken the calm and sweetness of a quiet\nlife at home amongst their acquaintance, to seek out the horror of\nunhabitable deserts; and having precipitated themselves into so abject a\ncondition as to become the scorn and contempt of the world, have hugged\nthemselves with the conceit, even to affectation.  Cardinal Borromeo, who\ndied lately at Milan, amidst all the jollity that the air of Italy, his\nyouth, birth, and great riches, invited him to, kept himself in so\naustere a way of living, that the same robe he wore in summer served him\nfor winter too; he had only straw for his bed, and his hours of leisure\nfrom affairs he continually spent in study upon his knees, having a\nlittle bread and a glass of water set by his book, which was all the\nprovision of his repast, and all the time he spent in eating.\n\nI know some who consentingly have acquired both profit and advancement\nfrom cuckoldom, of which the bare name only affrights so many people.\n\nIf the sight be not the most necessary of all our senses, \u2018tis at least\nthe most pleasant; but the most pleasant and most useful of all our\nmembers seem to be those of generation; and yet a great many have\nconceived a mortal hatred against them only for this, that they were too\npleasant, and have deprived themselves of them only for their value:\nas much thought he of his eyes that put them out.  The generality and\nmore solid sort of men look upon abundance of children as a great\nblessing; I, and some others, think it as great a benefit to be without\nthem.  And when you ask Thales why he does not marry, he tells you,\nbecause he has no mind to leave any posterity behind him.\n\nThat our opinion gives the value to things is very manifest in the great\nnumber of those which we do, not so much prizing them, as ourselves, and\nnever considering either their virtues or their use, but only how dear\nthey cost us, as though that were a part of their substance; and we only\nrepute for value in them, not what they bring to us, but what we add to\nthem.  By which I understand that we are great economisers of our\nexpense: as it weighs, it serves for so much as it weighs.  Our opinion\nwill never suffer it to want of its value: the price gives value to the\ndiamond; difficulty to virtue; suffering to devotion; and griping to\nphysic.  A certain person, to be poor, threw his crowns into the same sea\nto which so many come, in all parts of the world, to fish for riches.\nEpicurus says  that to be rich is no relief, but only an alteration, of\naffairs.  In truth, it is not want, but rather abundance, that creates\navarice.  I will deliver my own experience concerning this affair.\n\nI have since my emergence from childhood lived in three sorts of\nconditions.  The first, which continued for some twenty years, I passed\nover without any other means but what were casual and depending upon the\nallowance and assistance of others, without stint, but without certain\nrevenue.  I then spent my money so much the more cheerfully, and with so\nmuch the less care how it went, as it wholly depended upon my\noverconfidence of fortune.  I never lived more at my ease; I never had\nthe repulse of finding the purse of any of my friends shut against me,\nhaving enjoined myself this necessity above all other necessities\nwhatever, by no means to fail of payment at the appointed time, which\nalso they have a thousand times respited, seeing how careful I was to\nsatisfy them; so that I practised at once a thrifty, and withal a kind of\nalluring, honesty.  I naturally feel a kind of pleasure in paying, as if\nI eased my shoulders of a troublesome weight and freed myself from an\nimage of slavery; as also that I find a ravishing kind of satisfaction in\npleasing another and doing a just action.  I except payments where the\ntrouble of bargaining and reckoning is required; and in such cases; where\nI can meet with nobody to ease me of that charge, I delay them, how\nscandalously and injuriously soever, all I possibly can, for fear of the\nwranglings for which both my humour and way of speaking are so totally\nimproper and unfit.  There is nothing I hate so much as driving a\nbargain; \u2018tis a mere traffic of cozenage and impudence, where, after an\nhour\u2019s cheapening and hesitating, both parties abandon their word and\noath for five sols\u2019 abatement.  Yet I always borrowed at great\ndisadvantage; for, wanting the confidence to speak to the person myself,\nI committed my request to the persuasion of a letter, which usually is no\nvery successful advocate, and is of very great advantage to him who has a\nmind to deny.  I, in those days, more jocundly and freely referred the\nconduct of my affairs to the stars, than I have since done to my own\nprovidence and judgment.  Most good managers look upon it as a horrible\nthing to live always thus in uncertainty, and do not consider, in the\nfirst place, that the greatest part of the world live so: how many worthy\nmen have wholly abandoned their own certainties, and yet daily do it, to\nthe winds, to trust to the inconstant favour of princes and of fortune?\nCaesar ran above a million of gold, more than he was worth, in debt to\nbecome Caesar; and how many merchants have begun their traffic by the\nsale of their farms, which they sent into the Indies,\n\n                    \u201cTot per impotentia freta.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThrough so many ungovernable seas.\u201d--Catullus, iv. 18.]\n\nIn so great a siccity of devotion as we see in these days, we have a\nthousand and a thousand colleges that pass it over commodiously enough,\nexpecting every day their dinner from the liberality of Heaven.\nSecondly, they do not take notice that this certitude upon which they so\nmuch rely is not much less uncertain and hazardous than hazard itself.\nI see misery as near beyond two thousand crowns a year as if it stood\nclose by me; for besides that it is in the power of chance to make a\nhundred breaches to poverty through the greatest strength of our riches\n--there being very often no mean betwixt the highest and the lowest\nfortune:\n\n          \u201cFortuna vitrea est: turn, quum splendet, frangitur,\u201d\n\n     [\u201cFortune is glass: in its greatest brightness it breaks.\u201d\n      --Ex Mim. P. Syrus.]\n\nand to turn all our barricadoes and bulwarks topsy-turvy, I find that, by\ndivers causes, indigence is as frequently seen to inhabit with those who\nhave estates as with those that have none; and that, peradventure, it is\nthen far less grievous when alone than when accompanied with riches.\nThese flow more from good management than from revenue;\n\n               \u201cFaber est suae quisque fortunae\u201d\n\n          [\u201cEvery one is the maker of his own fortune.\u201d\n           --Sallust, De Repub.  Ord., i. I.]\n\nand an uneasy, necessitous, busy, rich man seems to me more miserable\nthan he that is simply poor.\n\n     \u201cIn divitiis mopes, quod genus egestatis gravissimum est.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cPoor in the midst of riches, which is the sorest kind of poverty.\u201d\n      --Seneca, Ep., 74.]\n\nThe greatest and most wealthy princes are by poverty and want driven to\nthe most extreme necessity; for can there be any more extreme than to\nbecome tyrants and unjust usurpers of their subjects\u2019 goods and estates?\n\nMy second condition of life was to have money of my own, wherein I so\nordered the matter that I had soon laid up a very notable sum out of a\nmean fortune, considering with myself that that only was to be reputed\nhaving which a man reserves from his ordinary expense, and that a man\ncannot absolutely rely upon revenue he hopes to receive, how clear soever\nthe hope may be.  For what, said I, if I should be surprised by such or\nsuch an accident?  And after such-like vain and vicious imaginations,\nwould very learnedly, by this hoarding of money, provide against all\ninconveniences; and could, moreover, answer such as objected to me that\nthe number of these was too infinite, that if I could not lay up for all,\nI could, however, do it at least for some and for many.  Yet was not this\ndone without a great deal of solicitude and anxiety of mind; I kept it\nvery close, and though I dare talk so boldly of myself, never spoke of my\nmoney, but falsely, as others do, who being rich, pretend to be poor, and\nbeing poor, pretend to be rich, dispensing their consciences from ever\ntelling sincerely what they have: a ridiculous and shameful prudence.\nWas I going a journey?  Methought I was never enough provided: and the\nmore I loaded myself with money, the more also was I loaded with fear,\none while of the danger of the roads, another of the fidelity of him who\nhad the charge of my baggage, of whom, as some others that I know, I was\nnever sufficiently secure if I had him not always in my eye.  If I\nchanced to leave my cash-box behind me, O, what strange suspicions and\nanxiety of mind did I enter into, and, which was worse, without daring to\nacquaint anybody with it.  My mind was eternally taken up with such\nthings as these, so that, all things considered, there is more trouble in\nkeeping money than in getting it.  And if I did not altogether so much as\nI say, or was not really so scandalously solicitous of my money as I have\nmade myself out to be, yet it cost me something at least to restrain\nmyself from being so.  I reaped little or no advantage by what I had, and\nmy expenses seemed nothing less to me for having the more to spend; for,\nas Bion said, the hairy men are as angry as the bald to be pulled; and\nafter you are once accustomed to it and have once set your heart upon\nyour heap, it is no more at your service; you cannot find in your heart\nto break it: \u2018tis a building that you will fancy must of necessity all\ntumble down to ruin if you stir but the least pebble; necessity must\nfirst take you by the throat before you can prevail upon yourself to\ntouch it; and I would sooner have pawned anything I had, or sold a horse,\nand with much less constraint upon myself, than have made the least\nbreach in that beloved purse I had so carefully laid by.  But the danger\nwas that a man cannot easily prescribe certain limits to this desire\n(they are hard to find in things that a man conceives to be good), and to\nstint this good husbandry so that it may not degenerate into avarice: men\nstill are intent upon adding to the heap and increasing the stock from\nsum to sum, till at last they vilely deprive themselves of the enjoyment\nof their own proper goods, and throw all into reserve, without making any\nuse of them at all.  According to this rule, they are the richest people\nin the world who are set to guard the walls and gates of a wealthy city.\nAll moneyed men I conclude to be covetous.  Plato places corporal or\nhuman goods in this order: health, beauty, strength, riches; and riches,\nsays he, are not blind, but very clear-sighted, when illuminated by\nprudence.  Dionysius the son did a very handsome act upon this subject;\nhe was informed that one of the Syracusans had hid a treasure in the\nearth, and thereupon sent to the man to bring it to him, which he\naccordingly did, privately reserving a small part of it only to himself,\nwith which he went to another city, where being cured of his appetite of\nhoarding, he began to live at a more liberal rate; which Dionysius\nhearing, caused the rest of his treasure to be restored to him, saying,\nthat since he had learned to use it, he very willingly returned it back\nto him.\n\nI continued some years in this hoarding humour, when I know not what good\ndemon fortunately put me out of it, as he did the Syracusan, and made me\nthrow abroad all my reserve at random, the pleasure of a certain journey\nI took at very great expense having made me spurn this fond love of money\nunderfoot; by which means I am now fallen into a third way of living (I\nspeak what I think of it), doubtless much more pleasant and regular,\nwhich is, that I live at the height of my revenue; sometimes the one,\nsometimes the other may perhaps exceed, but \u2018tis very little and but\nrarely that they differ.  I live from hand to mouth, and content myself\nin having sufficient for my present and ordinary expense; for as to\nextraordinary occasions, all the laying up in the world would never\nsuffice.  And \u2018tis the greatest folly imaginable to expect that fortune\nshould ever sufficiently arm us against herself; \u2018tis with our own arms\nthat we are to fight her; accidental ones will betray us in the pinch of\nthe business.  If I lay up, \u2018tis for some near and contemplated purpose;\nnot to purchase lands, of which I have no need, but to purchase pleasure:\n\n     \u201cNon esse cupidum, pecunia est; non esse emacem, vertigal est.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cNot to be covetous, is money; not to be acquisitive, is revenue.\u201d\n      --Cicero, Paradox., vi. 3.]\n\nI neither am in any great apprehension of wanting, nor in desire of any\nmore:\n\n     \u201cDivinarum fructus est in copia; copiam declarat satietas.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThe fruit of riches is in abundance; satiety declares abundance.\u201d\n      --Idem, ibid., vi. 2.]\n\nAnd I am very well pleased that this reformation in me has fallen out in\nan age naturally inclined to avarice, and that I see myself cleared of a\nfolly so common to old men, and the most ridiculous of all human follies.\n\nFeraulez, a man that had run through both fortunes, and found that the\nincrease of substance was no increase of appetite either to eating or\ndrinking, sleeping or the enjoyment of his wife, and who on the other\nside felt the care of his economics lie heavy upon his shoulders, as it\ndoes on mine, was resolved to please a poor young man, his faithful\nfriend, who panted after riches, and made him a gift of all his, which\nwere excessively great, and, moreover, of all he was in the daily way of\ngetting by the liberality of Cyrus, his good master, and by the war;\nconditionally that he should take care handsomely to maintain and\nplentifully to entertain him as his guest and friend; which being\naccordingly done, they afterwards lived very happily together, both of\nthem equally content with the change of their condition.  \u2018Tis an example\nthat I could imitate with all my heart; and I very much approve the\nfortune of the aged prelate whom I see to have so absolutely stripped\nhimself of his purse, his revenue, and care of his expense, committing\nthem one while to one trusty servant, and another while to another, that\nhe has spun out a long succession of years, as ignorant, by this means,\nof his domestic affairs as a mere stranger.\n\nThe confidence in another man\u2019s virtue is no light evidence of a man\u2019s\nown, and God willingly favours such a confidence.  As to what concerns\nhim of whom I am speaking, I see nowhere a better governed house, more\nnobly and constantly maintained than his.  Happy to have regulated his\naffairs to so just a proportion that his estate is sufficient to do it\nwithout his care or trouble, and without any hindrance, either in the\nspending or laying it up, to his other more quiet employments, and more\nsuitable both to his place and liking.\n\nPlenty, then, and indigence depend upon the opinion every one has of\nthem; and riches no more than glory or health have other beauty or\npleasure than he lends them by whom they are possessed.\n\nEvery one is well or ill at ease, according as he so finds himself; not\nhe whom the world believes, but he who believes himself to be so, is\ncontent; and in this alone belief gives itself being and reality.\nFortune does us neither good nor hurt; she only presents us the matter\nand the seed, which our soul, more powerful than she, turns and applies\nas she best pleases; the sole cause and sovereign mistress of her own\nhappy or unhappy condition.  All external accessions receive taste and\ncolour from the internal constitution, as clothes warm us, not with their\nheat, but our own, which they are fit to cover and nourish; he who would\nshield therewith a cold body, would do the same service for the cold, for\nso snow and ice are preserved.  And, certes, after the same manner that\nstudy is a torment to an idle man, abstinence from wine to a drunkard,\nfrugality to the spendthrift, and exercise to a lazy, tender-bred fellow,\nso it is of all the rest.  The things are not so painful and difficult of\nthemselves, but our weakness or cowardice makes them so.  To judge of\ngreat, and high matters requires a suitable soul; otherwise we attribute\nthe vice to them which is really our own.  A straight oar seems crooked\nin the water it does not only import that we see the thing, but how and\nafter what manner we see it.\n\nAfter all this, why, amongst so many discourses that by so many arguments\npersuade men to despise death and to endure pain, can we not find out one\nthat helps us?  And of so many sorts of imaginations as have so prevailed\nupon others as to persuade them to do so, why does not every one apply\nsome one to himself, the most suitable to his own humour?  If he cannot\ndigest a strong-working decoction to eradicate the evil, let him at least\ntake a lenitive to ease it:\n\n     [\u201cIt is an effeminate and flimsy opinion, nor more so in pain than\n     in pleasure, in which, while we are at our ease, we cannot bear\n     without a cry the sting of a bee.  The whole business is to commend\n     thyself.\u201d--Cicero, Tusc.  Quaes., ii. 22.]\n\nAs to the rest, a man does not transgress philosophy by permitting the\nacrimony of pains and human frailty to prevail so much above measure; for\nthey constrain her to go back to her unanswerable replies: \u201cIf it be ill\nto live in necessity, at least there is no necessity upon a man to live\nin necessity\u201d: \u201cNo man continues ill long but by his own fault.\u201d  He who\nhas neither the courage to die nor the heart to live, who will neither\nresist nor fly, what can we do with him?\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLI\n\nNOT TO COMMUNICATE A MAN\u2019S HONOUR\n\nOf all the follies of the world, that which is most universally received\nis the solicitude of reputation and glory; which we are fond of to that\ndegree as to abandon riches, peace, life, and health, which are effectual\nand substantial goods, to pursue this vain phantom and empty word, that\nhas neither body nor hold to be taken of it:\n\n               La fama, ch\u2019invaghisce a un dolce suono\n               Gli superbi mortali, et par si bella,\n               E un eco, un sogno, anzi d\u2019un sogno un\u2019ombra,\n               Ch\u2019ad ogni vento si dilegua a sgombra.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cFame, which with alluring sound charms proud mortals, and appears\n     so fair, is but an echo, a dream, nay, the shadow of a dream, which\n     at every breath vanishes and dissolves.\u201d\n      --Tasso, Gerus., xiv. 63.]\n\nAnd of all the irrational humours of men, it should seem that the\nphilosophers themselves are among the last and the most reluctant to\ndisengage themselves from this: \u2018tis the most restive and obstinate of\nall:\n\n         \u201cQuia etiam bene proficientes animos tentare non cessat.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cBecause it ceases not to assail even well-directed minds\u201d\n      --St. Augustin, De Civit. Dei, v. 14.]\n\nThere is not any one of which reason so clearly accuses the vanity; but\nit is so deeply rooted in us that I dare not determine whether any one\never clearly discharged himself from it or no.  After you have said all\nand believed all has been said to its prejudice, it produces so intestine\nan inclination in opposition to your best arguments that you have little\npower to resist it; for, as Cicero says,  even those who most controvert\nit, would yet that the books they write about it should visit the light\nunder their own names, and seek to derive glory from seeming to despise\nit.  All other things are communicable and fall into commerce: we lend\nour goods and stake our lives for the necessity and service of our\nfriends; but to communicate a man\u2019s honour, and to robe another with a\nman\u2019s own glory, is very rarely seen.\n\nAnd yet we have some examples of that kind.  Catulus Luctatius in the\nCimbrian war, having done all that in him lay to make his flying soldiers\nface about upon the enemy, ran himself at last away with the rest, and\ncounterfeited the coward, to the end his men might rather seem to follow\ntheir captain than to fly from the enemy; which was to abandon his own\nreputation in order to cover the shame of others.  When Charles V. came\ninto Provence in the year 1537, \u2018tis said that Antonio de Leva, seeing\nthe emperor positively resolved upon this expedition, and believing it\nwould redound very much to his honour, did, nevertheless, very stiffly\noppose it in the council, to the end that the entire glory of that\nresolution should be attributed to his master, and that it might be said\nhis own wisdom and foresight had been such as that, contrary to the\nopinion of all, he had brought about so great an enterprise; which was to\ndo him honour at his own expense.  The Thracian ambassadors coming to\ncomfort Archileonida, the mother of Brasidas, upon the death of her son,\nand commending him to that height as to say he had not left his like\nbehind him, she rejected this private and particular commendation to\nattribute it to the public: \u201cTell me not that,\u201d said she; \u201cI know the\ncity of Sparta has many citizens both greater and of greater worth than\nhe.\u201d   In the battle of Crecy, the Prince of Wales, being then very\nyoung, had the vanguard committed to him: the main stress of the battle\nhappened to be in that place, which made the lords who were with him,\nfinding themselves overmatched, send to King Edward to advance to their\nrelief.  He inquired of the condition his son was in, and being answered\nthat he was alive and on horseback: \u201cI should, then, do him wrong,\u201d said\nthe king, \u201cnow to go and deprive him of the honour of winning this battle\nhe has so long and so bravely sustained; what hazard soever he runs, that\nshall be entirely his own\u201d; and, accordingly, would neither go nor send,\nknowing that if he went, it would be said all had been lost without his\nsuccour, and that the honour of the victory would be wholly attributed to\nhim.\n\n              \u201cSemper enim quod postremum adjectum est,\n               id rem totam videtur traxisse.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cFor always that which is last added, seems to have accomplished\n     the whole affair.\u201d--Livy, xxvii. 45.]\n\nMany at Rome thought, and would usually say, that the greatest of\nScipio\u2019s acts were in part due to Laelius, whose constant practice it was\nstill to advance and support Scipio\u2019s grandeur and renown, without any\ncare of his own.  And Theopompus, king of Sparta, to him who told him the\nrepublic could not miscarry since he knew so well how to command, \u201cTis\nrather,\u201d answered he, \u201cbecause the people know so well how to obey.\u201d\n As women succeeding to peerages had, notwithstanding their sex, the\nprivilege to attend and give their votes in the trials that appertained\nto the jurisdiction of peers; so the ecclesiastical peers,\nnotwithstanding their profession, were obliged to attend our kings in\ntheir wars, not only with their friends and servants, but in their own\npersons.  As the Bishop of Beauvais did, who being with Philip Augustus\nat the battle of Bouvines, had a notable share in that action; but he did\nnot think it fit for him to participate in the fruit and glory of that\nviolent and bloody trade.  He with his own hand reduced several of the\nenemy that day to his mercy, whom he delivered to the first gentleman he\nmet either to kill or receive them to quarter, referring the whole\nexecution to this other hand; and he did this with regard to William,\nEarl of Salisbury, whom he gave up to Messire Jehan de Nesle.  With a\nlike subtlety of conscience to that I have just named, he would kill but\nnot wound, and for that reason ever fought with a mace.  And a certain\nperson of my time, being reproached by the king that he had laid hands on\na priest, stiffly and positively denied he had done any such thing: the\nmeaning of which was, he had cudgelled and kicked him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLII\n\nOF THE INEQUALITY AMOUNGST US.\n\nPlutarch says somewhere that he does not find so great a difference\nbetwixt beast and beast as he does betwixt man and man; which he says in\nreference to the internal qualities and perfections of the soul.  And, in\ntruth, I find so vast a distance betwixt Epaminondas, according to my\njudgment of him, and some that I know, who are yet men of good sense,\nthat I could willingly enhance upon Plutarch, and say that there is more\ndifference betwixt such and such a man than there is betwixt such a man\nand such a beast:\n\n          [\u201cAh! how much may one man surpass another!\u201d\n           --Terence, Eunuchus, ii. 2.]\n\nand that there are as many and innumerable degrees of mind as there are\ncubits betwixt this and heaven.  But as touching the estimate of men,\n\u2018tis strange that, ourselves excepted, no other creature is esteemed\nbeyond its proper qualities; we commend a horse for his strength and\nsureness of foot,\n\n                              \u201cVolucrem\n               Sic laudamus equum, facili cui plurima palma\n               Fervet, et exsultat rauco victoria circo,\u201d\n\n     [\u201cSo we praise the swift horse, for whose easy mastery many a hand\n     glows in applause, and victory exults in the hoarse circus.\n     --\u201cJuvenal, viii. 57.]\n\nand not for his rich caparison; a greyhound for his speed of heels, not\nfor his fine collar; a hawk for her wing, not for her gesses and bells.\nWhy, in like manner, do we not value a man for what is properly his own?\nHe has a great train, a beautiful palace, so much credit, so many\nthousand pounds a year: all these are about him, but not in him.  You\nwill not buy a pig in a poke: if you cheapen a horse, you will see him\nstripped of his housing-cloths, you will see him naked and open to your\neye; or if he be clothed, as they anciently were wont to present them to\nprinces to sell, \u2018tis only on the less important parts, that you may not\nso much consider the beauty of his colour or the breadth of his crupper,\nas principally to examine his legs, eyes, and feet, which are the members\nof greatest use:\n\n         \u201cRegibus hic mos est: ubi equos mercantur, opertos\n          Inspiciunt; ne, si facies, ut saepe, decora\n          Molli fulta pede est, emptorem inducat hiantem\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThis is the custom of kings: when they buy horses, they have open\n     inspection, lest, if a fair head, as often chances, is supported by\n     a weak foot, it should tempt the gaping purchaser.\u201d\n      --Horace, Sat., i. 2, 86.]\n\nwhy, in giving your estimate of a man, do you prize him wrapped and\nmuffled up in clothes?  He then discovers nothing to you but such parts\nas are not in the least his own, and conceals those by which alone one\nmay rightly judge of his value.  \u2018Tis the price of the blade that you\ninquire into, not of the scabbard: you would not peradventure bid a\nfarthing for him, if you saw him stripped.  You are to judge him by\nhimself and not by what he wears; and, as one of the ancients very\npleasantly said: \u201cDo you know why you repute him tall?  You reckon withal\nthe height of his pattens.\u201d--[Seneca, Ep. 76.]--The pedestal is no part\nof the statue.  Measure him without his stilts; let him lay aside his\nrevenues and his titles; let him present himself in his shirt. Then\nexamine if his body be sound and sprightly, active and disposed to\nperform its functions.  What soul has he?  Is she beautiful, capable, and\nhappily provided of all her faculties?  Is she rich of what is her own,\nor of what she has borrowed?  Has fortune no hand in the affair?  Can\nshe, without winking, stand the lightning of swords? is she indifferent\nwhether her life expire by the mouth or through the throat?  Is she\nsettled, even and content?  This is what is to be examined, and by that\nyou are to judge of the vast differences betwixt man and man.  Is he:\n\n          \u201cSapiens, sibique imperiosus,\n          Quern neque pauperies, neque mors, neque vincula terrent;\n          Responsare cupidinibus, contemnere honores\n          Fortis; et in seipso totus teres atque rotundus,\n          Externi ne quid valeat per laeve morari;\n          In quem manca ruit semper fortuna?\u201d\n\n\n     [\u201cThe wise man, self-governed, whom neither poverty, nor death,\n     nor chains affright: who has the strength to resist his appetites\n     and to contemn honours: who is wholly self-contained: whom no\n     external objects affect: whom fortune assails in vain.\u201d\n      --Horace, Sat., ii. 7,]\n\nsuch a man is five hundred cubits above kingdoms and duchies; he is an\nabsolute monarch in and to himself:\n\n          \u201cSapiens, .  .  .

And yet they are no other than\npictures that make no essential dissimilitude; for as you see actors in a\nplay representing the person of a duke or an emperor upon the stage, and\nimmediately after return to their true and original condition of valets\nand porters, so the emperor, whose pomp and lustre so dazzle you in\npublic:\n\n               \u201cScilicet grandes viridi cum luce smaragdi\n               Auto includuntur, teriturque thalassina vestis\n               Assidue, et Veneris sudorem exercita potat;\u201d\n\n     [\u201cBecause he wears great emeralds richly set in gold, darting green\n     lustre; and the sea-blue silken robe, worn with pressure, and moist\n     with illicit love (and absorbs the sweat of Venus).\u201d\n      --Lucretius, iv. 1123.]\n\ndo but peep behind the curtain, and you will see no thing more than an\nordinary man, and peradventure more contemptible than the meanest of his\nsubjects:\n\n     \u201cIlle beatus introrsum est, istius bracteata felicitas est;\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThe one is happy in himself; the happiness of the other is\n     counterfeit.\u201d--Seneca, Ep., 115.]\n\ncowardice, irresolution, ambition, spite, and envy agitate him as much as\nanother:\n\n              \u201cNon enim gazae, neque consularis\n               Submovet lictor miseros tumultus\n               Mentis, et curas laqueata circum\n               Tecta volantes.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cFor not treasures, nor the consular lictor, can remove the\n     miserable tumults of the mind, nor cares that fly about panelled\n     ceilings.\u201d--Horace, Od., ii. 16, 9.]\n\nCare and fear attack him even in the centre of his battalions:\n\n               \u201cRe veraque metus hominum curaeque sequaces\n               Nec metuunt sonitus armorum, nee fera tela;\n               Audacterque inter reges, rerumque potentes\n               Versantur, neque fulgorem reverentur ab auro.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cAnd in truth the fears and haunting cares of men fear not the\n     clash of arms nor points of darts, and mingle boldly with great\n     kings and men in authority, nor respect the glitter of gold.\u201d\n      --Lucretius, ii. 47.]\n\nDo fevers, gout, and apoplexies spare him any more than one of us?

To him who is covetous or timorous his house and\n     estate are as a picture to a blind man, or a fomentation to a\n     gouty.\u201d--Horace, Ep., i. 2, 47.]\n\nHe is a sot, his taste is palled and flat; he no more enjoys what he has\nthan one that has a cold relishes the flavour of canary, or than a horse\nis sensible of his rich caparison.  Plato is in the right when he tells\nus that health, beauty, vigour, and riches, and all the other things\ncalled goods, are equally evil to the unjust as good to the just, and the\nevil on the contrary the same.  And therefore where the body and the mind\nare in disorder, to what use serve these external conveniences:\nconsidering that the least prick with a pin, or the least passion of the\nsoul, is sufficient to deprive one of the pleasure of being sole monarch\nof the world.

Nay, perhaps he\nwould be of King Seleucus\u2019 opinion, that he who knew the weight of a\nsceptre would not stoop to pick it up, if he saw it lying before him, so\ngreat and painful are the duties incumbent upon a good king.--[Plutarch,\nIf a Sage should Meddle with Affairs of Stale, c. 12.]--Assuredly it can\nbe no easy task to rule others, when we find it so hard a matter to\ngovern ourselves; and as to dominion, that seems so charming, the frailty\nof human judgment and the difficulty of choice in things that are new and\ndoubtful considered, I am very much of opinion that it is far more easy\nand pleasant to follow than to lead; and that it is a great settlement\nand satisfaction of mind to have only one path to walk in, and to have\nnone to answer for but a man\u2019s self;\n\n               \u201cUt satius multo jam sit parere quietum,\n               Quam regere imperio res velle.\u201d\n\n     [\u201c\u2018Tis much better quietly to obey than wish to rule.\u201d\n      --Lucretius, V, 1126.]\n\nTo which we may add that saying of Cyrus, that no man was fit to rule but\nhe who in his own worth was of greater value than those he was to govern;\nbut King Hiero in Xenophon says further, that in the fruition even of\npleasure itself they are in a worse condition than private men; forasmuch\nas the opportunities and facility they have of commanding those things at\nwill takes off from the delight that ordinary folks enjoy:\n\n          \u201cPinguis amor, nimiumque patens, in taedia nobis\n          Vertitur, et, stomacho dulcis ut esca, nocet.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cLove in excess and too palpable turns to weariness, and, like\n     sweetmeats to the stomach, is injurious.\u201d--Ovid, Amoy., ii. 19, 25.]\n\nCan we think that the singing boys of the choir take any great delight in\nmusic?  the satiety rather renders it troublesome and tedious to them.\nFeasts, balls, masquerades and tiltings delight such as but rarely see,\nand desire to see, them; but having been frequently at such\nentertainments, the relish of them grows flat and insipid.  Nor do women\nso much delight those who make a common practice of the sport.  He who\nwill not give himself leisure to be thirsty can never find the true\npleasure of drinking.  Farces and tumbling tricks are pleasant to the\nspectators, but a wearisome toil to those by whom they are performed.\nAnd that this is so, we see that princes divert themselves sometimes in\ndisguising their quality, awhile to depose themselves, and to stoop to\nthe poor and ordinary way of living of the meanest of their people.\n\n              \u201cPlerumque gratae divitibus vices\n               Mundaeque parvo sub lare pauperum\n               Coenae, sine aulaeis et ostro,\n               Soliicitam explicuere frontem.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThe rich are often pleased with variety; and the plain supper in a\n     poor cottage, without tapestry and purple, has relaxed the anxious\n     brow.\u201d--Horace, Od., iii.  29, 13.]\n\nNothing is so distasteful and clogging as abundance.  What appetite would\nnot be baffled to see three hundred women at its mercy, as the grand\nsignor has in his seraglio?  And, of his ancestors what fruition or taste\nof sport did he reserve to himself, who never went hawking without seven\nthousand falconers?  And besides all this, I fancy that this lustre of\ngrandeur brings with it no little disturbance and uneasiness upon the\nenjoyment of the most tempting pleasures; the great are too conspicuous\nand lie too open to every one\u2019s view.  Neither do I know to what end a\nman should more require of them to conceal their errors, since what is\nonly reputed indiscretion in us, the people in them brand with the names\nof tyranny and contempt of the laws, and, besides their proclivity to\nvice, are apt to hold that it is a heightening of pleasure to them, to\ninsult over and to trample upon public observances.  Plato, indeed, in\nhis Goygias, defines a tyrant to be one who in a city has licence to do\nwhatever his own will leads him to do; and by reason of this impunity,\nthe display and publication of their vices do ofttimes more mischief than\nthe vice itself.  Every one fears to be pried into and overlooked; but\nprinces are so, even to their very gestures, looks and thoughts, the\npeople conceiving they have right and title to be judges of them besides\nthat the blemishes of the great naturally appear greater by reason of the\neminence and lustre of the place where they are seated, and that a mole\nor a wart appears greater in them than a wide gash in others.  And this\nis the reason why the poets feign the amours of Jupiter to be performed\nin the disguises of so many borrowed shapes, and that amongst the many\namorous practices they lay to his charge, there is only one, as I\nremember, where he appears in his own majesty and grandeur.\n\nBut let us return to Hiero, who further complains of the inconveniences\nhe found in his royalty, in that he could not look abroad and travel the\nworld at liberty, being as it were a prisoner in the bounds and limits of\nhis own dominion, and that in all his actions he was evermore surrounded\nwith an importunate crowd.  And in truth, to see our kings sit all alone\nat table, environed with so many people prating about them, and so many\nstrangers staring upon them, as they always are, I have often been moved\nrather to pity than to envy their condition.  King Alfonso was wont to\nsay, that in this asses were in a better condition than kings, their\nmasters permitting them to feed at their own ease and pleasure, a favour\nthat kings cannot obtain of their servants.  And it has never come into\nmy fancy that it could be of any great benefit to the life of a man of\nsense to have twenty people prating about him when he is at stool; or\nthat the services of a man of ten thousand livres a year, or that has\ntaken Casale or defended Siena, should be either more commodious or more\nacceptable to him, than those of a good groom of the chamber who\nunderstands his place.  The advantages of sovereignty are in a manner but\nimaginary: every degree of fortune has in it some image of principality.\nCaesar calls all the lords of France, having free franchise within their\nown demesnes, roitelets or petty kings; and in truth, the name of sire\nexcepted, they go pretty far towards kingship; for do but look into the\nprovinces remote from court, as Brittany for example; take notice of the\ntrain, the vassals, the officers, the employments, service, ceremony, and\nstate of a lord who lives retired from court in his own house, amongst\nhis own tenants and servants; and observe withal the flight of his\nimagination; there is nothing more royal; he hears talk of his master\nonce a year, as of a king of Persia, without taking any further\nrecognition of him, than by some remote kindred his secretary keeps in\nsome register.  And, to speak the truth, our laws are easy enough, so\neasy that a gentleman of France scarce feels the weight of sovereignty\npinch his shoulders above twice in his life.  Real and effectual\nsubjection only concerns such amongst us as voluntarily thrust their\nnecks under the yoke, and who design to get wealth and honours by such\nservices: for a man that loves his own fireside, and can govern his house\nwithout falling by the ears with his neighbours or engaging in suits of\nlaw, is as free as a Duke of Venice.\n\n               \u201cPaucos servitus, plures servitutem tenent.\u201d\n\n          [\u201cServitude enchains few, but many enchain themselves to\n          servitude.\u201d--Seneca, Ep., 22.]\n\nBut that which Hiero is most concerned at is, that he finds himself\nstripped of all friendship, deprived of all mutual society, wherein the\ntrue and most perfect fruition of human life consists.  For what\ntestimony of affection and goodwill can I extract from him that owes me,\nwhether he will or no, all that he is able to do?  Can I form any\nassurance of his real respect to me, from his humble way of speaking and\nsubmissive behaviour, when these are ceremonies it is not in his choice\nto deny?  The honour we receive from those that fear us is not honour;\nthose respects are due to royalty and not to me:\n\n               \u201cMaximum hoc regni bonum est\n               Quod facta domini cogitur populus sui\n               Quam ferre, tam laudare.\u201d\n\n     [\u201c\u2018Tis the greatest benefit of a kingdom that the people is forced\n     to commend, as well as to bear the acts of the ruler.\u201d\n      --Seneca, Thyestes, ii.  i, 30.]\n\nDo I not see that the wicked and the good king, he that is hated and he\nthat is beloved, have the one as much reverence paid him as the other?\nMy predecessor was, and my successor shall be, served with the same\nceremony and state.  If my subjects do me no harm, \u2018tis no evidence of\nany good affection; why should I look upon it as such, seeing it is not\nin their power to do it if they would?  No one follows me or obeys my\ncommands upon the account of any friendship, betwixt him and me; there\ncan be no contracting of friendship where there is so little relation and\ncorrespondence: my own height has put me out of the familiarity of and\nintelligence with men; there is too great disparity and disproportion\nbetwixt us.  They follow me either upon the account of decency and\ncustom; or rather my fortune, than me, to increase their own.  All they\nsay to me or do for me is but outward paint, appearance, their liberty\nbeing on all parts restrained by the great power and authority I have\nover them.  I see nothing about me but what is dissembled and disguised.\n\nThe Emperor Julian being one day applauded by his courtiers for his exact\njustice: \u201cI should be proud of these praises,\u201d said he, \u201cdid they come\nfrom persons that durst condemn or disapprove the contrary, in case I\nshould do it.\u201d  All the real advantages of princes are common to them\nwith men of meaner condition (\u2018tis for the gods to mount winged horses\nand feed upon ambrosia): they have no other sleep, nor other appetite\nthan we; the steel they arm themselves withal is of no better temper than\nthat we also use; their crowns neither defend them from the rain nor the\nsun.\n\nDiocletian, who wore a crown so fortunate and revered, resigned it to\nretire to the felicity of a private life; and some time after the\nnecessity of public affairs requiring that he should reassume his charge,\nhe made answer to those who came to court him to it: \u201cYou would not\noffer,\u201d said he, \u201cto persuade me to this, had you seen the fine order of\nthe trees I have planted in my orchard, and the fair melons I have sown\nin my garden.\u201d\n\nIn Anacharsis\u2019 opinion, the happiest state of government would be where,\nall other things being equal, precedence should be measured out by the\nvirtues, and repulses by the vices of men.\n\nWhen King Pyrrhus prepared for his expedition into Italy, his wise\ncounsellor Cyneas, to make him sensible of the vanity of his ambition:\n\u201cWell, sir,\u201d said he, \u201cto what end do you make all this mighty\npreparation?\u201d--\u201cTo make myself master of Italy,\u201d replied the king.\n\u201cAnd what after that  is done?\u201d said Cyneas.  \u201cI will pass over into Gaul\nand Spain,\u201d said the other.  \u201cAnd what then?\u201d--\u201cI will then go to subdue\nAfrica; and lastly, when I have brought the whole world to my subjection,\nI will sit down and rest content at my own ease.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor God sake, sir,\u201d replied Cyneas, \u201ctell me what hinders that you may\nnot, if you please, be now in the condition you speak of?  Why do you not\nnow at this instant settle yourself in the state you seem to aim at, and\nspare all the labour and hazard you interpose?\u201d\n\n         \u201cNimirum, quia non cognovit, qux esset habendi\n          Finis, et omnino quoad crescat vera voluptas.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cForsooth because he does not know what should be the limit of\n     acquisition, and altogether how far real pleasure should increase.\u201d\n      --Lucretius, v. 1431]\n\nI will conclude with an old versicle, that I think very apt to the\npurpose:\n\n               \u201cMores cuique sui fingunt fortunam.\u201d\n\n               [\u201cEvery man frames his own fortune.\u201d\n                --Cornelius Nepos, Life of Atticus]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIII\n\nOF SUMPTUARY LAWS\n\nThe way by which our laws attempt to regulate idle and vain expenses in\nmeat and clothes, seems to be quite contrary to the end designed.  The\ntrue way would be to beget in men a contempt of silks and gold, as vain,\nfrivolous, and useless; whereas we augment to them the honours, and\nenhance the value of such things, which, sure, is a very improper way to\ncreate a disgust.  For to enact that none but princes shall eat turbot,\nshall wear velvet or gold lace, and interdict these things to the people,\nwhat is it but to bring them into a greater esteem, and to set every one\nmore agog to eat and wear them?  Let kings leave off these ensigns of\ngrandeur; they have others enough besides; those excesses are more\nexcusable in any other than a prince.  We may learn by the example of\nseveral nations better ways of exterior distinction of quality (which,\ntruly, I conceive to be very requisite in a state) enough, without\nfostering to this purpose such corruption and manifest inconvenience.\n\u2018Tis strange how suddenly and with how much ease custom in these\nindifferent things establishes itself and becomes authority.  We had\nscarce worn cloth a year, in compliance with the court, for the mourning\nof Henry II., but that silks were already grown into such contempt with\nevery one, that a man so clad was presently concluded a citizen: silks\nwere divided betwixt the physicians and surgeons, and though all other\npeople almost went in the same habit, there was, notwithstanding, in one\nthing or other, sufficient distinction of the several conditions of men.\nHow suddenly do greasy chamois and linen doublets become the fashion in\nour armies, whilst all neatness and richness of habit fall into contempt?\nLet kings but lead the dance and begin to leave off this expense, and in\na month the business will be done throughout the kingdom, without edict\nor ordinance; we shall all follow.  It should be rather proclaimed, on\nthe contrary, that no one should wear scarlet or goldsmiths\u2019 work but\ncourtesans and tumblers.\n\nZeleucus by the like invention reclaimed the corrupted manners of the\nLocrians.  His laws were, that no free woman should be allowed any more\nthan one maid to follow her, unless she was drunk: nor was to stir out of\nthe city by night, wear jewels of gold about her, or go in an embroidered\nrobe, unless she was a professed and public prostitute; that, bravos\nexcepted, no man was to wear a gold ring, nor be seen in one of those\neffeminate robes woven in the city of Miletus.  By which infamous\nexceptions he discreetly diverted his citizens from superfluities and\npernicious pleasures, and it was a project of great utility to attract\nthen by honour and ambition to their duty and obedience.\n\nOur kings can do what they please in such external reformations; their\nown inclination stands in this case for a law:\n\n          \u201cQuicquid principes faciunt, praecipere videntur.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cWhat princes themselves do, they seem to prescribe.\u201d\n      --Quintil., Declam., 3.]\n\nWhatever is done at court passes for a rule through the rest of France.\nLet the courtiers fall out with these abominable breeches, that discover\nso much of those parts should be concealed; these great bellied doublets,\nthat make us look like I know not what, and are so unfit to admit of\narms; these long effeminate locks of hair; this foolish custom of kissing\nwhat we present to our equals, and our hands in saluting them, a ceremony\nin former times only due to princes.  Let them not permit that a\ngentleman shall appear in place of respect without his sword, unbuttoned\nand untrussed, as though he came from the house of office; and that,\ncontrary to the custom of our forefathers and the particular privilege of\nthe nobles of this kingdom, we stand a long time bare to them in what\nplace soever, and the same to a hundred others, so many tiercelets and\nquartelets of kings we have got nowadays and other like vicious\ninnovations: they will see them all presently vanish and cried down.\nThese are, \u2018tis true, but superficial errors; but they are of ill augury,\nand enough to inform us that the whole fabric is crazy and tottering,\nwhen we see the roughcast of our walls to cleave and split.\n\nPlato in his Laws esteems nothing of more pestiferous consequence to his\ncity than to give young men the liberty of introducing any change in\ntheir habits, gestures, dances, songs, and exercises, from one form to\nanother; shifting from this to that, hunting after novelties, and\napplauding the inventors; by which means manners are corrupted and the\nold institutions come to be nauseated and despised.  In all things,\nsaving only in those that are evil, a change is to be feared; even the\nchange of seasons, winds, viands, and humours.  And no laws are in their\ntrue credit, but such to which God has given so long a continuance that\nno one knows their beginning, or that there ever was any other.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIV\n\nOF SLEEP\n\nReason directs that we should always go the same way, but not always at\nthe same pace.  And, consequently, though a wise man ought not so much to\ngive the reins to human passions as to let him deviate from the right\npath, he may, notwithstanding, without prejudice to his duty, leave it to\nthem to hasten or to slacken his speed, and not fix himself like a\nmotionless and insensible Colossus.  Could virtue itself put on flesh and\nblood, I believe the pulse would beat faster going on to assault than in\ngoing to dinner: that is to say, there is a necessity she should heat and\nbe moved upon this account.  I have taken notice, as of an extraordinary\nthing, of some great men, who in the highest enterprises and most\nimportant affairs have kept themselves in so settled and serene a calm,\nas not at all to break their sleep.  Alexander the Great, on the day\nassigned for that furious battle betwixt him and Darius, slept so\nprofoundly and so long in the morning, that Parmenio was forced to enter\nhis chamber, and coming to his bedside, to call him several times by his\nname, the time to go to fight compelling him so to do.  The Emperor Otho,\nhaving put on a resolution to kill himself that night, after having\nsettled his domestic affairs, divided his money amongst his servants, and\nset a good edge upon a sword he had made choice of for the purpose, and\nnow staying only to be satisfied whether all his friends had retired in\nsafety, he fell into so sound a sleep that the gentlemen of his chamber\nheard him snore.  The death of this emperor has in it circumstances\nparalleling that of the great Cato, and particularly this just related\nfor Cato being ready to despatch himself, whilst he only stayed his hand\nin expectation of the return of a messenger he had sent to bring him news\nwhether the senators he had sent away were put out from the Port of\nUtica, he fell into so sound a sleep, that they heard him snore in the\nnext room; and the man, whom he had sent to the port, having awakened him\nto let him know that the tempestuous weather had hindered the senators\nfrom putting to sea, he despatched away another messenger, and composing\nagain himself in the bed, settled to sleep, and slept till by the return\nof the last messenger he had certain intelligence they were gone.  We may\nhere further compare him with Alexander in the great and dangerous storm\nthat threatened him by the sedition of the tribune Metellus, who,\nattempting to publish a decree for the calling in of Pompey with his army\ninto the city at the time of Catiline\u2019s conspiracy, was only and that\nstoutly opposed by Cato, so that very sharp language and bitter menaces\npassed betwixt them in the senate about that affair; but it was the next\nday, in the forenoon, that the controversy was to be decided, where\nMetellus, besides the favour of the people and of Caesar--at that time of\nPompey\u2019s faction--was to appear accompanied with a rabble of slaves and\ngladiators; and Cato only fortified with his own courage and constancy;\nso that his relations, domestics, and many virtuous people of his friends\nwere in great apprehensions for him; and to that degree, that some there\nwere who passed over the whole night without sleep, eating, or drinking,\nfor the danger they saw him running into; his wife and sisters did\nnothing but weep and torment themselves in his house; whereas, he, on the\ncontrary, comforted every one, and after having supped after his usual\nmanner, went to bed, and slept profoundly till morning, when one of his\nfellow-tribunes roused him to go to the encounter.  The knowledge we have\nof the greatness of this man\u2019s courage by the rest of his life, may\nwarrant us certainly to judge that his indifference proceeded from a soul\nso much elevated above such accidents, that he disdained to let it take\nany more hold of his fancy than any ordinary incident.\n\nIn the naval engagement that Augustus won of Sextus Pompeius in Sicily,\njust as they were to begin the fight, he was so fast asleep that his\nfriends were compelled to wake him to give the signal of battle: and this\nwas it that gave Mark Antony afterwards occasion to reproach him that he\nhad not the courage so much as with open eyes to behold the order of his\nown squadrons, and not to have dared to present himself before the\nsoldiers, till first Agrippa had brought him news of the victory\nobtained.  But as to the young Marius, who did much worse (for the day of\nhis last battle against Sylla, after he had marshalled his army and given\nthe word and signal of battle, he laid him down under the shade of a tree\nto repose himself, and fell so fast asleep that the rout and flight of\nhis men could hardly waken him, he having seen nothing of the fight), he\nis said to have been at that time so extremely spent and worn out with\nlabour and want of sleep, that nature could hold out no longer.  Now,\nupon what has been said, the physicians may determine whether sleep be so\nnecessary that our lives depend upon it: for we read that King Perseus of\nMacedon, being prisoner at Rome, was killed by being kept from sleep; but\nPliny instances such as have lived long without sleep.  Herodotus speaks\nof nations where the men sleep and wake by half-years, and they who write\nthe life of the sage Epimenides affirm that he slept seven-and-fifty\nyears together.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLV\n\nOF THE BATTLE OF DREUX\n\n     [December 19, 1562, in which the Catholics, under the command of the\n     Duc de Guise and the Constable de Montmorenci, defeated the\n     Protestants, commanded by the Prince de Conde.  See Sismondi, Hist.\n     des Francais, vol.  xviii., p. 354.]\n\nOur battle of Dreux is remarkable for several extraordinary incidents;\nbut such as have no great kindness for M. de Guise, nor much favour his\nreputation, are willing to have him thought to blame, and that his making\na halt and delaying time with the forces he commanded, whilst the\nConstable, who was general of the army, was racked through and through\nwith the enemy\u2019s artillery, his battalion routed, and himself taken\nprisoner, is not to be excused; and that he had much better have run the\nhazard of charging the enemy in flank, than staying for the advantage of\nfalling in upon the rear, to suffer so great and so important a loss.\nBut, besides what the event demonstrated, he who will consider it without\npassion or prejudice will easily be induced to confess that the aim and\ndesign, not of a captain only, but of every private soldier, ought to\nregard the victory in general, and that no particular occurrences, how\nnearly soever they may concern his own interest, should divert him from\nthat pursuit.  Philopoemen,  in an encounter with Machanidas, having sent\nbefore a good strong party of his archers and slingers to begin the\nskirmish, and these being routed and hotly pursued by the enemy, who,\npushing on the fortune of their arms, and in that pursuit passing by the\nbattalion where Philopoemen was, though his soldiers were impatient to\nfall on, he did not think fit to stir from his post nor to present\nhimself to the enemy to relieve his men, but having suffered these to be\nchased and cut in pieces before his face, charged in upon the enemy\u2019s\nfoot when he saw them left unprotected by the horse, and notwithstanding\nthat they were Lacedaemonians, yet taking them in the nick, when thinking\nthemselves secure of the victory, they began to disorder their ranks; he\ndid this business with great facility, and then put himself in pursuit of\nMachanidas.  Which case is very like that of Monsieur de Guise.\n\nIn that bloody battle betwixt Agesilaus and the Boeotians, which\nXenophon, who was present at it, reports to be the sharpest that he had\never seen, Agesilaus waived the advantage that fortune presented him, to\nlet the Boeotian battalions pass by and then to charge them in the rear,\nhow certain soever he might make himself of the victory, judging it would\nrather be an effect of conduct than valour, to proceed that way; and\ntherefore, to show his prowess, rather chose with a marvellous ardour of\ncourage to charge them in the front; but he was well beaten and well\nwounded for his pains, and constrained at last to disengage himself, and\nto take the course he had at first neglected; opening his battalion to\ngive way to this torrent of Boeotians, and they being passed by, taking\nnotice that they marched in disorder, like men who thought themselves out\nof danger, he pursued and charged them in flank; yet could not so prevail\nas to bring it to so general a rout but that they leisurely retreated,\nstill facing about upon him till they had retired to safety.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVI\n\nOF NAMES\n\nWhat variety of herbs soever are shufed together in the dish, yet the\nwhole mass is swallowed up under one name of a sallet.  In like manner,\nunder the consideration of names, I will make a hodge-podge of divers\narticles.\n\nEvery nation has certain names, that, I know not why, are taken in no\ngood sense, as with us, John, William, Benedict.  In the genealogy of\nprinces, also, there seem to be certain names fatally affected, as the\nPtolemies of Egypt, the Henries in England, the Charleses in France, the\nBaldwins in Flanders, and the Williams of our ancient Aquitaine, from\nwhence, \u2018tis said, the name of Guyenne has its derivation; which would\nseem far fetched were there not as crude derivations in Plato himself.\n\nItem, \u2018tis a frivolous thing in itself, but nevertheless worthy to be\nrecorded for the strangeness of it, that is written by an eyewitness,\nthat Henry, Duke of Normandy, son of Henry II., king of England, making a\ngreat feast in France, the concourse of nobility and gentry was so great,\nthat being, for sport\u2019s sake, divided into troops, according to their\nnames, in the first troop, which consisted of Williams, there were found\nan hundred and ten knights sitting at the table of that name, without\nreckoning the ordinary gentlemen and servants.\n\nIt is as pleasant to distinguish the tables by the names of the guests as\nit was in the Emperor Geta to distinguish the several courses of his meat\nby the first letters of the meats themselves; so that those that began\nwith B were served up together, as brawn, beef, bream, bustards,\nbecca-ficos; and so of the others.  Item, there is a saying that it is a\ngood thing to have a good name, that is to say, credit and a good repute;\nbut besides this, it is really convenient to have a well-sounding name,\nsuch as is easy of pronunciation and easy to be remembered, by reason\nthat kings and other great persons do by that means the more easily know\nand the more hardly forget us; and indeed of our own servants we more\nfrequently call and employ those whose names are most ready upon the\ntongue.  I myself have seen Henry II., when he could not for his heart\nhit of a gentleman\u2019s name of our country of Gascony, and moreover was\nfain to call one of the queen\u2019s maids of honour by the general name of\nher race, her own family name being so difficult to pronounce or\nremember; and Socrates thinks it worthy a father\u2019s care to give fine\nnames to his children.\n\nItem, \u2018tis said that the foundation of Notre Dame la Grande at Poitiers\ntook its original from hence that a debauched young fellow formerly\nliving in that place, having got to him a wench, and, at her first coming\nin, asking her name, and being answered that it was Mary, he felt himself\nso suddenly pierced through with the awe of religion and the reverence to\nthat sacred name of the Blessed Virgin, that he not only immediately sent\nthe girl away, but became a reformed man and so continued the remainder\nof his life; and that, in consideration of this miracle, there was\nerected upon the place where this young man\u2019s house stood, first a chapel\ndedicated to our Lady and afterwards the church that we now see standing\nthere.  This vocal and auricular reproof wrought upon the conscience, and\nthat right into the soul; this that follows, insinuated itself merely by\nthe senses.  Pythagoras being in company with some wild young fellows,\nand perceiving that, heated with the feast, they comploted to go violate\nan honest house, commanded the singing wench to alter her wanton airs;\nand by a solemn, grave, and spondaic music, gently enchanted and laid\nasleep their ardour.\n\nItem, will not posterity say that our modern reformation has been\nwonderfully delicate and exact, in having not only combated errors and\nvices, and filled the world with devotion, humility, obedience, peace,\nand all sorts of virtue; but in having proceeded so far as to quarrel\nwith our ancient baptismal names of Charles, Louis, Francis, to fill the\nworld with Methuselahs, Ezekiels, and Malachis, names of a more spiritual\nsound?  A gentleman, a neighbour of mine, a great admirer of antiquity,\nand who was always extolling the excellences of former times in\ncomparison with this present age of ours, did not, amongst the rest,\nforget to dwell upon the lofty and magnificent sound of the gentleman\u2019s\nnames of those days, Don Grumedan, Quedregan, Agesilan, which, but to\nhear named he conceived to denote other kind of men than Pierre, Guillot,\nand Michel.\n\nItem, I am mightily pleased with Jacques Amyot for leaving, throughout a\nwhole French oration, the Latin names entire, without varying and\ngarbling them to give them a French cadence.  It seemed a little harsh\nand rough at first; but already custom, by the authority of his Plutarch,\nhas overcome that novelty.  I have often wished that such as write\nhistories in Latin would leave our names as they find them and as they\nare; for in making Vaudemont into Vallemontanus, and metamorphosing names\nto make them suit better with the Greek or Latin, we know not where we\nare, and with the persons of the men lose the benefit of the story.\n\nTo conclude, \u2018tis a scurvy custom and of very ill consequence that we\nhave in our kingdom of France to call every one by the name of his manor\nor seigneury; \u2018tis the thing in the world that the most prejudices and\nconfounds families and descents.  A younger brother of a good family,\nhaving a manor left him by his father, by the name of which he has been\nknown and honoured, cannot handsomely leave it; ten years after his\ndecease it falls into the hand of a stranger, who does the same: do but\njudge whereabouts we shall be concerning the knowledge of these men.  We\nneed look no further for examples than our own royal family, where every\npartition creates a new surname, whilst, in the meantime, the original of\nthe family is totally lost.  There is so great liberty taken in these\nmutations, that I have not in my time seen any one advanced by fortune to\nany extraordinary condition who has not presently had genealogical titles\nadded to him, new and unknown to his father, and who has not been\ninoculated into some illustrious stem by good luck; and the obscurest\nfamilies are the most apt for falsification.  How many gentlemen have we\nin France who by their own account are of royal extraction? more, I\nthink, than who will confess they are not.  Was it not a pleasant passage\nof a friend of mine?  There were, several gentlemen assembled together\nabout the dispute of one seigneur with another; which other had, in\ntruth, some preeminence of titles and alliances above the ordinary\ngentry.  Upon the debate of this prerogative, every one, to make himself\nequal to him, alleged, this one extraction, that another; this, the near\nresemblance of name, that, of arms; another, an old worm-eaten patent;\nthe very least of them was great-grandchild to some foreign king.  When\nthey came to sit down, to dinner, my friend, instead of taking his place\namongst them, retiring with most profound conges, entreated the company\nto excuse him for having hitherto lived with them at the saucy rate of a\ncompanion; but being now better informed of their quality, he would begin\nto pay them the respect due to their birth and grandeur, and that it\nwould ill become him to sit down among so many princes--ending this farce\nwith a thousand reproaches: \u201cLet us, in God\u2019s name, satisfy ourselves\nwith what our fathers were contented with, with what we are.  We are\ngreat enough, if we rightly understand how to maintain it.  Let us not\ndisown the fortune and condition of our ancestors, and let us lay aside\nthese ridiculous pretences, that can never be wanting to any one that has\nthe impudence to allege them.\u201d\n\nArms have no more security than surnames.  I bear azure powdered with\ntrefoils or, with a lion\u2019s paw of the same armed gules in fesse.  What\nprivilege has this to continue particularly in my house?  A son-in-law\nwill transport it into another family, or some paltry purchaser will make\nthem his first arms.  There is nothing wherein there is more change and\nconfusion.\n\nBut this consideration leads me, perforce, into another subject.  Let us\npry a little narrowly into, and, in God\u2019s name, examine upon what\nfoundation we erect this glory and reputation for which the world is\nturned topsy-turvy: wherein do we place this renown that we hunt after\nwith so much pains?  It is, in the end, Peter or William that carries it,\ntakes it into his possession, and whom it only concerns.  O what a\nvaliant faculty is hope, that in a mortal subject, and in a moment, makes\nnothing of usurping infinity, immensity, eternity, and of supplying its\nmaster\u2019s indigence, at its pleasure, with all things he can imagine or\ndesire!  Nature has given us this passion for a pretty toy to play\nwithal.  And this Peter or William, what is it but a sound, when all is\ndone? or three or four dashes with a pen, so easy to be varied that I\nwould fain know to whom is to be attributed the glory of so many\nvictories, to Guesquin, to Glesquin, or to Gueaquin?  and yet there would\nbe something of greater moment in the case than in Lucian, that Sigma\nshould serve Tau with a process; for\n\n                         \u201cNon levia aut ludicra petuntur\n                    Praemia;\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThey aim at no slight or jocular rewards.\u201d--AEneid, xii. 764.]\n\nthe chase is there in very good earnest: the question is, which of these\nletters is to be rewarded for so many sieges, battles, wounds,\nimprisonments, and services done to the crown of France by this famous\nconstable?  Nicholas Denisot--[Painter and poet, born at Le Mans,1515.]--\nnever concerned himself further than the letters of his name, of which he\nhas altered the whole contexture to build up by anagram the Count\nd\u2019Alsinois, whom he has handsomely endowed with the glory of his poetry\nand painting.  The historian Suetonius was satisfied with only the\nmeaning of his name, which made him cashier his father\u2019s surname, Lenis,\nto leave Tranquillus successor to the reputation of his writings.  Who\nwould believe that Captain Bayard should have no honour but what he\nderives from the deeds of Peter Terrail; and that Antonio Iscalin should\nsuffer himself to his face to be robbed of the honour of so many\nnavigations and commands at sea and land by Captain Paulin and the Baron\nde la Garde?  Secondly, these are dashes of the pen common to a thousand\npeople.  How many are there, in every family, of the same name and\nsurname? and how many more in several families, ages, and countries?\nHistory tells us of three of the name of Socrates, of five Platos, of\neight Aristotles, of seven Xenophons, of twenty Demetrii, and of twenty\nTheodores; and how many more she was not acquainted with we may imagine.\nWho hinders my groom from calling himself Pompey the Great?  But after\nall, what virtue, what authority, or what secret springs are there that\nfix upon my deceased groom, or the other Pompey, who had his head cut off\nin Egypt, this glorious renown, and these so much honoured flourishes of\nthe pen, so as to be of any advantage to them?\n\n          \u201cId cinerem et manes credis curare sepultos?\u201d\n\n     [\u201cDo you believe the dead regard such things?\u201d--AEneid, iv. 34.]\n\nWhat sense have the two companions in greatest esteem amongst me,\nEpaminondas, of this fine verse that has been so many ages current in his\npraise,\n\n          \u201cConsiliis nostris laus est attrita Laconum;\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThe glory of the Spartans is extinguished by my plans.\n     --\u201cCicero, Tusc. Quaes., v. 17.]\n\nor Africanus, of this other,\n\n          \u201cA sole exoriente supra Maeotis Paludes\n          Nemo est qui factis me aequiparare queat.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cFrom where the sun rises over the Palus Maeotis, to where it sets,\n     there is no one whose acts can compare with mine\u201d--Idem, ibid.]\n\nSurvivors indeed tickle themselves with these fine phrases, and by them\nincited to jealousy and desire, inconsiderately and according to their\nown fancy, attribute to the dead this their own feeling, vainly\nflattering themselves that they shall one day in turn be capable of the\nsame character.  However:\n\n                              \u201cAd haec se\n          Romanus Graiusque, et Barbaras induperator\n          Erexit; caucus discriminis atque laboris\n          Inde habuit: tanto major famae sitis est, quam\n          Virtutis.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cFor these the Roman, the Greek, and the Barbarian commander hath\n     aroused himself; he has incurred thence causes of danger and toil:\n     so much greater is the thirst for fame than for virtue.\u201d\n      --Juvenal, x. 137.]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLVII\n\nOF THE UNCERTAINTY OF OUR JUDGMENT\n\nWell says this verse:\n\n     [\u201cThere is everywhere much liberty of speech.\u201d--Iliad, xx.  249.]\n\nFor example:\n\n     [\u201cHannibal conquered, but knew not how to make the best use of his\n     victorious venture.\u201d--Petrarch, Son., 83.]\n\nSuch as would improve this argument, and condemn the oversight of our\nleaders in not pushing home the victory at Moncontour, or accuse the King\nof Spain of not knowing how to make the best use of the advantage he had\nagainst us at St. Quentin, may conclude these oversights to proceed from\na soul already drunk with success, or from a spirit which, being full and\novergorged with this beginning of good fortune, had lost the appetite of\nadding to it, already having enough to do to digest what it had taken in:\nhe has his arms full, and can embrace no more: unworthy of the benefit\nfortune has conferred upon him and the advantage she had put into his\nhands: for what utility does he reap from it, if, notwithstanding, he\ngive his enemy respite to rally and make head against him?  What hope is\nthere that he will dare at another time to attack an enemy reunited and\nrecomposed, and armed anew with anger and revenge, who did not dare to\npursue them when routed and unmanned by fear?\n\n          \u201cDum fortuna calet, dum conficit omnia terror.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cWhilst fortune is fresh, and terror finishes all.\u201d\n      --Lucan, vii. 734.]\n\nBut withal, what better opportunity can he expect than that he has lost?\n\u2018Tis not here, as in fencing, where the most hits gain the prize; for so\nlong as the enemy is on foot, the game is new to begin, and that is not\nto be called a victory that puts not an end to the war.  In the encounter\nwhere Caesar had the worst, near the city of Oricum, he reproached\nPompey\u2019s soldiers that he had been lost had their general known how to\novercome; and afterwards clawed him in a very different fashion when it\ncame to his turn.\n\nBut why may not a man also argue, on the contrary, that it is the effect\nof a precipitous and insatiate spirit not to know how to bound and\nrestrain its coveting; that it is to abuse the favours of God to exceed\nthe measure He has prescribed them: and that again to throw a man\u2019s self\ninto danger after a victory obtained is again to expose himself to the\nmercy of fortune: that it is one of the greatest discretions in the rule\nof war not to drive an enemy to despair?  Sylla and Marius in the social\nwar, having defeated the Marsians, seeing yet a body of reserve that,\nprompted by despair, was coming on like enraged brutes to dash in upon\nthem, thought it not convenient to stand their charge.  Had not Monsieur\nde Foix\u2019s ardour transported him so furiously to pursue the remains of\nthe victory of Ravenna, he had not obscured it by his own death.  And yet\nthe recent memory of his example served to preserve Monsieur d\u2019Anguien\nfrom the same misfortune at the battle of Serisoles.  \u2018Tis dangerous to\nattack a man you have deprived of all means to escape but by his arms,\nfor necessity teaches violent resolutions:\n\n          \u201cGravissimi sunt morsus irritatae necessitatis.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cIrritated necessity bites deepest.\u201d--Portius Latro., Declam.]\n\n          \u201cVincitur haud gratis, jugulo qui provocat hostem.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cHe is not readily beaten who provokes the enemy by shewing\n     his throat.\u201d--or: \u201cHe who presents himself to his foe, sells his\n     life dear.\u201d--Lucan, iv. 275.]\n\nThis was it that made Pharax withhold the King of Lacedaemon, who had won\na battle against the Mantineans, from going to charge a thousand Argians,\nwho had escaped in an entire body from the defeat, but rather let them\nsteal off at liberty that he might not encounter valour whetted and\nenraged by mischance.  Clodomir, king of Aquitaine, after his victory\npursuing Gondemar, king of Burgundy, beaten and making off as fast as he\ncould for safety, compelled him to face about and make head, wherein his\nobstinacy deprived him of the fruit of his conquest, for he there lost\nhis life.\n\nIn like manner, if a man were to choose whether he would have his\nsoldiers richly and sumptuously accoutred or armed only for the necessity\nof the matter in hand, this argument would step in to favour the first,\nof which opinion was Sertorius, Philopcemen, Brutus, Caesar, and others,\nthat it is to a soldier an enflaming of courage and a spur himself in\nbrave attire; and withal a motive to be more obstinate in fight, having\nhis arms, which are in a manner his estate and whole inheritance to\ndefend; which is the reason, says Xenophon, why those of Asia carried\ntheir wives and concubines, with their choicest jewels and greatest\nwealth, along with them to the wars.  But then these arguments would be\nas ready to stand up for the other side; that a general ought rather to\nlessen in his men their solicitude of preserving themselves than to\nincrease it; that by such means they will be in a double fear of\nhazarding their persons, as it will be a double temptation to the enemy\nto fight with greater resolution where so great booty and so rich spoils\nare to be obtained; and this very thing has been observed in former\ntimes, notably to encourage the Romans against the Samnites.  Antiochus,\nshewing Hannibal the army he had raised, wonderfully splendid and rich in\nall sorts of equipage, asked him if the Romans would be satisfied with\nthat army?  \u201cSatisfied,\u201d replied the other, \u201cyes, doubtless, were their\navarice never so great.\u201d  Lycurgus not only forbad his soldiers all\nmanner of bravery in their equipage, but, moreover, to strip their\nconquered enemies, because he would, as he said, that poverty and\nfrugality should shine with the rest of the battle.\n\nAt sieges and elsewhere, where occasion draws us near to the enemy, we\nwillingly suffer our men to brave, rate, and affront him with all sorts\nof injurious language; and not without some colour of reason: for it is\nof no little consequence to take from them all hopes of mercy and\ncomposition, by representing to them that there is no fair quarter to be\nexpected from an enemy they have incensed to that degree, nor other\nremedy remaining but in victory.  And yet Vitellius found himself\ndeceived in this way of proceeding; for having to do with Otho, weaker in\nthe valour of his soldiers, long unaccustomed to war and effeminated with\nthe delights of the city, he so nettled them at last with injurious\nlanguage, reproaching them with cowardice and regret for the mistresses\nand entertainments they had left behind at Rome, that by this means he\ninspired them with such resolution as no exhortation had had the power to\nhave done, and himself made them fall upon him, with whom their own\ncaptains before could by no means prevail.  And, indeed, when they are\ninjuries that touch to the quick, it may very well fall out that he who\nwent but unwillingly to work in the behalf of his prince will fall to\u2019t\nwith another sort of mettle when the quarrel is his own.\n\nConsidering of how great importance is the preservation of the general of\nan army, and that the universal aim of an enemy is levelled directly at\nthe head, upon which all the others depend, the course seems to admit of\nno dispute, which we know has been taken by so many great captains, of\nchanging their habit and disguising their persons upon the point of going\nto engage.  Nevertheless, the inconvenience a man by so doing runs into\nis not less than that he thinks to avoid; for the captain, by this means\nbeing concealed from the knowledge of his own men, the courage they\nshould derive from his presence and example happens by degrees to cool\nand to decay; and not seeing the wonted marks and ensigns of their\nleader, they presently conclude him either dead, or that, despairing of\nthe business, he is gone to shift for himself.  And experience shows us\nthat both these ways have been successful and otherwise.  What befell\nPyrrhus in the battle he fought against the Consul Levinus in Italy will\nserve us to both purposes; for though by shrouding his person under the\narmour of Megacles and making him wear his own, he undoubtedly preserved\nhis own life, yet, by that very means, he was withal very near running\ninto the other mischief of losing the battle.  Alexander, Caesar, and\nLucullus loved to make themselves known in a battle by rich accoutrements\nand armour of a particular lustre and colour: Agis, Agesilaus, and that\ngreat Gilippus, on the contrary, used to fight obscurely armed, and\nwithout any imperial attendance or distinction.\n\nAmongst other oversights Pompey is charged withal at the battle of\nPharsalia, he is condemned for making his army stand still to receive the\nenemy\u2019s charge; by \u201creason that\u201d (I shall here steal Plutarch\u2019s own\nwords, which are better than mine) \u201che by so doing deprived himself of\nthe violent impression the motion of running adds to the first shock of\narms, and hindered that clashing of the combatants against one another\nwhich is wont to give them greater impetuosity and fury; especially when\nthey come to rush in with their utmost vigour, their courages increasing\nby the shouts and the career; \u2018tis to render the soldiers\u2019 ardour, as a\nman may say, more reserved and cold.\u201d  This is what he says.  But if\nCaesar had come by the worse, why might it not as well have been urged by\nanother, that, on the contrary, the strongest and most steady posture of\nfighting is that wherein a man stands planted firm without motion; and\nthat they who are steady upon the march, closing up, and reserving their\nforce within themselves for the push of the business, have a great\nadvantage against those who are disordered, and who have already spent\nhalf their breath in running on precipitately to the charge?  Besides\nthat an army is a body made up of so many individual members, it is\nimpossible for it to move in this fury with so exact a motion as not to\nbreak the order of battle, and that the best of them are not engaged\nbefore their fellows can come on to help them.  In that unnatural battle\nbetwixt the two Persian brothers, the Lacedaemonian Clearchus, who\ncommanded the Greeks of Cyrus\u2019 party, led them on softly and without\nprecipitation to the charge; but, coming within fifty paces, hurried them\non full speed, hoping in so short a career both to keep their order and\nto husband their breath, and at the same time to give the advantage of\nimpetuosity and impression both to their persons and their missile arms.\nOthers have regulated this question as to their armies thus if your enemy\ncome full drive upon you, stand firm to receive him; if he stand to\nreceive you, run full drive upon him.\n\nIn the expedition of the Emperor Charles V. into Provence, King Francis\nwas put to choose either to go meet him in Italy or to await him in his\nown dominions; wherein, though he very well considered of how great\nadvantage it was to preserve his own territory entire and clear from the\ntroubles of war, to the end that, being unexhausted of its stores, it\nmight continually supply men and money at need; that the necessity of war\nrequires at every turn to spoil and lay waste the country before us,\nwhich cannot very well be done upon one\u2019s own; to which may be added,\nthat the country people do not so easily digest such a havoc by those of\ntheir own party as from an enemy, so that seditions and commotions might\nby such means be kindled amongst us; that the licence of pillage and\nplunder (which are not to be tolerated at home) is a great ease and\nrefreshment against the fatigues and sufferings of war; and that he who\nhas no other prospect of gain than his bare pay will hardly be kept from\nrunning home, being but two steps from his wife and his own house; that\nhe who lays the cloth is ever at the charge of the feast; that there is\nmore alacrity in assaulting than defending; and that the shock of a\nbattle\u2019s loss in our own bowels is so violent as to endanger the\ndisjointing of the whole body, there being no passion so contagious as\nthat of fear, that is so easily believed, or that so suddenly diffuses\nitself; and that the cities that should hear the rattle of this tempest\nat their gates, that should take in their captains and soldiers yet\ntrembling and out of breath, would be in danger in this heat and hurry to\nprecipitate themselves upon some untoward resolution: notwithstanding all\nthis, so it was that he chose to recall the forces he had beyond the\nmountains and to suffer the enemy to come to him.  For he might, on the\nother hand, imagine that, being at home and amongst his friends, he could\nnot fail of plenty of all manner of conveniences; the rivers and passes\nhe had at his devotion would bring him in both provisions and money in\nall security, and without the trouble of convoy; that he should find his\nsubjects by so much the more affectionate to him, by how much their\ndanger was more near and pressing; that having so many cities and\nbarriers to secure him, it would be in his power to give the law of\nbattle at his own opportunity and advantage; and that, if it pleased him\nto delay the time, under cover and at his ease he might see his enemy\nfounder and defeat himself with the difficulties he was certain to\nencounter, being engaged in a hostile country, where before, behind, and\non every side war would be made upon him; no means to refresh himself or\nto enlarge his quarters, should diseases infest them, or to lodge his\nwounded men in safety; no money, no victuals, but at the point of the\nlance; no leisure to repose and take breath; no knowledge of the ways or\ncountry to secure him from ambushes and surprises; and in case of losing\na battle, no possible means of saving the remains.  Neither is there want\nof example in both these cases.\n\nScipio thought it much better to go and attack his enemy\u2019s territories in\nAfrica than to stay at home to defend his own and to fight him in Italy,\nand it succeeded well with him.  But, on the contrary, Hannibal in the\nsame war ruined himself by abandoning the conquest of a foreign country\nto go and defend his own.  The Athenians having left the enemy in their\nown dominions to go over into Sicily, were not favoured by fortune in\ntheir design; but Agathocles, king of Syracuse, found her favourable to\nhim when he went over into Africa and left the war at home.\n\nBy which examples we are wont to conclude, and with some reason, that\nevents, especially in war, for the most part depend upon fortune, who\nwill not be governed by nor submit unto human reasons and prudence,\naccording to the poet:\n\n         \u201cEt male consultis pretium est: prudentia fallit\n          Nec fortune probat causas, sequiturque merentes,\n          Sed vaga per cunctos nullo discrimine fertur.\n          Scilicet est aliud, quod nos cogatque regatque\n          Majus, et in proprias ducat mortalia leges.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cAnd there is value in ill counsel: prudence deceives: nor does\n     fortune inquire into causes, nor aid the most deserving, but turns\n     hither and thither without discrimination.

I\nthink I have read that the Romans had a sort of horses by them called\n\u2018funales\u2019 or \u2018dextrarios\u2019, which were either led horses, or horses laid\non at several stages to be taken fresh upon occasion, and thence it is\nthat we call our horses of service \u2018destriers\u2019; and our romances commonly\nuse the phrase of \u2018adestrer\u2019 for \u2018accompagner\u2019, to accompany.  They also\ncalled those that were trained in such sort, that running full speed,\nside by side, without bridle or saddle, the Roman gentlemen, armed at all\npieces, would shift and throw themselves from one to the other,\n\u2018desultorios equos\u2019.  The Numidian men-at-arms had always a led horse in\none hand, besides that they rode upon, to change in the heat of battle:\n\n    \u201cQuibus, desultorum in modum, binos trahentibus equos, inter\n     acerrimam saepe pugnam, in recentem equum, ex fesso, armatis\n     transultare mos erat: tanta velocitas ipsis, tamque docile\n     equorum genus.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cTo whom it was a custom, leading along two horses, often in the\n     hottest fight, to leap armed from a tired horse to a fresh one; so\n     active were the men, and the horses so docile.\u201d--Livy, xxiii. 29.]\n\nThere are many horses trained to help their riders so as to run upon any\none, that appears with a drawn sword, to fall both with mouth and heels\nupon any that front or oppose them: but it often happens that they do\nmore harm to their friends than to their enemies; and, moreover, you\ncannot loose them from their hold, to reduce them again into order, when\nthey are once engaged and grappled, by which means you remain at the\nmercy of their quarrel.  It happened very ill to Artybius, general of the\nPersian army, fighting, man to man, with Onesilus, king of Salamis, to be\nmounted upon a horse trained after this manner, it being the occasion of\nhis death, the squire of Onesilus cleaving the horse down with a scythe\nbetwixt the shoulders as it was reared up upon his master.  And what the\nItalians report, that in the battle of Fornova, the horse of Charles\nVIII., with kicks and plunges, disengaged his master from the enemy that\npressed upon him, without which he had been slain, sounds like a very\ngreat chance, if it be true.\n\n     [In the narrative which Philip de Commines has given of this battle,\n     in which he himself was present (lib. viii.  ch. 6), he tells us\n     of wonderful performances by the horse on which the king was\n     mounted.  The name of the horse was Savoy, and it was the most\n     beautiful horse he had ever seen.  During the battle the king was\n     personally attacked, when he had nobody near him but a valet de\n     chambre, a little fellow, and not well armed.  \u201cThe king,\u201d says\n     Commines, \u201chad the best horse under him in the world, and therefore\n     he stood his ground bravely, till a number of his men, not a great\n     way from him, arrived at the critical minute.\u201d]\n\nThe Mamalukes make their boast that they have the most ready horses of\nany cavalry in the world; that by nature and custom they were taught to\nknow and distinguish the enemy, and to fall foul upon them with mouth and\nheels, according to a word or sign given; as also to gather up with their\nteeth darts and lances scattered upon the field, and present them to\ntheir riders, on the word of command.  \u2018T is said, both of Caesar and\nPompey, that amongst their other excellent qualities they were both very\ngood horsemen, and particularly of Caesar, that in his youth, being\nmounted on the bare back, without saddle or bridle, he could make the\nhorse run, stop, and turn, and perform all its airs, with his hands\nbehind him.  As nature designed to make of this person, and of Alexander,\ntwo miracles of military art, so one would say she had done her utmost to\narm them after an extraordinary manner for every one knows that\nAlexander\u2019s horse, Bucephalus, had a head inclining to the shape of a\nbull; that he would suffer himself to be mounted and governed by none but\nhis master, and that he was so honoured after his death as to have a city\nerected to his name.  Caesar had also one which had forefeet like those\nof a man, his hoofs being divided in the form of fingers, which likewise\nwas not to be ridden, by any but Caesar himself, who, after his death,\ndedicated his statue to the goddess Venus.\n\nI do not willingly alight when I am once on horseback, for it is the\nplace where, whether well or sick, I find myself most at ease.  Plato\nrecommends it for health, as also Pliny says it is good for the stomach\nand the joints.  Let us go further into this matter since here we are.\n\nWe read in Xenophon a law forbidding any one who was master of a horse to\ntravel on foot.  Trogus Pompeius and Justin say that the Parthians were\nwont to perform all offices and ceremonies, not only in war but also all\naffairs whether public or private, make bargains, confer, entertain, take\nthe air, and all on horseback; and that the greatest distinction betwixt\nfreemen and slaves amongst them was that the one rode on horseback and\nthe other went on foot, an institution of which King Cyrus was the\nfounder.\n\nThere are several examples in the Roman history (and Suetonius more\nparticularly observes it of Caesar) of captains who, on pressing\noccasions, commanded their cavalry to alight, both by that means to take\nfrom them all hopes of flight, as also for the advantage they hoped in\nthis sort of fight.\n\n               \u201cQuo baud dubie superat Romanus,\u201d\n\n     [\u201cWherein the Roman does questionless excel.\u201d--Livy, ix. 22.]\n\nsays Livy.  And so the first thing they did to prevent the mutinies and\ninsurrections of nations of late conquest was to take from them their\narms and horses, and therefore it is that we so often meet in Caesar:\n\n          \u201cArma proferri, jumenta produci, obsides dari jubet.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cHe commanded the arms to be produced, the horses brought out,\n     hostages to be given.\u201d--De Bello Gall., vii. II.]\n\nThe Grand Signior to this day suffers not a Christian or a Jew to keep a\nhorse of his own throughout his empire.\n\nOur ancestors, and especially at the time they had war with the English,\nin all their greatest engagements and pitched battles fought for the most\npart on foot, that they might have nothing but their own force, courage,\nand constancy to trust to in a quarrel of so great concern as life and\nhonour.  You stake (whatever Chrysanthes in Xenophon says to the\ncontrary) your valour and your fortune upon that of your horse; his\nwounds or death bring your person into the same danger; his fear or fury\nshall make you reputed rash or cowardly; if he have an ill mouth or will\nnot answer to the spur, your honour must answer for it.  And, therefore,\nI do not think it strange that those battles were more firm and furious\nthan those that are fought on horseback:\n\n               \u201cCaedebant pariter, pariterque ruebant\n          Victores victique; neque his fuga nota, neque illis.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThey fought and fell pell-mell, victors and vanquished; nor was\n     flight thought of by either.\u201d--AEneid, x. 756.]\n\nTheir battles were much better disputed.  Nowadays there are nothing but\nrouts:\n\n          \u201cPrimus clamor atque impetus rem decernit.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThe first shout and charge decides the business.\u201d--Livy, xxv. 41.]\n\nAnd the means we choose to make use of in so great a hazard should be as\nmuch as possible at our own command: wherefore I should advise to choose\nweapons of the shortest sort, and such of which we are able to give the\nbest account.  A man may repose more confidence in a sword he holds in\nhis hand than in a bullet he discharges out of a pistol, wherein there\nmust be a concurrence of several circumstances to make it perform its\noffice, the powder, the stone, and the wheel: if any of which fail it\nendangers your fortune.  A man himself strikes much surer than the air\ncan direct his blow:\n\n          \u201cEt, quo ferre velint, permittere vulnera ventis\n          Ensis habet vires; et gens quaecumque virorum est,\n          Bella gerit gladiis.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cAnd so where they choose to carry [the arrows], the winds allow\n     the wounds; the sword has strength of arm: and whatever nation of\n     men there is, they wage war with swords.\u201d--Lucan, viii. 384.]\n\nBut of that weapon I shall speak more fully when I come to compare the\narms of the ancients with those of modern use; only, by the way, the\nastonishment of the ear abated, which every one grows familiar with in a\nshort time, I look upon it as a weapon of very little execution, and hope\nwe shall one day lay it aside.  That missile weapon which the Italians\nformerly made use of both with fire and by sling was much more terrible:\nthey called a certain kind of javelin, armed at the point with an iron\nthree feet long, that it might pierce through and through an armed man,\nPhalarica, which they sometimes in the field darted by hand, sometimes\nfrom several sorts of engines for the defence of beleaguered places; the\nshaft being rolled round with flax, wax, rosin, oil, and other\ncombustible matter, took fire in its flight, and lighting upon the body\nof a man or his target, took away all the use of arms and limbs.  And\nyet, coming to close fight, I should think they would also damage the\nassailant, and that the camp being as it were planted with these flaming\ntruncheons, would produce a common inconvenience to the whole crowd:\n\n          \u201cMagnum stridens contorta Phalarica venit,\n          Fulminis acta modo.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThe Phalarica, launched like lightning, flies through\n     the air with a loud rushing sound.\u201d--AEneid, ix. 705.]\n\nThey had, moreover, other devices which custom made them perfect in\n(which seem incredible to us who have not seen them), by which they\nsupplied the effects of our powder and shot.  They darted their spears\nwith so great force, as ofttimes to transfix two targets and two armed\nmen at once, and pin them together.  Neither was the effect of their\nslings less certain of execution or of shorter carriage:\n\n     [\u201cCulling round stones from the beach for their slings; and with\n     these practising over the waves, so as from a great distance to\n     throw within a very small circuit, they became able not only to\n     wound an enemy in the head, but hit any other part at pleasure.\u201d\n      --Livy, xxxviii. 29.]\n\nTheir pieces of battery had not only the execution but the thunder of our\ncannon also:\n\n          \u201cAd ictus moenium cum terribili sonitu editos,\n          pavor et trepidatio cepit.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cAt the battery of the walls, performed with a terrible noise,\n     the defenders began to fear and tremble.\u201d--Idem, ibid., 5.]\n\nThe Gauls, our kinsmen in Asia, abominated these treacherous missile\narms, it being their use to fight, with greater bravery, hand to hand:\n\n     [\u201cThey are not so much concerned about large gashes-the bigger and\n     deeper the wound, the more glorious do they esteem the combat but\n     when they find themselves tormented by some arrow-head or bullet\n     lodged within, but presenting little outward show of wound,\n     transported with shame and anger to perish by so imperceptible a\n     destroyer, they fall to the ground.\u201d---Livy, xxxviii.  21.]\n\nA pretty description of something very like an arquebuse-shot.  The ten\nthousand Greeks in their long and famous retreat met with a nation who\nvery much galled them with great and strong bows, carrying arrows so long\nthat, taking them up, one might return them back like a dart, and with\nthem pierce a buckler and an armed man through and through.  The engines,\nthat Dionysius invented at Syracuse to shoot vast massy darts and stones\nof a prodigious greatness with so great impetuosity and at so great a\ndistance, came very near to our modern inventions.\n\nBut in this discourse of horses and horsemanship, we are not to forget\nthe pleasant posture of one Maistre Pierre Pol, a doctor of divinity,\nupon his mule, whom Monstrelet reports always to have ridden sideways\nthrough the streets of Paris like a woman.  He says also, elsewhere, that\nthe Gascons had terrible horses, that would wheel in their full speed,\nwhich the French, Picards, Flemings, and Brabanters looked upon as a\nmiracle, \u201chaving never seen the like before,\u201d which are his very words.\n\nCaesar, speaking of the Suabians: \u201cin the charges they make on\nhorseback,\u201d says he, \u201cthey often throw themselves off to fight on foot,\nhaving taught their horses not to stir in the meantime from the place,\nto which they presently run again upon occasion; and according to their\ncustom, nothing is so unmanly and so base as to use saddles or pads, and\nthey despise such as make use of those conveniences: insomuch that, being\nbut a very few in number, they fear not to attack a great many.\u201d  That\nwhich I have formerly wondered at, to see a horse made to perform all his\nairs with a switch only and the reins upon his neck, was common with the\nMassilians, who rid their horses without saddle or bridle:\n\n          \u201cEt gens, quae nudo residens Massylia dorso,\n          Ora levi flectit, fraenorum nescia, virga.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThe Massylians, mounted on the bare backs of their horses,\n     bridleless, guide them by a mere switch.\u201d--Lucan, iv.  682.]\n\n               \u201cEt Numidae infraeni cingunt.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThe Numidians guiding their horses without bridles.\u201d\n      --AEneid, iv.  41.]\n\n          \u201cEqui sine fraenis, deformis ipse cursus,\n          rigida cervice et extento capite currentium.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThe career of a horse without a bridle is ungraceful; the neck\n     extended stiff, and the nose thrust out.\u201d--Livy, xxxv. II.]\n\nKing Alfonso,--[Alfonso XI., king of Leon and Castile, died 1350.]--\nhe who first instituted the Order of the Band or Scarf in Spain, amongst\nother rules of the order, gave them this, that they should never ride\nmule or mulet, upon penalty of a mark of silver; this I had lately out of\nGuevara\u2019s Letters.  Whoever gave these the title of Golden Epistles had\nanother kind of opinion of them than I have.  The Courtier says, that\ntill his time it was a disgrace to a gentleman to ride on one of these\ncreatures: but the Abyssinians, on the contrary, the nearer they are to\nthe person of Prester John, love to be mounted upon large mules, for the\ngreatest dignity and grandeur.\n\nXenophon tells us, that the Assyrians were fain to keep their horses\nfettered in the stable, they were so fierce and vicious; and that it\nrequired so much time to loose and harness them, that to avoid any\ndisorder this tedious preparation might bring upon them in case of\nsurprise, they never sat down in their camp till it was first well\nfortified with ditches and ramparts.  His Cyrus, who was so great a\nmaster in all manner of horse service, kept his horses to their due work,\nand never suffered them to have anything to eat till first they had\nearned it by the sweat of some kind of exercise.  The Scythians when in\nthe field and in scarcity of provisions used to let their horses blood,\nwhich they drank, and sustained themselves by that diet:\n\n               \u201cVenit et epoto Sarmata pastus equo.\u201d\n\n          [\u201cThe Scythian comes, who feeds on horse-flesh\u201d\n           --Martial, De Spectaculis Libey, Epigr. iii. 4.]\n\nThose of Crete, being besieged by Metellus, were in so great necessity\nfor drink that they were fain to quench their thirst with their horses\nurine.--[Val.  Max., vii. 6, ext. 1.]\n\nTo shew how much cheaper the Turkish armies support themselves than our\nEuropean forces, \u2018tis said that besides the soldiers drink nothing but\nwater and eat nothing but rice and salt flesh pulverised (of which every\none may easily carry about with him a month\u2019s provision), they know how\nto feed upon the blood of their horses as well as the Muscovite and\nTartar, and salt it for their use.\n\nThese new-discovered people of the Indies [Mexico and Yucatan  D.W.],\nwhen the Spaniards first landed amongst them, had so great an opinion\nboth of the men and horses, that they looked upon the first as gods and\nthe other as animals ennobled above their nature; insomuch that after\nthey were subdued, coming to the men to sue for peace and pardon, and to\nbring them gold and provisions, they failed not to offer of the same to\nthe horses, with the same kind of harangue to them they had made to the\nothers: interpreting their neighing for a language of truce and\nfriendship.\n\nIn the other Indies, to ride upon an elephant was the first and royal\nplace of honour; the second to ride in a coach with four horses; the\nthird to ride upon a camel; and the last and least honour to be carried\nor drawn by one horse only.  Some one of our late writers tells us that\nhe has been in countries in those parts where they ride upon oxen with\npads, stirrups, and bridles, and very much at their ease.\n\nQuintus Fabius Maximus Rullianus, in a battle with the Samnites, seeing\nhis horse, after three or four charges, had failed of breaking into the\nenemy\u2019s battalion, took this course, to make them unbridle all their\nhorses and spur their hardest, so that having nothing to check their\ncareer, they might through weapons and men open the way to his foot, who\nby that means gave them a bloody defeat.  The same command was given by\nQuintus Fulvius Flaccus against the Celtiberians:\n\n     [\u201cYou will do your business with greater advantage of your horses\u2019\n     strength, if you send them unbridled upon the enemy, as it is\n     recorded the Roman horse to their great glory have often done; their\n     bits being taken off, they charged through and again back through\n     the enemy\u2019s ranks with great slaughter, breaking down all their\n     spears.\u201d--Idem, xl. 40.]\n\nThe Duke of Muscovy was anciently obliged to pay this reverence to the\nTartars, that when they sent an embassy to him he went out to meet them\non foot, and presented them with a goblet of mares\u2019 milk (a beverage of\ngreatest esteem amongst them), and if, in drinking, a drop fell by chance\nupon their horse\u2019s mane, he was bound to lick it off with his tongue.\nThe army that Bajazet had sent into Russia was overwhelmed with so\ndreadful a tempest of snow, that to shelter and preserve themselves from\nthe cold, many killed and embowelled their horses, to creep into their\nbellies and enjoy the benefit of that vital heat.  Bajazet, after that\nfurious battle wherein he was overthrown by Tamerlane,  was in a hopeful\nway of securing his own person by the fleetness of an Arabian mare he had\nunder him, had he not been constrained to let her drink her fill at the\nford of a river in his way, which rendered her so heavy and indisposed,\nthat he was afterwards easily overtaken by those that pursued him.  They\nsay, indeed, that to let a horse stale takes him off his mettle, but as\nto drinking, I should rather have thought it would refresh him.\n\nCroesus, marching his army through certain waste lands near Sardis, met\nwith an infinite number of serpents, which the horses devoured with great\nappetite, and which Herodotus says was a prodigy of ominous portent to\nhis affairs.\n\nWe call a horse entire, that has his mane and ears so, and no other will\npass muster.  The Lacedaemonians, having defeated the Athenians in\nSicily, returning triumphant from the victory into the city of Syracuse,\namongst other insolences, caused all the horses they had taken to be\nshorn and led in triumph.  Alexander fought with a nation called Dahas,\nwhose discipline it was to march two and two together armed on one horse,\nto the war; and being in fight, one of them alighted, and so they fought\non horseback and on foot, one after another by turns.\n\nI do not think that for graceful riding any nation in the world excels\nthe French.  A good horseman, according to our way of speaking, seems\nrather to have respect to the courage of the man than address in riding.\nOf all that ever I saw, the most knowing in that art, who had the best\nseat and the best method in breaking horses, was Monsieur de Carnavalet,\nwho served our King Henry II.\n\nI have seen a man ride with both his feet upon the saddle, take off his\nsaddle, and at his return take it up again and replace it, riding all the\nwhile full speed; having galloped over a cap, make at it very good shots\nbackwards with his bow; take up anything from the ground, setting one\nfoot on the ground and the other in the stirrup: with twenty other ape\u2019s\ntricks, which he got his living by.\n\nThere has been seen in my time at Constantinople two men upon one horse,\nwho, in the height of its speed, would throw themselves off and into the\nsaddle again by turn; and one who bridled and saddled his horse with\nnothing but his teeth; an other who betwixt two horses, one foot upon one\nsaddle and the other upon another, carrying the other man upon his\nshoulders, would ride full career, the other standing bolt upright upon\nand making very good shots with his bow; several who would ride full\nspeed with their heels upward, and their heads upon the saddle betwixt\nseveral scimitars, with the points upwards, fixed in the harness.  When I\nwas a boy, the prince of Sulmona, riding an unbroken horse at Naples,\nprone to all sorts of action, held reals--[A small coin of Spain, the\nTwo Sicilies, &c.]--under his knees and toes, as if they had been nailed\nthere, to shew the firmness of his seat.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XLIX\n\nOF ANCIENT CUSTOMS\n\nI should willingly pardon our people for admitting no other pattern or\nrule of perfection than their own peculiar manners and customs; for \u2018tis\na common vice, not of the vulgar only, but almost of all men, to walk in\nthe beaten road their ancestors have trod before them.  I am content,\nwhen they see Fabricius or Laelius, that they look upon their countenance\nand behaviour as barbarous, seeing they are neither clothed nor fashioned\naccording to our mode.  But I find fault with their singular indiscretion\nin suffering themselves to be so blinded and imposed upon by the\nauthority of the present usage as every month to alter their opinion, if\ncustom so require, and that they should so vary their judgment in their\nown particular concern.  When they wore the busk of their doublets up as\nhigh as their breasts, they stiffly maintained that they were in their\nproper place; some years after it was slipped down betwixt their thighs,\nand then they could laugh at the former fashion as uneasy and\nintolerable.  The fashion now in use makes them absolutely condemn the\nother two with so great resolution and so universal consent, that a man\nwould think there was a certain kind of madness crept in amongst them,\nthat infatuates their understandings to this strange degree.  Now, seeing\nthat our change of fashions is so prompt and sudden, that the inventions\nof all the tailors in the world cannot furnish out new whim-whams enow to\nfeed our vanity withal, there will often be a necessity that the despised\nforms must again come in vogue, these immediately after fall into the\nsame contempt; and that the same judgment must, in the space of fifteen\nor twenty years, take up half-a-dozen not only divers but contrary\nopinions, with an incredible lightness and inconstancy; there is not any\nof us so discreet, who suffers not himself to be gulled with this\ncontradiction, and both in external and internal sight to be insensibly\nblinded.\n\nI wish to muster up here some old customs that I have in memory, some of\nthem the same with ours, the others different, to the end that, bearing\nin mind this continual variation of human things, we may have our\njudgment more clearly and firmly settled.\n\nThe thing in use amongst us of fighting with rapier and cloak was in\npractice amongst the Romans also:\n\n          \u201cSinistras sagis involvunt, gladiosque distringunt,\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThey wrapt their cloaks upon the left arm, and drew their\n     swords.\u201d--De Bello Civili, i. 75.]\n\nsays Caesar; and he observes a vicious custom of our nation, that\ncontinues yet amongst us, which is to stop passengers we meet upon the\nroad, to compel them to give an account who they are, and to take it for\nan affront and just cause of quarrel if they refuse to do it.\n\nAt the Baths, which the ancients made use of every day before they went\nto dinner, and as frequently as we wash our hands, they at first only\nbathed their arms and legs; but afterwards, and by a custom that has\ncontinued for many ages in most nations of the world, they bathed stark\nnaked in mixed and perfumed water, looking upon it as a great simplicity\nto bathe in mere water.  The most delicate and affected perfumed\nthemselves all over three or four times a day.  They often caused their\nhair to be pinched off, as the women of France have some time since taken\nup a custom to do their foreheads,\n\n          \u201cQuod pectus, quod crura tibi, quod brachia veilis,\u201d\n\n     [\u201cYou pluck the hairs out of your breast, your arms, and thighs.\u201d\n      --Martial, ii.  62, i.]\n\nthough they had ointments proper for that purpose:\n\n          \u201cPsilotro nitet, aut acids latet oblita creta.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cShe shines with unguents, or with chalk dissolved in vinegar.\u201d\n      --Idem, vi.  93, 9.]\n\nThey delighted to lie soft, and alleged it as a great testimony of\nhardiness to lie upon a mattress.  They ate lying upon beds, much after\nthe manner of the Turks in this age:\n\n          \u201cInde thoro pater AEneas sic orsus ab alto.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThus Father AEneas, from his high bed of state, spoke.\u201d\n      --AEneid, ii. 2.]\n\nAnd \u2018tis said of the younger Cato, that after the battle of Pharsalia,\nbeing entered into a melancholy disposition at the ill posture of the\npublic affairs, he took his repasts always sitting, assuming a strict and\naustere course of life.  It was also their custom to kiss the hands of\ngreat persons; the more to honour and caress them.  And meeting with\nfriends, they always kissed in salutation, as do the Venetians:\n\n          \u201cGratatusque darem cum dulcibus oscula verbis.\u201d\n\n          [\u201cAnd kindest words I would mingle with kisses.\u201d\n           --Ovid, De Pont., iv. 9, 13]\n\nIn petitioning or saluting any great man, they used to lay their hands\nupon his knees.  Pasicles the philosopher, brother of Crates, instead of\nlaying his hand upon the knee laid it upon the private parts, and being\nroughly repulsed by him to whom he made that indecent compliment:\n\u201cWhat,\u201d said he, \u201cis not that part your own as well as the other?\u201d\n --[Diogenes Laertius, vi. 89.]--They used to eat fruit, as we do, after\ndinner.  They wiped their fundaments (let the ladies, if they please,\nmince it smaller) with a sponge, which is the reason that \u2018spongia\u2019 is a\nsmutty word in Latin; which sponge was fastened to the end of a stick, as\nappears by the story of him who, as he was led along to be thrown to the\nwild beasts in the sight of the people, asking leave to do his business,\nand having no other way to despatch himself, forced the sponge and stick\ndown his throat and choked himself.--[Seneca, Ep., 70.] They used to\nwipe, after coition, with perfumed wool:\n\n          \u201cAt tibi nil faciam; sed Iota mentula lana.\u201d\n\nThey had in the streets of Rome vessels and little tubs for passengers to\nurine in:\n\n          \u201cPusi saepe lacum propter se, ac dolia curta.\n          Somno devincti, credunt extollere vestem.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThe little boys in their sleep often think they are near the\n     public urinal, and raise their coats to make use of it.\u201d\n      --Lucretius, iv.]\n\nThey had collation betwixt meals, and had in summer cellars of snow to\ncool their wine; and some there were who made use of snow in winter, not\nthinking their wine cool enough, even at that cold season of the year.\nThe men of quality had their cupbearers and carvers, and their buffoons\nto make them sport.  They had their meat served up in winter upon chafing\ndishes, which were set upon the table, and had portable kitchens (of\nwhich I myself have seen some) wherein all their service was carried\nabout with them:\n\n               \u201cHas vobis epulas habete, lauti\n               Nos offendimur ambulante caena.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cDo you, if you please, esteem these feasts: we do not like the\n     ambulatory suppers.\u201d--Martial, vii. 48, 4.]\n\nIn summer they had a contrivance to bring fresh and clear rills through\ntheir lower rooms, wherein were great store of living fish, which the\nguests took out with their own hands to be dressed every man according to\nhis own liking.  Fish has ever had this pre-eminence, and keeps it still,\nthat the grandees, as to them, all pretend to be cooks; and indeed the\ntaste is more delicate than that of flesh, at least to my fancy.  But in\nall sorts of magnificence, debauchery, and voluptuous inventions of\neffeminacy and expense, we do, in truth, all we can to parallel them;\nfor our wills are as corrupt as theirs: but we want ability to equal\nthem.  Our force is no more able to reach them in their vicious, than in\ntheir virtuous, qualities, for both the one and the other proceeded from\na vigour of soul which was without comparison greater in them than in us;\nand souls, by how much the weaker they are, by so much have they less\npower to do either very well or very ill.\n\nThe highest place of honour amongst them was the middle.  The name going\nbefore, or following after, either in writing or speaking, had no\nsignification of grandeur, as is evident by their writings; they will as\nsoon say Oppius and Caesar, as Caesar and Oppius; and me and thee, as\nthee and me.  This is the reason that made me formerly take notice in the\nlife of Flaminius, in our French Plutarch, of one passage, where it seems\nas if the author, speaking of the jealousy of honour betwixt the\nAEtolians and Romans, about the winning of a battle they had with their\njoined forces obtained, made it of some importance, that in the Greek\nsongs they had put the AEtolians before the Romans: if there be no\namphibology in the words of the French translation.\n\nThe ladies, in their baths, made no scruple of admitting men amongst\nthem, and moreover made use of their serving-men to rub and anoint them:\n\n          \u201cInguina succinctus nigri tibi servus aluta\n          Stat, quoties calidis nuda foveris aquis.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cA slave--his middle girded with a black apron--stands before you,\n     when, naked, you take a hot bath.\u201d--Martial, vii. 35, i.]\n\nThey all powdered themselves with a certain powder, to moderate their\nsweats.\n\nThe ancient Gauls, says Sidonius Apollinaris, wore their hair long before\nand the hinder part of the head shaved, a fashion that begins to revive\nin this vicious and effeminate age.\n\nThe Romans used to pay the watermen their fare at their first stepping\ninto the boat, which we never do till after landing:\n\n               \u201cDum aes exigitur, dum mula ligatur,\n               Tota abit hora.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cWhilst the fare\u2019s paying, and the mule is being harnessed, a whole\n     hour\u2019s time is past.\u201d--Horace, Sat. i. 5, 13.]\n\nThe women used to lie on the side of the bed next the wall: and for that\nreason they called Caesar,\n\n                    \u201cSpondam regis Nicomedis,\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThe bed of King Nicomedes.\u201d--Suetonius, Life of Caesar, 49.]\n\nThey took breath in their drinking, and watered their wine\n\n                   \u201cQuis puer ocius\n                    Restinguet ardentis Falerni\n                    Pocula praetereunte lympha?\u201d\n\n     [\u201cWhat boy will quickly come and cool the heat of the Falernian\n     wine with clear water?\u201d--Horace, Od., ii. z, 18.]\n\nAnd the roguish looks and gestures of our lackeys were also in use\namongst them:\n\n          \u201cO Jane, a tergo quern nulls ciconia pinsit,\n          Nec manus, auriculas imitari est mobilis albas,\n          Nec lingua, quantum sitiat canis Appula, tantum.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cO Janus, whom no crooked fingers, simulating a stork, peck at\n     behind your back, whom no quick hands deride behind you, by\n     imitating the motion of the white ears of the ass, against whom no\n     mocking tongue is thrust out, as the tongue of the thirsty Apulian\n     dog.\u201d--Persius, i. 58.]\n\nThe Argian and Roman ladies mourned in white, as ours did formerly and\nshould do still, were I to govern in this point.  But there are whole\nbooks on this subject.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER L\n\nOF DEMOCRITUS AND HERACLITUS\n\nThe judgment is an utensil proper for all subjects, and will have an oar\nin everything: which is the reason, that in these Essays I take hold of\nall occasions where, though it happen to be a subject I do not very well\nunderstand, I try, however, sounding it at a distance, and finding it too\ndeep for my stature, I keep me on the shore; and this knowledge that a\nman can proceed no further, is one effect of its virtue, yes, one of\nthose of which it is most proud.  One while in an idle and frivolous\nsubject, I try to find out matter whereof to compose a body, and then to\nprop and support it; another while, I employ it in a noble subject, one\nthat has been tossed and tumbled by a thousand hands, wherein a man can\nscarce possibly introduce anything of his own, the way being so beaten on\nevery side that he must of necessity walk in the steps of another: in\nsuch a case, \u2018tis the work of the judgment to take the way that seems\nbest, and of a thousand paths, to determine that this or that is the\nbest.  I leave the choice of my arguments to fortune, and take that she\nfirst presents to me; they are all alike to me, I never design to go\nthrough any of them; for I never see all of anything: neither do they who\nso largely promise to show it others.  Of a hundred members and faces\nthat everything has, I take one, onewhile to look it over only, another\nwhile to ripple up the skin, and sometimes to pinch it to the bones: I\ngive a stab, not so wide but as deep as I can, and am for the most part\ntempted to take it in hand by some new light I discover in it.  Did I\nknow myself less, I might perhaps venture to handle something or other to\nthe bottom, and to be deceived in my own inability; but sprinkling here\none word and there another, patterns cut from several pieces and\nscattered without design and without engaging myself too far, I am not\nresponsible for them, or obliged to keep close to my subject, without\nvarying at my own liberty and pleasure, and giving up myself to doubt and\nuncertainty, and to my own governing method, ignorance.\n\nAll motion discovers us: the very same soul of Caesar, that made itself\nso conspicuous in marshalling and commanding the battle of Pharsalia, was\nalso seen as solicitous and busy in the softer affairs of love and\nleisure.  A man makes a judgment of a horse, not only by seeing him when\nhe is showing off his paces, but by his very walk, nay, and by seeing him\nstand in the stable.\n\nAmongst the functions of the soul, there are some of a lower and meaner\nform; he who does not see her in those inferior offices as well as in\nthose of nobler note, never fully discovers her; and, peradventure, she\nis best shown where she moves her simpler pace.  The winds of passions\ntake most hold of her in her highest flights; and the rather by reason\nthat she wholly applies herself to, and exercises her whole virtue upon,\nevery particular subject, and never handles more than one thing at a\ntime, and that not according to it, but according to herself.  Things in\nrespect to themselves have, peradventure, their weight, measures, and\nconditions; but when we once take them into us, the soul forms them as\nshe pleases.  Death is terrible to Cicero, coveted by Cato, indifferent\nto Socrates.  Health, conscience, authority, knowledge, riches, beauty,\nand their contraries, all strip themselves at their entering into us, and\nreceive a new robe, and of another fashion, from the soul; and of what\ncolour, brown, bright, green, dark, and of what quality, sharp, sweet,\ndeep, or superficial, as best pleases each of them, for they are not\nagreed upon any common standard of forms, rules, or proceedings; every\none is a queen in her own dominions.  Let us, therefore, no more excuse\nourselves upon the external qualities of things; it belongs to us to give\nourselves an account of them.  Our good or ill has no other dependence\nbut on ourselves.  \u2018Tis there that our offerings and our vows are due,\nand not to fortune she has no power over our manners; on the contrary,\nthey draw and make her follow in their train, and cast her in their own\nmould.  Why should not I judge of Alexander at table, ranting and\ndrinking at the prodigious rate he sometimes used to do?\n\nOr, if he played at chess?  what string of his soul was not touched by\nthis idle and childish game?  I hate and avoid it, because it is not play\nenough, that it is too grave and serious a diversion, and I am ashamed to\nlay out as much thought and study upon it as would serve to much better\nuses.  He did not more pump his brains about his glorious expedition into\nthe Indies, nor than another in unravelling a passage upon which depends\nthe safety of mankind.  To what a degree does this ridiculous diversion\nmolest the soul, when all her faculties are summoned together upon this\ntrivial account! and how fair an opportunity she herein gives every one\nto know and to make a right judgment of himself?  I do not more\nthoroughly sift myself in any other posture than this: what passion are\nwe exempted from in it?  Anger, spite, malice, impatience, and a vehement\ndesire of getting the better in a concern wherein it were more excusable\nto be ambitious of being overcome; for to be eminent, to excel above the\ncommon rate in frivolous things, nowise befits a man of honour.  What I\nsay in this example may be said in all others.  Every particle, every\nemployment of man manifests him equally with any other.\n\nDemocritus and Heraclitus were two philosophers, of whom the first,\nfinding human condition ridiculous and vain, never appeared abroad but\nwith a jeering and laughing countenance; whereas Heraclitus commiserating\nthat same condition of ours, appeared always with a sorrowful look, and\ntears in his eyes:\n\n               \u201cAlter\n               Ridebat, quoties a limine moverat unum\n               Protuleratque pedem; flebat contrarius alter.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThe one always, as often as he had stepped one pace from his\n     threshold, laughed, the other always wept.\u201d--Juvenal, Sat., x. 28.]\n\n          [Or, as Voltaire: \u201cLife is a comedy to those who think;\n          a tragedy to those who feel.\u201d  D.W.]\n\nI am clearly for the first humour; not because it is more pleasant to\nlaugh than to weep, but because it expresses more contempt and\ncondemnation than the other, and I think we can never be despised\naccording to our full desert.  Compassion and bewailing seem to imply\nsome esteem of and value for the thing bemoaned; whereas the things we\nlaugh at are by that expressed to be of no moment.  I do not think that\nwe are so unhappy as we are vain, or have in us so much malice as folly;\nwe are not so full of mischief as inanity; nor so miserable as we are\nvile and mean.  And therefore Diogenes, who passed away his time in\nrolling himself in his tub, and made nothing of the great Alexander,\nesteeming us no better than flies or bladders puffed up with wind, was a\nsharper and more penetrating, and, consequently in my opinion, a juster\njudge than Timon, surnamed the Man-hater; for what a man hates he lays to\nheart.  This last was an enemy to all mankind, who passionately desired\nour ruin, and avoided our conversation as dangerous, proceeding from\nwicked and depraved natures: the other valued us so little that we could\nneither trouble nor infect him by our example; and left us to herd one\nwith another, not out of fear, but from contempt of our society:\nconcluding us as incapable of doing good as evil.\n\nOf the same strain was Statilius\u2019 answer, when Brutus courted him into\nthe conspiracy against Caesar; he was satisfied that the enterprise was\njust, but he did not think mankind worthy of a wise man\u2019s concern\u2019;\naccording to the doctrine of Hegesias, who said, that a wise man ought to\ndo nothing but for himself, forasmuch as he only was worthy of it: and to\nthe saying of Theodorus, that it was not reasonable a wise man should\nhazard himself for his country, and endanger wisdom for a company of\nfools.  Our condition is as ridiculous as risible.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LI\n\nOF THE VANITY OF WORDS\n\nA rhetorician of times past said, that to make little things appear great\nwas his profession.  This was a shoemaker, who can make a great shoe for\na little foot.--[A saying of Agesilaus.]--They would in Sparta have\nsent such a fellow to be whipped for making profession of a tricky and\ndeceitful act; and I fancy that Archidamus, who was king of that country,\nwas a little surprised at the answer of Thucydides, when inquiring of\nhim, which was the better wrestler, Pericles, or he, he replied, that it\nwas hard to affirm; for when I have thrown him, said he, he always\npersuades the spectators that he had no fall and carries away the prize.\n--[Quintilian, ii.  15.]--The women who paint, pounce, and plaster up\ntheir ruins, filling up their wrinkles and deformities, are less to\nblame, because it is no great matter whether we see them in their natural\ncomplexions; whereas these make it their business to deceive not our\nsight only but our judgments, and to adulterate and corrupt the very\nessence of things.  The republics that have maintained themselves in a\nregular and well-modelled government, such as those of Lacedaemon and\nCrete, had orators in no very great esteem.  Aristo wisely defined\nrhetoric to be \u201ca science to persuade the people;\u201d Socrates and Plato\n\u201can art to flatter and deceive.\u201d  And those who deny it in the general\ndescription, verify it throughout in their precepts.  The Mohammedans\nwill not suffer their children to be instructed in it, as being useless,\nand the Athenians, perceiving of how pernicious consequence the practice\nof it was, it being in their city of universal esteem, ordered the\nprincipal part, which is to move the affections, with their exordiums and\nperorations, to be taken away.  \u2018Tis an engine invented to manage and\ngovern a disorderly and tumultuous rabble, and that never is made use of,\nbut like physic to the sick, in a discomposed state.  In those where the\nvulgar or the ignorant, or both together, have been all-powerful and able\nto give the law, as in those of Athens, Rhodes, and Rome, and where the\npublic affairs have been in a continual tempest of commotion, to such\nplaces have the orators always repaired.  And in truth, we shall find few\npersons in those republics who have pushed their fortunes to any great\ndegree of eminence without the assistance of eloquence.\n\nPompey, Caesar, Crassus, Lucullus, Lentulus, Metellus, thence took their\nchiefest spring, to mount to that degree of authority at which they at\nlast arrived, making it of greater use to them than arms, contrary to the\nopinion of better times; for, L. Volumnius speaking publicly in favour of\nthe election of Q. Fabius and Pub. Decius, to the consular dignity:\n\u201cThese are men,\u201d said he, \u201cborn for war and great in execution; in the\ncombat of the tongue altogether wanting; spirits truly consular.  The\nsubtle, eloquent, and learned are only good for the city, to make\npraetors of, to administer justice.\u201d--[Livy, x. 22.]\n\nEloquence most flourished at Rome when the public affairs were in the\nworst condition and most disquieted with intestine commotions; as a free\nand untilled soil bears the worst weeds.  By which it should seem that a\nmonarchical government has less need of it than any other: for the\nstupidity and facility natural to the common people, and that render them\nsubject to be turned and twined and, led by the ears by this charming\nharmony of words, without weighing or considering the truth and reality\nof things by the force of reason: this facility, I say, is not easily\nfound in a single person, and it is also more easy by good education and\nadvice to secure him from the impression of this poison.  There was never\nany famous orator known to come out of Persia or Macedon.\n\nI have entered into this discourse upon the occasion of an Italian I\nlately received into my service, and who was clerk of the kitchen to the\nlate Cardinal Caraffa till his death.  I put this fellow upon an account\nof his office: when he fell to discourse of this palate-science, with\nsuch a settled countenance and magisterial gravity, as if he had been\nhandling some profound point of divinity.  He made a learned distinction\nof the several sorts of appetites; of that a man has before he begins to\neat, and of those after the second and third service; the means simply to\nsatisfy the first, and then to raise and actuate the other two; the\nordering of the sauces, first in general, and then proceeded to the\nqualities of the ingredients and their effects; the differences of salads\naccording to their seasons, those which ought to be served up hot, and\nwhich cold; the manner of their garnishment and decoration to render them\nacceptable to the eye.  After which he entered upon the order of the\nwhole service, full of weighty and important considerations:\n\n               \u201cNec minimo sane discrimine refert,\n               Quo gestu lepores, et quo gallina secetur;\u201d\n\n     [\u201cNor with less discrimination observes how we should carve a hare,\n     and how a hen.\u201d or, (\u201cNor with the least discrimination relates how\n     we should carve hares, and how cut up a hen.)\u201d\n      --Juvenal, Sat., v. 123.]\n\nand all this set out with lofty and magnificent words, the very same we\nmake use of when we discourse of the government of an empire.  Which\nlearned lecture of my man brought this of Terence into my memory:\n\n         \u201cHoc salsum est, hoc adustum est, hoc lautum est, parum:\n          Illud recte: iterum sic memento: sedulo\n          Moneo, qux possum, pro mea sapientia.\n          Postremo, tanquam in speculum, in patinas,\n          Demea, Inspicere jubeo, et moneo, quid facto usus sit.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThis is too salt, that\u2019s burnt, that\u2019s not washed enough; that\u2019s\n     well; remember to do so another time.  Thus do I ever advise them to\n     have things done properly, according to my capacity; and lastly,\n     Demea, I command my cooks to look into every dish as if it were a\n     mirror, and tell them what they should do.\u201d\n      --Terence, Adelph., iii. 3, 71.]\n\nAnd yet even the Greeks themselves very much admired and highly applauded\nthe order and disposition that Paulus AEmilius observed in the feast he\ngave them at his return from Macedon.  But I do not here speak of\neffects, I speak of words only.\n\nI do not know whether it may have the same operation upon other men that\nit has upon me, but when I hear our architects thunder out their bombast\nwords of pilasters, architraves, and cornices, of the Corinthian and\nDoric orders, and suchlike jargon, my imagination is presently possessed\nwith the palace of Apollidon; when, after all, I find them but the paltry\npieces of my own kitchen door.\n\nTo hear men talk of metonomies, metaphors, and allegories, and other\ngrammar words, would not one think they signified some rare and exotic\nform of speaking?  And yet they are phrases that come near to the babble\nof my chambermaid.\n\nAnd this other is a gullery of the same stamp, to call the offices of our\nkingdom by the lofty titles of the Romans, though they have no similitude\nof function, and still less of authority and power.  And this also, which\nI doubt will one day turn to the reproach of this age of ours, unworthily\nand indifferently to confer upon any we think fit the most glorious\nsurnames with which antiquity honoured but one or two persons in several\nages.  Plato carried away the surname of Divine, by so universal a\nconsent that never any one repined at it, or attempted to take it from\nhim; and yet the Italians, who pretend, and with good reason, to more\nsprightly wits and sounder sense than the other nations of their time,\nhave lately bestowed the same title upon Aretin, in whose writings, save\ntumid phrases set out with smart periods, ingenious indeed but\nfar-fetched and fantastic, and the eloquence, be it what it may, I see\nnothing in him above the ordinary writers of his time, so far is he from\napproaching the ancient divinity.  And we make nothing of giving the\nsurname of great to princes who have nothing more than ordinary in them.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LII\n\nOF THE PARSIMONY OF THE ANCIENTS\n\nAttilius Regulus, general of the Roman army in Africa, in the height of\nall his glory and victories over the Carthaginians, wrote to the Republic\nto acquaint them that a certain hind he had left in trust with his\nestate, which was in all but seven acres of land, had run away with all\nhis instruments of husbandry, and entreating therefore, that they would\nplease to call him home that he might take order in his own affairs, lest\nhis wife and children should suffer by this disaster.  Whereupon the\nSenate appointed another to manage his business, caused his losses to be\nmade good, and ordered his family to be maintained at the public expense.\n\nThe elder Cato, returning consul from Spain, sold his warhorse to save\nthe money it would have cost in bringing it back by sea into Italy; and\nbeing Governor of Sardinia, he made all his visits on foot, without other\ntrain than one officer of the Republic who carried his robe and a censer\nfor sacrifices, and for the most part carried his trunk himself.  He\nbragged that he had never worn a gown that cost above ten crowns, nor had\never sent above tenpence to the market for one day\u2019s provision; and that\nas to his country houses, he had not one that was rough-cast on the\noutside.\n\nScipio AEmilianus, after two triumphs and two consulships, went an\nembassy with no more than seven servants in his train.  \u2018Tis said that\nHomer had never more than one, Plato three, and Zeno, founder of the sect\nof Stoics, none at all.  Tiberius Gracchus was allowed but fivepence\nhalfpenny a day when employed as public minister about the public\naffairs, and being at that time the greatest man of Rome.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LIII\n\nOF A SAYING OF CAESAR\n\nIf we would sometimes bestow a little consideration upon ourselves, and\nemploy the time we spend in prying into other men\u2019s actions, and\ndiscovering things without us, in examining our own abilities we should\nsoon perceive of how infirm and decaying material this fabric of ours is\ncomposed.  Is it not a singular testimony of imperfection that we cannot\nestablish our satisfaction in any one thing, and that even our own fancy\nand desire should deprive us of the power to choose what is most proper\nand useful for us?  A very good proof of this is the great dispute that\nhas ever been amongst the philosophers, of finding out man\u2019s sovereign\ngood, that continues yet, and will eternally continue, without solution\nor accord:\n\n              \u201cDum abest quod avemus, id exsuperare videtur\n               Caetera; post aliud, quum contigit illud, avemus,\n               Et sitis aequa tenet.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cWhile that which we desire is wanting, it seems to surpass all the\n     rest; then, when we have got it, we want something else; \u2018tis ever\n     the same thirst\u201d--Lucretius, iii. 1095.]\n\nWhatever it is that falls into our knowledge and possession, we find that\nit satisfies not, and we still pant after things to come and unknown,\ninasmuch as those present do not suffice for us; not that, in my\njudgment, they have not in them wherewith to do it, but because we seize\nthem with an unruly and immoderate haste:\n\n         \u201cNam quum vidit hic, ad victum qux flagitat usus,\n          Et per quae possent vitam consistere tutam,\n          Omnia jam ferme mortalibus esse parata;\n          Divitiis homines, et honore, et laude potentes\n          Aflluere, atque bona natorum excellere fama;\n          Nec minus esse domi cuiquam tamen anxia corda,\n          Atque animi ingratis vitam vexare querelis\n          Causam, quae infestis cogit saevire querelis,\n          Intellegit ibi; vitium vas efficere ipsum,\n          Omniaque, illius vitio, corrumpier intus,\n          Qux collata foris et commoda quomque venirent.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cFor when he saw that almost all things necessarily required for\n     subsistence, and which may render life comfortable, are already\n     prepared to their hand, that men may abundantly attain wealth,\n     honour, praise, may rejoice in the reputation of their children, yet\n     that, notwithstanding, every one has none the less in his heart and\n     home anxieties and a mind enslaved by wearing complaints, he saw\n     that the vessel itself was in fault, and that all good things which\n     were brought into it from without were spoilt by its own\n     imperfections.\u201d--Lucretius, vi. 9.]\n\nOur appetite is irresolute and fickle; it can neither keep nor enjoy\nanything with a good grace: and man concluding it to be the fault of the\nthings he is possessed of, fills himself with and feeds upon the idea of\nthings he neither knows nor understands, to which he devotes his hopes\nand his desires, paying them all reverence and honour, according to the\nsaying of Caesar:\n\n          \u201cCommuni fit vitio naturae, ut invisis, latitantibus\n          atque incognitis rebus magis confidamas,\n          vehementiusque exterreamur.\u201d\n\n     [\u201c\u2018Tis the common vice of nature, that we at once repose most\n     confidence, and receive the greatest apprehensions, from things\n     unseen, concealed, and unknown.\u201d--De Bello Civil, xi. 4.]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LIV\n\nOF VAIN SUBTLETIES\n\nThere are a sort of little knacks and frivolous subtleties from which men\nsometimes expect to derive reputation and applause: as poets, who compose\nwhole poems with every line beginning with the same letter; we see the\nshapes of eggs, globes, wings, and hatchets cut out by the ancient Greeks\nby the measure of their verses, making them longer or shorter, to\nrepresent such or such a figure.  Of this nature was his employment who\nmade it his business to compute into how many several orders the letters\nof the alphabet might be transposed, and found out that incredible number\nmentioned in Plutarch.  I am mightily pleased with the humour of him,\n\n     [\u201cAlexander, as may be seen in Quintil., Institut.  Orat., lib.\n     ii., cap. 20, where he defines Maratarexvia to be a certain\n     unnecessary imitation of art, which really does neither good nor\n     harm, but is as unprofitable and ridiculous as was the labour of\n     that man who had so perfectly learned to cast small peas through the\n     eye of a needle at a good distance that he never missed one, and was\n     justly rewarded for it, as is said, by Alexander, who saw the\n     performance, with a bushel of peas.\u201d--Coste.]\n\nwho having a man brought before him that had learned to throw a grain of\nmillet with such dexterity and assurance as never to miss the eye of a\nneedle; and being afterwards entreated to give something for the reward\nof so rare a performance, he pleasantly, and in my opinion justly,\nordered a certain number of bushels of the same grain to be delivered to\nhim, that he might not want wherewith to exercise so famous an art.  \u2018Tis\na strong evidence of a weak judgment when men approve of things for their\nbeing rare and new, or for their difficulty, where worth and usefulness\nare not conjoined to recommend them.\n\nI come just now from playing with my own family at who could find out the\nmost things that hold by their two extremities; as Sire, which is a title\ngiven to the greatest person in the nation, the king, and also to the\nvulgar, as merchants, but never to any degree of men between.  The women\nof great quality are called Dames, inferior gentlewomen, Demoiselles, and\nthe meanest sort of women, Dames, as the first.  The cloth of state over\nour tables is not permitted but in the palaces of princes and in taverns.\nDemocritus said, that gods and beasts had sharper sense than men, who are\nof a middle form.  The Romans wore the same habit at funerals and feasts.\nIt is most certain that an extreme fear and an extreme ardour of courage\nequally trouble and relax the belly.  The nickname of Trembling with\nwhich they surnamed Sancho XII., king of Navarre, tells us that valour\nwill cause a trembling in the limbs as well as fear.  Those who were\narming that king, or some other person, who upon the like occasion was\nwont to be in the same disorder, tried to compose him by representing the\ndanger less he was going to engage himself in: \u201cYou understand me ill,\u201d\n said he, \u201cfor could my flesh know the danger my courage will presently\ncarry it into, it would sink down to the ground.\u201d  The faintness that\nsurprises us from frigidity or dislike in the exercises of Venus are also\noccasioned by a too violent desire and an immoderate heat.  Extreme\ncoldness and extreme heat boil and roast.  Aristotle says, that sows of\nlead will melt and run with cold and the rigour of winter just as with a\nvehement heat.  Desire and satiety fill all the gradations above and\nbelow pleasure with pain.  Stupidity and wisdom meet in the same centre\nof sentiment and resolution, in the suffering of human accidents.  The\nwise control and triumph over ill, the others know it not: these last\nare, as a man may say, on this side of accidents, the others are beyond\nthem, who after having well weighed and considered their qualities,\nmeasured and judged them what they are, by virtue of a vigorous soul leap\nout of their reach; they disdain and trample them underfoot, having a\nsolid and well-fortified soul, against which the darts of fortune, coming\nto strike, must of necessity rebound and blunt themselves, meeting with a\nbody upon which they can fix no impression; the ordinary and middle\ncondition of men are lodged betwixt these two extremities, consisting of\nsuch as perceive evils, feel them, and are not able to support them.\nInfancy and decrepitude meet in the imbecility of the brain; avarice and\nprofusion in the same thirst and desire of getting.\n\nA man may say with some colour of truth that there is an Abecedarian\nignorance that precedes knowledge, and a doctoral ignorance that comes\nafter it: an ignorance that knowledge creates and begets, at the same\ntime that it despatches and destroys the first.  Of mean understandings,\nlittle inquisitive, and little instructed, are made good Christians, who\nby reverence and obedience simply believe and are constant in their\nbelief.  In the average understandings and the middle sort of capacities,\nthe error of opinion is begotten; they follow the appearance of the first\nimpression, and have some colour of reason on their side to impute our\nwalking on in the old beaten path to simplicity and stupidity, meaning us\nwho have not informed ourselves by study.  The higher and nobler souls,\nmore solid and clear-sighted, make up another sort of true believers, who\nby a long and religious investigation of truth, have obtained a clearer\nand more penetrating light into the Scriptures, and have discovered the\nmysterious and divine secret of our ecclesiastical polity; and yet we see\nsome, who by the middle step, have arrived at that supreme degree with\nmarvellous fruit and confirmation, as to the utmost limit of Christian\nintelligence, and enjoy their victory with great spiritual consolation,\nhumble acknowledgment of the divine favour, reformation of manners, and\nsingular modesty.  I do not intend with these to rank those others, who\nto clear themselves from all suspicion of their former errors and to\nsatisfy us that they are sound and firm, render themselves extremely\nindiscreet and unjust, in the carrying on our cause, and blemish it with\ninfinite reproaches of violence and oppression.  The simple peasants are\ngood people, and so are the philosophers, or whatever the present age\ncalls them, men of strong and clear reason, and whose souls are enriched\nwith an ample instruction of profitable sciences.  The mongrels who have\ndisdained the first form of the ignorance of letters, and have not been\nable to attain to the other (sitting betwixt two stools, as I and a great\nmany more of us do), are dangerous, foolish, and importunate; these are\nthey that trouble the world.  And therefore it is that I, for my own\npart, retreat as much as I can towards the first and natural station,\nwhence I so vainly attempted to advance.\n\nPopular and purely natural poesy\n\n     [\u201cThe term poesie populaire was employed, for the first time, in the\n     French language on this occasion.  Montaigne created the expression,\n     and indicated its nature.\u201d--Ampere.]\n\nhas in it certain artless graces, by which she may come into comparison\nwith the greatest beauty of poetry perfected by art: as we see in our\nGascon villanels and the songs that are brought us from nations that have\nno knowledge of any manner of science, nor so much as the use of writing.\nThe middle sort of poesy betwixt these two is despised, of no value,\nhonour, or esteem.\n\nBut seeing that the path once laid open to the fancy, I have found, as it\ncommonly falls out, that what we have taken for a difficult exercise and\na rare subject, prove to be nothing so, and that after the invention is\nonce warm, it finds out an infinite number of parallel examples.  I shall\nonly add this one--that, were these Essays of mine considerable enough to\ndeserve a critical judgment, it might then, I think, fall out that they\nwould not much take with common and vulgar capacities, nor be very\nacceptable to the singular and excellent sort of men; the first would not\nunderstand them enough, and the last too much; and so they may hover in\nthe middle region.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LV\n\nOF SMELLS\n\nIt has been reported of some, as of Alexander the Great, that their sweat\nexhaled an odoriferous smell, occasioned by some rare and extraordinary\nconstitution, of which Plutarch and others have been inquisitive into the\ncause.  But the ordinary constitution of human bodies is quite otherwise,\nand their best and chiefest excellency is to be exempt from smell.  Nay,\nthe sweetness even of the purest breath has nothing in it of greater\nperfection than to be without any offensive smell, like those of\nhealthful children, which made Plautus say of a woman:\n\n               \u201cMulier tum bene olet, ubi nihil olet.\u201d\n\n          [\u201cShe smells sweetest, who smells not at all.\u201d\n           --Plautus, Mostel, i. 3, 116.]\n\nAnd such as make use of fine exotic perfumes are with good reason to be\nsuspected of some natural imperfection which they endeavour by these\nodours to conceal.  To smell, though well, is to stink:\n\n              \u201cRides nos, Coracine, nil olentes\n               Malo, quam bene olere, nil olere.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cYou laugh at us, Coracinus, because we are not scented; I would,\n     rather than smell well, not smell at all.\u201d--Martial, vi. 55, 4.]\n\nAnd elsewhere:\n\n          \u201cPosthume, non bene olet, qui bene semper olet.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cPosthumus, he who ever smells well does not smell well.\u201d\n      --Idem, ii. 12, 14.]\n\nI am nevertheless a great lover of good smells, and as much abominate the\nill ones, which also I scent at a greater distance, I think, than other\nmen:\n\n              \u201cNamque sagacius unus odoror,\n               Polypus, an gravis hirsutis cubet hircus in aliis\n               Quam canis acer, ubi latest sus.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cMy nose is quicker to scent a fetid sore or a rank armpit, than a\n     dog to smell out the hidden sow.\u201d--Horace, Epod., xii.  4.]\n\nOf smells, the simple and natural seem to me the most pleasing.  Let the\nladies look to that, for \u2018tis chiefly their concern: amid the most\nprofound barbarism, the Scythian women, after bathing, were wont to\npowder and crust their faces and all their bodies with a certain\nodoriferous drug growing in their country, which being cleansed off, when\nthey came to have familiarity with men they were found perfumed and\nsleek.  \u2018Tis not to be believed how strangely all sorts of odours cleave\nto me, and how apt my skin is to imbibe them.  He that complains of\nnature that she has not furnished mankind with a vehicle to convey smells\nto the nose had no reason; for they will do it themselves, especially to\nme; my very mustachios, which are full, perform that office; for if I\nstroke them but with my gloves or handkerchief, the smell will not out a\nwhole day; they manifest where I have been, and the close, luscious,\ndevouring, viscid melting kisses of youthful ardour in my wanton age left\na sweetness upon my lips for several hours after.  And yet I have ever\nfound myself little subject to epidemic diseases, that are caught, either\nby conversing with the sick or bred by the contagion of the air, and have\nescaped from those of my time, of which there have been several sorts in\nour cities and armies.  We read of Socrates, that though he never\ndeparted from Athens during the frequent plagues that infested the city,\nhe only was never infected.\n\nPhysicians might, I believe, extract greater utility from odours than\nthey do, for I have often observed that they cause an alteration in me\nand work upon my spirits according to their several virtues; which makes\nme approve of what is said, that the use of incense and perfumes in\nchurches, so ancient and so universally received in all nations and\nreligions, was intended to cheer us, and to rouse and purify the senses,\nthe better to fit us for contemplation.\n\nI could have been glad, the better to judge of it, to have tasted the\nculinary art of those cooks who had so rare a way of seasoning exotic\nodours with the relish of meats; as it was particularly observed in the\nservice of the king of Tunis, who in our days--[Muley-Hassam, in 1543.]\n--landed at Naples to have an interview with Charles the Emperor.  His\ndishes were larded with odoriferous drugs, to that degree of expense that\nthe cookery of one peacock and two pheasants amounted to a hundred ducats\nto dress them after their fashion; and when the carver came to cut them\nup, not only the dining-room, but all the apartments of his palace and\nthe adjoining streets were filled with an aromatic vapour which did not\npresently vanish.\n\nMy chiefest care in choosing my lodgings is always to avoid a thick and\nstinking air; and those beautiful cities, Venice and Paris, very much\nlessen the kindness I have for them, the one by the offensive smell of\nher marshes, and the other of her dirt.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LVI\n\nOF PRAYERS\n\nI propose formless and undetermined fancies, like those who publish\ndoubtful questions, to be after a disputed upon in the schools, not to\nestablish truth but to seek it; and I submit them to the judgments of\nthose whose office it is to regulate, not my writings and actions only,\nbut moreover my very thoughts.  Let what I here set down meet with\ncorrection or applause, it shall be of equal welcome and utility to me,\nmyself beforehand condemning as absurd and impious, if anything shall be\nfound, through ignorance or inadvertency, couched in this rhapsody,\ncontrary to the holy resolutions and prescriptions of the Catholic\nApostolic and Roman Church, into which I was born and in which I will\ndie.  And yet, always submitting to the authority of their censure, which\nhas an absolute power over me, I thus rashly venture at everything, as in\ntreating upon this present subject.\n\nI know not if or no I am wrong, but since, by a particular favour of the\ndivine bounty, a certain form of prayer has been prescribed and dictated\nto us, word by word, from the mouth of God Himself, I have ever been of\nopinion that we ought to have it in more frequent use than we yet have;\nand if I were worthy to advise, at the sitting down to and rising from\nour tables, at our rising from and going to bed, and in every particular\naction wherein prayer is used, I would that Christians always make use of\nthe Lord\u2019s Prayer, if not alone, yet at least always.  The Church may\nlengthen and diversify prayers, according to the necessity of our\ninstruction, for I know very well that it is always the same in substance\nand the same thing: but yet such a privilege ought to be given to that\nprayer, that the people should have it continually in their mouths; for\nit is most certain that all necessary petitions are comprehended in it,\nand that it is infinitely proper for all occasions.  \u2018Tis the only prayer\nI use in all places and conditions, and which I still repeat instead of\nchanging; whence it also happens that I have no other so entirely by\nheart as that.\n\nIt just now came into my mind, whence it is we should derive that error\nof having recourse to God in all our designs and enterprises, to call Him\nto our assistance in all sorts of affairs, and in all places where our\nweakness stands in need of support, without considering whether the\noccasion be just or otherwise; and to invoke His name and power, in what\nstate soever we are, or action we are engaged in, howsoever vicious.  He\nis indeed, our sole and unique protector, and can do all things for us:\nbut though He is pleased to honour us with this sweet paternal alliance,\nHe is, notwithstanding, as just as He is good and mighty; and more often\nexercises His justice than His power, and favours us according to that,\nand not according to our petitions.\n\nPlato in his Laws, makes three sorts of belief injurious to the gods;\n\u201cthat there are none; that they concern not themselves about our affairs;\nthat they never refuse anything to our vows, offerings, and sacrifices.\u201d\n The first of these errors (according to his opinion, never continued\nrooted in any man from his infancy to his old age); the other two, he\nconfesses, men might be obstinate in.\n\nGod\u2019s justice and His power are inseparable; \u2018tis in vain we invoke His\npower in an unjust cause.  We are to have our souls pure and clean, at\nthat moment at least wherein we pray to Him, and purified from all\nvicious passions; otherwise we ourselves present Him the rods wherewith\nto chastise us; instead of repairing anything we have done amiss, we\ndouble the wickedness and the offence when we offer to Him, to whom we\nare to sue for pardon, an affection full of irreverence and hatred.\nWhich makes me not very apt to applaud those whom I observe to be so\nfrequent on their knees, if the actions nearest to the prayer do not give\nme some evidence of amendment and reformation:\n\n              \u201cSi, nocturnus adulter,\n               Tempora Santonico velas adoperta cucullo.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cIf a night adulterer, thou coverest thy head with a Santonic\n     cowl.\u201d--Juvenal, Sat., viii.  144.--The Santones were the people\n     who inhabited Saintonge in France, from whom the Romans derived the\n     use of hoods or cowls covering the head and face.]\n\nAnd the practice of a man who mixes devotion with an execrable life seems\nin some sort more to be condemned than that of a man conformable to his\nown propension and dissolute throughout; and for that reason it is that\nour Church denies admittance to and communion with men obstinate and\nincorrigible in any notorious wickedness.  We pray only by custom and for\nfashion\u2019s sake; or rather, we read or pronounce our prayers aloud, which\nis no better than an hypocritical show of devotion; and I am scandalised\nto see a man cross himself thrice at the Benedicite, and as often at\nGrace (and the more, because it is a sign I have in great veneration and\ncontinual use, even when I yawn), and to dedicate all the other hours of\nthe day to acts of malice, avarice, and injustice.  One hour to God, the\nrest to the devil, as if by composition and compensation.  \u2018Tis a wonder\nto see actions so various in themselves succeed one another with such an\nuniformity of method as not to interfere nor suffer any alteration, even\nupon the very confines and passes from the one to the other.  What a\nprodigious conscience must that be that can be at quiet within itself\nwhilst it harbours under the same roof, with so agreeing and so calm a\nsociety, both the crime and the judge?\n\nA man whose whole meditation is continually working upon nothing but\nimpurity which he knows to be so odious to Almighty God, what can he say\nwhen he comes to speak to Him?  He draws back, but immediately falls into\na relapse.  If the object of divine justice and the presence of his Maker\ndid, as he pretends, strike and chastise his soul, how short soever the\nrepentance might be, the very fear of offending the Infinite Majesty\nwould so often present itself to his imagination that he would soon see\nhimself master of those vices that are most natural and vehement in him.\nBut what shall we say of those who settle their whole course of life upon\nthe profit and emolument of sins, which they know to be mortal?  How many\ntrades and vocations have we admitted and countenanced amongst us, whose\nvery essence is vicious?  And he that, confessing himself to me,\nvoluntarily told me that he had all his lifetime professed and practised\na religion, in his opinion damnable and contrary to that he had in his\nheart, only to preserve his credit and the honour of his employments, how\ncould his courage suffer so infamous a confession?  What can men say to\nthe divine justice upon this subject?\n\nTheir repentance consisting in a visible and manifest reparation, they\nlose the colour of alleging it both to God and man.  Are they so impudent\nas to sue for remission without satisfaction and without penitence?\nI look upon these as in the same condition with the first: but the\nobstinacy is not there so easy to be overcome.  This contrariety and\nvolubility of opinion so sudden, so violent, that they feign, are a kind\nof miracle to me: they present us with the state of an indigestible agony\nof mind.\n\nIt seemed to me a fantastic imagination in those who, these late years\npast, were wont to reproach every man they knew to be of any\nextraordinary parts, and made profession of the Catholic religion, that\nit was but outwardly; maintaining, moreover, to do him honour forsooth,\nthat whatever he might pretend to the contrary he could not but in his\nheart be of their reformed opinion.  An untoward disease, that a man\nshould be so riveted to his own belief as to fancy that others cannot\nbelieve otherwise than as he does; and yet worse, that they should\nentertain so vicious an opinion of such great parts as to think any man\nso qualified, should prefer any present advantage of fortune to the\npromises of eternal life and the menaces of eternal damnation.  They may\nbelieve me: could anything have tempted my youth, the ambition of the\ndanger and difficulties in the late commotions had not been the least\nmotives.\n\nIt is not without very good reason, in my opinion, that the Church\ninterdicts the promiscuous, indiscreet, and irreverent use of the holy\nand divine Psalms, with which the Holy Ghost inspired King David.  We\nought not to mix God in our actions, but with the highest reverence and\ncaution; that poesy is too holy to be put to no other use than to\nexercise the lungs and to delight our ears; it ought to come from the\nconscience, and not from the tongue.  It is not fit that a prentice in\nhis shop, amongst his vain and frivolous thoughts, should be permitted to\npass away his time and divert himself with such sacred things.  Neither\nis it decent to see the Holy Book of the holy mysteries of our belief\ntumbled up and down a hall or a kitchen they were formerly mysteries, but\nare now become sports and recreations.  \u2018Tis a book too serious and too\nvenerable to be cursorily or slightly turned over: the reading of the\nscripture ought to be a temperate and premeditated act, and to which men\nshould always add this devout preface, \u2018sursum corda\u2019, preparing even the\nbody to so humble and composed a gesture and countenance as shall\nevidence a particular veneration and attention.  Neither is it a book for\neveryone to fist, but the study of select men set apart for that purpose,\nand whom Almighty God has been pleased to call to that office and sacred\nfunction: the wicked and ignorant grow worse by it.  \u2018Tis, not a story to\ntell, but a history to revere, fear, and adore.  Are not they then\npleasant men who think they have rendered this fit for the people\u2019s\nhandling by translating it into the vulgar tongue?  Does the\nunderstanding of all therein contained only stick at words?  Shall I\nventure to say further, that by coming so near to understand a little,\nthey are much wider of the whole scope than before.  A pure and simple\nignorance and wholly depending upon the exposition of qualified persons,\nwas far more learned and salutary than this vain and verbal knowledge,\nwhich has only temerity and presumption.\n\nAnd I do further believe that the liberty every one has taken to disperse\nthe sacred writ into so many idioms carries with it a great deal more of\ndanger than utility.  The Jews, Mohammedans, and almost all other\npeoples, have reverentially espoused the language wherein their mysteries\nwere first conceived, and have expressly, and not without colour of\nreason, forbidden the alteration of them into any other.  Are we assured\nthat in Biscay and in Brittany there are enough competent judges of this\naffair to establish this translation into their own language?  The\nuniversal Church has not a more difficult and solemn judgment to make.\nIn preaching and speaking the interpretation is vague, free, mutable, and\nof a piece by itself; so \u2018tis not the same thing.\n\nOne of our Greek historians age justly censures the he lived in, because\nthe secrets of the Christian religion were dispersed into the hands of\nevery mechanic, to expound and argue upon, according to his own fancy,\nand that we ought to be much ashamed, we who by God\u2019s especial favour\nenjoy the pure mysteries of piety, to suffer them to be profaned by the\nignorant rabble; considering that the Gentiles expressly forbad Socrates,\nPlato, and the other sages to inquire into or so much as mention the\nthings committed to the priests of Delphi; and he says, moreover, that\nthe factions of princes upon theological subjects are armed not with zeal\nbut fury; that zeal springs from the divine wisdom and justice, and\ngoverns itself with prudence and moderation, but degenerates into hatred\nand envy, producing tares and nettles instead of corn and wine when\nconducted by human passions.  And it was truly said by another, who,\nadvising the Emperor Theodosius, told him that disputes did not so much\nrock the schisms of the Church asleep, as it roused and animated\nheresies; that, therefore, all contentions and dialectic disputations\nwere to be avoided, and men absolutely to acquiesce in the prescriptions\nand formulas of faith established by the ancients.  And the Emperor\nAndronicus having overheard some great men at high words in his palace\nwith Lapodius about a point of ours of great importance, gave them so\nsevere a check as to threaten to cause them to be thrown into the river\nif they did not desist.  The very women and children nowadays take upon\nthem to lecture the oldest and most experienced men about the\necclesiastical laws; whereas the first of those of Plato forbids them to\ninquire so much as into the civil laws, which were to stand instead of\ndivine ordinances; and, allowing the old men to confer amongst themselves\nor with the magistrate about those things, he adds, provided it be not in\nthe presence of young or profane persons.\n\nA bishop has left in writing that at the other end of the world there is\nan isle, by the ancients called Dioscorides, abundantly fertile in all\nsorts of trees and fruits, and of an exceedingly healthful air; the\ninhabitants of which are Christians, having churches and altars, only\nadorned with crosses without any other images, great observers of fasts\nand feasts, exact payers of their tithes to the priests, and so chaste,\nthat none of them is permitted to have to do with more than one woman in\nhis life--[What Osorius says is that these people only had one wife at a\ntime.]--as to the rest, so content with their condition, that environed\nwith the sea they know nothing of navigation, and so simple that they\nunderstand not one syllable of the religion they profess and wherein they\nare so devout: a thing incredible to such as do not know that the Pagans,\nwho are so zealous idolaters, know nothing more of their gods than their\nbare names and their statues.  The ancient beginning of \u2018Menalippus\u2019, a\ntragedy of Euripides, ran thus:\n\n               \u201cO Jupiter!  for that name alone\n               Of what thou art to me is known.\u201d\n\nI have also known in my time some men\u2019s writings found fault with for\nbeing purely human and philosophical, without any mixture of theology;\nand yet, with some show of reason, it might, on the contrary, be said\nthat the divine doctrine, as queen and regent of the rest, better keeps\nher state apart, that she ought to be sovereign throughout, not\nsubsidiary and suffragan, and that, peradventure, grammatical,\nrhetorical, logical examples may elsewhere be more suitably chosen, as\nalso the material for the stage, games, and public entertainments, than\nfrom so sacred a matter; that divine reasons are considered with greater\nveneration and attention by themselves, and in their own proper style,\nthan when mixed with and adapted to human discourse; that it is a fault\nmuch more often observed that the divines write too humanly, than that\nthe humanists write not theologically enough.  Philosophy, says St.\nChrysostom, has long been banished the holy schools, as an handmaid\naltogether useless and thought unworthy to look, so much as in passing\nby the door, into the sanctuary of the holy treasures of the celestial\ndoctrine; that the human way of speaking is of a much lower form and\nought not to adopt for herself the dignity and majesty of divine\neloquence.  Let who will \u2018verbis indisciplinatis\u2019 talk of fortune,\ndestiny, accident, good and evil hap, and other suchlike phrases,\naccording to his own humour; I for my part propose fancies merely human\nand merely my own, and that simply as human fancies, and separately\nconsidered, not as determined by any decree from heaven, incapable of\ndoubt or dispute; matter of opinion, not matter of faith; things which I\ndiscourse of according to my own notions, not as I believe, according to\nGod; after a laical, not clerical, and yet always after a very religious\nmanner, as children prepare their exercises, not to instruct but to be\ninstructed.\n\nAnd might it not be said, that an edict enjoining all people but such as\nare public professors of divinity, to be very reserved in writing of\nreligion, would carry with it a very good colour of utility and justice\n--and to me, amongst the rest peradventure, to hold my prating?  I have\nbeen told that even those who are not of our Church nevertheless amongst\nthemselves expressly forbid the name of God to be used in common\ndiscourse, nor so much even by way of interjection, exclamation,\nassertion of a truth, or comparison; and I think them in the right: upon\nwhat occasion soever we call upon God to accompany and assist us, it\nought always to be done with the greatest reverence and devotion.\n\nThere is, as I remember, a passage in Xenophon where he tells us that we\nought so much the more seldom to call upon God, by how much it is hard to\ncompose our souls to such a degree of calmness, patience, and devotion as\nit ought to be in at such a time; otherwise our prayers are not only vain\nand fruitless, but vicious: \u201cforgive us,\u201d we say, \u201cour trespasses, as we\nforgive them that trespass against us\u201d; what do we mean by this petition\nbut that we present to God a soul free from all rancour and revenge?  And\nyet we make nothing of invoking God\u2019s assistance in our vices, and\ninviting Him into our unjust designs:\n\n          \u201cQuae, nisi seductis, nequeas committere divis\u201d\n\n     [\u201cWhich you can only impart to the gods, when you have gained them\n     over.\u201d--Persius, ii. 4.]\n\nthe covetous man prays for the conservation of his vain and superfluous\nriches; the ambitious for victory and the good conduct of his fortune;\nthe thief calls Him to his assistance, to deliver him from the dangers\nand difficulties that obstruct his wicked designs, or returns Him thanks\nfor the facility he has met with in cutting a man\u2019s throat; at the door\nof the house men are going to storm or break into by force of a petard,\nthey fall to prayers for success, their intentions and hopes of cruelty,\navarice, and lust.\n\n         \u201cHoc igitur, quo to Jovis aurem impellere tentas,\n          Dic agedum Staio: \u2018proh Jupiter!  O bone, clamet,\n          Jupiter!\u2019  At sese non clamet Jupiter ipse.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThis therefore, with which you seek to draw the ear of Jupiter,\n     say to Staius.  \u2018O Jupiter!  O good Jupiter!\u2019 let him cry.  Think\n     you Jupiter himself would not cry out upon it?\u201d--Persius, ii. 21.]\n\nMarguerite, Queen of Navarre,--[In the Heptameron.]--tells of a young\nprince, who, though she does not name him, is easily enough by his great\nqualities to be known, who going upon an amorous assignation to lie with\nan advocate\u2019s wife of Paris, his way thither being through a church, he\nnever passed that holy place going to or returning from his pious\nexercise, but he always kneeled down to pray.  Wherein he would employ\nthe divine favour, his soul being full of such virtuous meditations,\nI leave others to judge, which, nevertheless, she instances for a\ntestimony of singular devotion.  But this is not the only proof we have\nthat women are not very fit to treat of theological affairs.\n\nA true prayer and religious reconciling of ourselves to Almighty God\ncannot enter into an impure soul, subject at the very time to the\ndominion of Satan.  He who calls God to his assistance whilst in a course\nof vice, does as if a cut-purse should call a magistrate to help him, or\nlike those who introduce the name of God to the attestation of a lie.\n\n                         \u201cTacito mala vota susurro\n                    Concipimus.\u201d\n\n          [\u201cWe whisper our guilty prayers.\u201d---Lucan, v. 104.]\n\nThere are few men who durst publish to the world the prayers they make to\nAlmighty God:\n\n         \u201cHaud cuivis promptum est, murmurque, humilesque susurros\n          Tollere de templis, et aperto vivere voto\u201d\n\n     [\u201c\u2018Tis not convenient for every one to bring the prayers he mutters\n     out of the temple, and to give his wishes to the public ear.\n     --\u201cPersius, ii. 6.]\n\nand this is the reason why the Pythagoreans would have them always public\nand heard by every one, to the end they might not prefer indecent or\nunjust petitions as this man:\n\n              \u201cClare quum dixit, Apollo!\n               Labra movet, metuens audiri: Pulcra Laverna,\n               Da mihi fallere, da justum sanctumque videri;\n               Noctem peccatis, et fraudibus objice nubem.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cWhen he has clearly said Apollo!  he moves his lips, fearful to be\n     heard; he murmurs: O fair Laverna, grant me the talent to deceive;\n     grant me to appear holy and just; shroud my sins with night, and\n     cast a cloud over my frauds.\u201d--Horace, Ep., i.  16, 59.--(Laverna\n     was the goddess of thieves.)]\n\nThe gods severely punished the wicked prayers of OEdipus in granting\nthem: he had prayed that his children might amongst themselves determine\nthe succession to his throne by arms, and was so miserable as to see\nhimself taken at his word.  We are not to pray that all things may go as\nwe would have them, but as most concurrent with prudence.\n\nWe seem, in truth, to make use of our prayers as of a kind of jargon, and\nas those do who employ holy words about sorceries and magical operations;\nand as if we reckoned the benefit we are to reap from them as depending\nupon the contexture, sound, and jingle of words, or upon the grave\ncomposing of the countenance.  For having the soul contaminated with\nconcupiscence, not touched with repentance, or comforted by any late\nreconciliation with God, we go to present Him such words as the memory\nsuggests to the tongue, and hope from thence to obtain the remission of\nour sins.  There is nothing so easy, so sweet, and so favourable, as the\ndivine law: it calls and invites us to her, guilty and abominable as we\nare; extends her arms and receives us into her bosom, foul and polluted\nas we at present are, and are for the future to be.  But then, in return,\nwe are to look upon her with a respectful eye; we are to receive this\npardon with all gratitude and submission, and for that instant at least,\nwherein we address ourselves to her, to have the soul sensible of the\nills we have committed, and at enmity with those passions that seduced us\nto offend her; neither the gods nor good men (says Plato) will accept the\npresent of a wicked man:\n\n                   \u201cImmunis aram si terigit manus,\n                    Non sumptuosa blandior hostia\n                    Mollivit aversos Penates\n                    Farre pio et saliente mica.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cIf a pure hand has touched the altar, the pious offering of a\n     small cake and a few grains of salt will appease the offended gods\n     more effectually than costly sacrifices.\u201d\n      --Horace, Od., iii. 23, 17.]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER LVII\n\nOF AGE\n\nI cannot allow of the way in which we settle for ourselves the duration\nof our life.  I see that the sages contract it very much in comparison of\nthe common opinion: \u201cwhat,\u201d said the younger Cato to those who would stay\nhis hand from killing himself, \u201cam I now of an age to be reproached that\nI go out of the world too soon?\u201d  And yet he was but eight-and-forty\nyears old.  He thought that to be a mature and advanced age, considering\nhow few arrive unto it.  And such as, soothing their thoughts with I know\nnot what course of nature, promise to themselves some years beyond it,\ncould they be privileged from the infinite number of accidents to which\nwe are by a natural subjection exposed, they might have some reason so to\ndo.  What am idle conceit is it to expect to die of a decay of strength,\nwhich is the effect of extremest age, and to propose to ourselves no\nshorter lease of life than that, considering it is a kind of death of all\nothers the most rare and very seldom seen?  We call that only a natural\ndeath; as if it were contrary to nature to see a man break his neck with\na fall, be drowned in shipwreck, be snatched away with a pleurisy or the\nplague, and as if our ordinary condition did not expose us to these\ninconveniences.  Let us no longer flatter ourselves with these fine\nwords; we ought rather, peradventure, to call that natural which is\ngeneral, common, and universal.\n\nTo die of old age is a death rare, extraordinary, and singular, and,\ntherefore, so much less natural than the others; \u2018tis the last and\nextremest sort of dying: and the more remote, the less to be hoped for.\nIt is, indeed, the bourn beyond which we are not to pass, and which the\nlaw of nature has set as a limit, not to be exceeded; but it is, withal,\na privilege she is rarely seen to give us to last till then.  \u2018Tis a\nlease she only signs by particular favour, and it may be to one only in\nthe space of two or three ages, and then with a pass to boot, to carry\nhim through all the traverses and difficulties she has strewed in the way\nof this long career.  And therefore my opinion is, that when once forty\nyears we should consider it as an age to which very few arrive.  For\nseeing that men do not usually proceed so far, it is a sign that we are\npretty well advanced; and since we have exceeded the ordinary bounds,\nwhich is the just measure of life, we ought not to expect to go much\nfurther; having escaped so many precipices of death, whereinto we have\nseen so many other men fall, we should acknowledge that so extraordinary\na fortune as that which has hitherto rescued us from those eminent\nperils, and kept us alive beyond the ordinary term of living, is not like\nto continue long.\n\n\u2018Tis a fault in our very laws to maintain this error: these say that a\nman is not capable of managing his own estate till he be five-and-twenty\nyears old, whereas he will have much ado to manage his life so long.\nAugustus cut off five years from the ancient Roman standard, and declared\nthat thirty years old was sufficient for a judge.  Servius Tullius\nsuperseded the knights of above seven-and-forty years of age from the\nfatigues of war; Augustus dismissed them at forty-five; though methinks\nit seems a little unreasonable that men should be sent to the fireside\ntill five-and-fifty or sixty years of age.  I should be of opinion that\nour vocation and employment should be as far as possible extended for the\npublic good: I find the fault on the other side, that they do not employ\nus early enough.  This emperor was arbiter of the whole world at\nnineteen, and yet would have a man to be thirty before he could be fit to\ndetermine a dispute about a gutter.\n\nFor my part, I believe our souls are adult at twenty as much as they are\never like to be, and as capable then as ever.  A soul that has not by\nthat time given evident earnest of its force and virtue will never after\ncome to proof.  The natural qualities and virtues produce what they have\nof vigorous and fine, within that term or never,\n\n                   \u201cSi l\u2019espine rion picque quand nai,\n                    A pene que picque jamai,\u201d\n\n               [\u201cIf the thorn does not prick at its birth,\n               \u2018twill hardly ever prick at all.\u201d]\n\nas they say in Dauphin.\n\nOf all the great human actions I ever heard or read of, of what sort\nsoever, I have observed, both in former ages and our own, more were\nperformed before the age of thirty than after; and this ofttimes in the\nvery lives of the same men.  May I not confidently instance in those of\nHannibal and his great rival Scipio?  The better half of their lives they\nlived upon the glory they had acquired in their youth; great men after,\n\u2018tis true, in comparison of others; but by no means in comparison of\nthemselves.  As to my own particular, I do certainly believe that since\nthat age, both my understanding and my constitution have rather decayed\nthan improved, and retired rather than advanced.  \u2018Tis possible, that\nwith those who make the best use of their time, knowledge and experience\nmay increase with their years; but vivacity, promptitude, steadiness, and\nother pieces of us, of much greater importance, and much more essentially\nour own, languish and decay:\n\n              \u201cUbi jam validis quassatum est viribus aevi\n               Corpus, et obtusis ceciderunt viribus artus,\n               Claudicat ingenium, delirat linguaque, mensque.\u201d\n\n          [\u201cWhen once the body is shaken by the violence of time,\n          blood and vigour ebbing away, the judgment halts,\n          the tongue and the mind dote.\u201d--Lucretius, iii. 452.]\n\nSometimes the body first submits to age, sometimes the mind; and I have\nseen enough who have got a weakness in their brains before either in\ntheir legs or stomach; and by how much the more it is a disease of no\ngreat pain to the sufferer, and of obscure symptoms, so much greater is\nthe danger.  For this reason it is that I complain of our laws, not that\nthey keep us too long to our work, but that they set us to work too late.\nFor the frailty of life considered, and to how many ordinary and natural\nrocks it is exposed, one ought not to give up so large a portion of it to\nchildhood, idleness, and apprenticeship.\n\n     [Which Cotton thus renders: \u201cBirth though noble, ought not to share\n     so large a vacancy, and so tedious a course of education.\u201d  Florio\n     (1613) makes the passage read as-follows: \u201cMethinks that,\n     considering the weakness of our life, and seeing the infinite number\n     of ordinary rocks and natural dangers it is subject unto, we should\n     not, so soon as we come into the world, allot so large a share\n     thereof unto unprofitable wantonness in youth, ill-breeding\n     idleness, and slow-learning prentisage.\u201d]\n\n\n\n\n     ETEXT EDITOR\u2019S BOOKMARKS:\n\n     Advise to choose weapons of the shortest sort\n     An ignorance that knowledge creates and begets\n     Ashamed to lay out as much thought and study upon it\n     Can neither keep nor enjoy anything with a good grace\n     Change of fashions\n     Chess: this idle and childish game\n     Death is terrible to Cicero, coveted by Cato\n     Death of old age the most rare and very seldom seen\n     Diogenes, esteeming us no better than flies or bladders\n     Do not to pray that all things may go as we would have them\n     Excel above the common rate in frivolous things\n     Expresses more contempt and condemnation than the other\n     Fancy that others cannot believe otherwise than as he does\n     Gradations above and below pleasure\n     Greatest apprehensions, from things unseen, concealed\n     He did not think mankind worthy of a wise man\u2019s concern\n     Home anxieties and a mind enslaved by wearing complaints\n     How infirm and decaying material this fabric of ours is\n     I do not willingly alight when I am once on horseback\n     Led by the ears by this charming harmony of words\n     Little knacks  and frivolous subtleties\n     Men approve of things for their being rare and new\n     Must of necessity walk in the steps of another\n     Natural death the most rare and very seldom seen\n     Not to instruct but to be instructed.\n     Present Him such words as the memory suggests to the tongue\n     Psalms of King David: promiscuous, indiscreet\n     Rhetoric: an art to flatter and deceive\n     Rhetoric: to govern a disorderly and tumultuous rabble\n     Sitting betwixt two stools\n     Sometimes the body first submits to age, sometimes the mind\n     Stupidity and facility natural to the common people\n     The Bible: the wicked and ignorant grow worse by it.\n     The faintness that surprises in the exercises of Venus\n     Thucydides: which was the better wrestler\n     To die of old age is a death rare, extraordinary, and singular\n     To make little things appear great was his profession\n     To smell, though well, is to stink\n     Valour will cause a trembling in the limbs as well as fear\n     Viscid melting kisses of youthful ardour in my wanton age\n     We can never be despised according to our full desert\n     When we have got it, we want something else\n     Women who paint, pounce, and plaster up their ruins\n\n\n\n\n\n\nESSAYS OF MICHEL DE MONTAIGNE\n\nTranslated by Charles Cotton\n\nEdited by William Carew Hazlitt\n\n1877\n\n\n\nCONTENTS OF VOLUME 9.\n\nI.

We find the younger\nMarius one while a son of Mars and another a son of Venus.  Pope Boniface\nVIII. entered, it is said, into his Papacy like a fox, behaved himself in\nit like a lion, and died like a dog; and who could believe it to be the\nsame Nero, the perfect image of all cruelty, who, having the sentence of\na condemned man brought to him to sign, as was the custom, cried out,\n\u201cO that I had never been taught to write!\u201d so much it went to his heart\nto condemn a man to death.  All story is full of such examples, and every\nman is able to produce so many to himself, or out of his own practice or\nobservation, that I sometimes wonder to see men of understanding give\nthemselves the trouble of sorting these pieces, considering that\nirresolution appears to me to be the most common and manifest vice of our\nnature witness the famous verse of the player Publius:\n\n          \u201cMalum consilium est, quod mutari non potest.\u201d\n\n          [\u201c\u2018Tis evil counsel that will admit no change.\u201d\n           --Pub.  Mim., ex Aul. Gell., xvii. 14.]\n\nThere seems some reason in forming a judgment of a man from the most\nusual methods of his life; but, considering the natural instability of\nour manners and opinions, I have often thought even the best authors a\nlittle out in so obstinately endeavouring to make of us any constant and\nsolid contexture; they choose a general air of a man, and according to\nthat interpret all his actions, of which, if they cannot bend some to a\nuniformity with the rest, they are presently imputed to dissimulation.\nAugustus has escaped them, for there was in him so apparent, sudden, and\ncontinual variety of actions all the whole course of his life, that he\nhas slipped away clear and undecided from the most daring critics.  I can\nmore hardly believe a man\u2019s constancy than any other virtue, and believe\nnothing sooner than the contrary.  He that would judge of a man in detail\nand distinctly, bit by bit, would oftener be able to speak the truth.  It\nis a hard matter, from all antiquity, to pick out a dozen men who have\nformed their lives to one certain and constant course, which is the\nprincipal design of wisdom; for to comprise it all in one word, says one\nof the ancients, and to contract all the rules of human life into one,\n\u201cit is to will, and not to will, always one and the same thing: I will\nnot vouchsafe,\u201d says he, \u201cto add, provided the will be just, for if it be\nnot just, it is impossible it should be always one.\u201d  I have indeed\nformerly learned that vice is nothing but irregularity, and want of\nmeasure, and therefore \u2018tis impossible to fix constancy to it.  \u2018Tis a\nsaying of.  Demosthenes, \u201cthat the beginning oh all virtue is\nconsultation and deliberation; the end and perfection, constancy.\u201d  If we\nwould resolve on any certain course by reason, we should pitch upon the\nbest, but nobody has thought on\u2019t:\n\n          \u201cQuod petit, spernit; repetit, quod nuper omisit;\n          AEstuat, et vitae disconvenit ordine toto.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThat which he sought he despises; what he lately lost, he seeks\n     again.  He fluctuates, and is inconsistent in the whole order of\n     life.\u201d--Horace, Ep., i. I, 98.]\n\nOur ordinary practice is to follow the inclinations of our appetite, be\nit to the left or right, upwards or downwards, according as we are wafted\nby the breath of occasion.  We never meditate what we would have till the\ninstant we have a mind to have it; and change like that little creature\nwhich receives its colour from what it is laid upon.  What we but just\nnow proposed to ourselves we immediately alter, and presently return\nagain to it; \u2018tis nothing but shifting and inconsistency:\n\n               \u201cDucimur, ut nervis alienis mobile lignum.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cWe are turned about like the top with the thong of others.\u201d\n      --Idem, Sat., ii. 7, 82.]\n\nWe do not go, we are driven; like things that float, now leisurely, then\nwith violence, according to the gentleness or rapidity of the current:\n\n                         \u201cNonne videmus,\n          Quid sibi quisque velit, nescire, et quaerere semper\n          Commutare locum, quasi onus deponere possit?\u201d\n\n     [\u201cDo we not see them, uncertain what they want, and always asking\n     for something new, as if they could get rid of the burthen.\u201d\n      --Lucretius, iii. 1070.]\n\nEvery day a new whimsy, and our humours keep motion with the time.\n\n         \u201cTales sunt hominum mentes, quali pater ipse\n          Juppiter auctificas lustravit lumine terras.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cSuch are the minds of men, that they change as the light with\n     which father Jupiter himself has illumined the increasing earth.\u201d\n      --Cicero, Frag.  Poet, lib. x.]\n\nWe fluctuate betwixt various inclinations; we will nothing freely,\nnothing absolutely, nothing constantly.  In any one who had prescribed\nand established determinate laws and rules in his head for his own\nconduct, we should perceive an equality of manners, an order and an\ninfallible relation of one thing or action to another, shine through his\nwhole life; Empedocles observed this discrepancy in the Agrigentines,\nthat they gave themselves up to delights, as if every day was their last,\nand built as if they had been to live for ever.  The judgment would not\nbe hard to make, as is very evident in the younger Cato; he who therein\nhas found one step, it will lead him to all the rest; \u2018tis a harmony of\nvery according sounds, that cannot jar.  But with us \u2018t is quite\ncontrary; every particular action requires a particular judgment.  The\nsurest way to steer, in my opinion, would be to take our measures from\nthe nearest allied circumstances, without engaging in a longer\ninquisition, or without concluding any other consequence.  I was told,\nduring the civil disorders of our poor kingdom, that a maid, hard by the\nplace where I then was, had thrown herself out of a window to avoid being\nforced by a common soldier who was quartered in the house; she was not\nkilled by the fall, and therefore, repeating her attempt would have cut\nher own throat, had she not been prevented; but having, nevertheless,\nwounded herself to some show of danger, she voluntarily confessed that\nthe soldier had not as yet importuned her otherwise; than by courtship,\nearnest solicitation, and presents; but that she was afraid that in the\nend he would have proceeded to violence, all which she delivered with\nsuch a countenance and accent, and withal embrued in her own blood, the\nhighest testimony of her virtue, that she appeared another Lucretia; and\nyet I have since been very well assured that both before and after she\nwas not so difficult a piece.  And, according to my host\u2019s tale in\nAriosto, be as handsome a man and as worthy a gentleman as you will, do\nnot conclude too much upon your mistress\u2019s inviolable chastity for having\nbeen repulsed; you do not know but she may have a better stomach to your\nmuleteer.\n\nAntigonus, having taken one of his soldiers into a great degree of favour\nand esteem for his valour, gave his physicians strict charge to cure him\nof a long and inward disease under which he had a great while languished,\nand observing that, after his cure, he went much more coldly to work than\nbefore, he asked him what had so altered and cowed him: \u201cYourself, sir,\u201d\n replied the other, \u201cby having eased me of the pains that made me weary of\nmy life.\u201d  Lucullus\u2019s soldier having been rifled by the enemy, performed\nupon them in revenge a brave exploit, by which having made himself a\ngainer, Lucullus, who had conceived a good opinion of him from that\naction, went about to engage him in some enterprise of very great danger,\nwith all the plausible persuasions and promises he could think of;\n\n          \u201cVerbis, quae timido quoque possent addere mentem\u201d\n\n          [\u201cWords which might add courage to any timid man.\u201d\n           --Horace, Ep., ii. 2, 1, 2.]\n\n\u201cPray employ,\u201d answered he, \u201csome miserable plundered soldier in that\naffair\u201d:\n\n                         \u201cQuantumvis rusticus, ibit,\n               Ibit eo, quo vis, qui zonam perdidit, inquit;\u201d\n\n     [\u201cSome poor fellow, who has lost his purse, will go whither you\n     wish, said he.\u201d--Horace, Ep., ii. 2, 39.]\n\nand flatly refused to go.  When we read that Mahomet having furiously\nrated Chasan, Bassa of the Janissaries, because he had seen the\nHungarians break into his squadrons, and himself behave very ill in the\nbusiness, and that Chasan, instead of any other answer, rushed furiously\nalone, scimitar in hand, into the first body of the enemy, where he was\npresently cut to pieces, we are not to look upon that action,\nperadventure, so much as vindication as a turn of mind, not so much\nnatural valour as a sudden despite.  The man you saw yesterday so\nadventurous and brave, you must not think it strange to see him as great\na poltroon the next: anger, necessity, company, wine, or the sound of the\ntrumpet had roused his spirits; this is no valour formed and established\nby reason, but accidentally created by such circumstances, and therefore\nit is no wonder if by contrary circumstances it appear quite another\nthing.\n\nThese supple variations and contradictions so manifest in us, have given\noccasion to some to believe that man has two souls; other two distinct\npowers that always accompany and incline us, the one towards good and the\nother towards ill, according to their own nature and propension; so\nabrupt a variety not being imaginable to flow from one and the same\nsource.\n\nFor my part, the puff of every accident not only carries me along with it\naccording to its own proclivity, but moreover I discompose and trouble\nmyself by the instability of my own posture; and whoever will look\nnarrowly into his own bosom, will hardly find himself twice in the same\ncondition.  I give to my soul sometimes one face and sometimes another,\naccording to the side I turn her to.  If I speak variously of myself, it\nis because I consider myself variously; all the contrarieties are there\nto be found in one corner or another; after one fashion or another:\nbashful, insolent; chaste, lustful; prating, silent; laborious, delicate;\ningenious, heavy; melancholic, pleasant; lying, true; knowing, ignorant;\nliberal, covetous, and prodigal: I find all this in myself, more or less,\naccording as I turn myself about; and whoever will sift himself to the\nbottom, will find in himself, and even in his own judgment, this\nvolubility and discordance.  I have nothing to say of myself entirely,\nsimply, and solidly without mixture and confusion.  \u2018Distinguo\u2019 is the\nmost universal member of my logic.  Though I always intend to speak well\nof good things, and rather to interpret such things as fall out in the\nbest sense than otherwise, yet such is the strangeness of our condition,\nthat we are often pushed on to do well even by vice itself, if well-doing\nwere not judged by the intention only.  One gallant action, therefore,\nought not to conclude a man valiant; if a man were brave indeed, he would\nbe always so, and upon all occasions.  If it were a habit of valour and\nnot a sally, it would render a man equally resolute in all accidents; the\nsame alone as in company; the same in lists as in a battle: for, let them\nsay what they will, there is not one valour for the pavement and another\nfor the field; he would bear a sickness in his bed as bravely as a wound\nin the field, and no more fear death in his own house than at an assault.\nWe should not then see the same man charge into a breach with a brave\nassurance, and afterwards torment himself like a woman for the loss of a\ntrial at law or the death of a child; when, being an infamous coward, he\nis firm in the necessities of poverty; when he shrinks at the sight of a\nbarber\u2019s razor, and rushes fearless upon the swords of the enemy, the\naction is commendable, not the man.\n\nMany of the Greeks, says Cicero,--[Cicero, Tusc. Quaes., ii. 27.]--\ncannot endure the sight of an enemy, and yet are courageous in sickness;\nthe Cimbrians and Celtiberians quite contrary;\n\n              \u201cNihil enim potest esse aequabile,\n               quod non a certa ratione proficiscatur.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cNothing can be regular that does not proceed from a fixed ground\n     of reason.\u201d--Idem, ibid., c. 26.]\n\nNo valour can be more extreme in its kind than that of Alexander: but it\nis of but one kind, nor full enough throughout, nor universal.\nIncomparable as it is, it has yet some blemishes; of which his being so\noften at his wits\u2019 end upon every light suspicion of his captains\nconspiring against his life, and the carrying himself in that inquisition\nwith so much vehemence and indiscreet injustice, and with a fear that\nsubverted his natural reason, is one pregnant instance.  The\nsuperstition, also, with which he was so much tainted, carries along with\nit some image of pusillanimity; and the excess of his penitence for the\nmurder of Clytus is also a testimony of the unevenness of his courage.\nAll we perform is no other than a cento, as a man may say, of several\npieces, and we would acquire honour by a false title.  Virtue cannot be\nfollowed but for herself, and if one sometimes borrows her mask to some\nother purpose, she presently pulls it away again.  \u2018Tis a vivid and\nstrong tincture which, when the soul has once thoroughly imbibed it, will\nnot out but with the piece.  And, therefore, to make a right judgment of\na man, we are long and very observingly to follow his trace: if constancy\ndoes not there stand firm upon her own proper base,\n\n               \u201cCui vivendi via considerata atque provisa est,\u201d\n\n     [\u201cIf the way of his life is thoroughly considered and traced out.\u201d\n      --Cicero, Paradox, v. 1.]\n\nif the variety of occurrences makes him alter his pace (his path, I mean,\nfor the pace may be faster or slower) let him go; such an one runs before\nthe wind, \u201cAvau le dent,\u201d as the motto of our Talebot has it.\n\n\u2018Tis no wonder, says one of the ancients, that chance has so great a\ndominion over us, since it is by chance we live.  It is not possible for\nany one who has not designed his life for some certain end, it is\nimpossible for any one to arrange the pieces, who has not the whole form\nalready contrived in his imagination.  Of what use are colours to him\nthat knows not what he is to paint?  No one lays down a certain design\nfor his life, and we only deliberate thereof by pieces.  The archer ought\nfirst to know at what he is to aim, and then accommodate his arm, bow,\nstring, shaft, and motion to it; our counsels deviate and wander, because\nnot levelled to any determinate end.  No wind serves him who addresses\nhis voyage to no certain, port.  I cannot acquiesce in the judgment given\nby one in the behalf of Sophocles,  who concluded him capable of the\nmanagement of domestic affairs, against the accusation of his son, from\nhaving read one of his tragedies.\n\nNeither do I allow of the conjecture of the Parians, sent to regulate the\nMilesians sufficient for such a consequence as they from thence derived\ncoming to visit the island, they took notice of such grounds as were best\nhusbanded, and such country-houses as were best governed; and having\ntaken the names of the owners, when they had assembled the citizens, they\nappointed these farmers for new governors and magistrates; concluding\nthat they, who had been so provident in their own private concerns, would\nbe so of the public too.  We are all lumps, and of so various and inform\na contexture, that every piece plays, every moment, its own game, and\nthere is as much difference betwixt us and ourselves as betwixt us and\nothers:\n\n               \u201cMagnam rem puta, unum hominem agere.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cEsteem it a great thing always to act as one and the same\n     man.\u201d--Seneca, Ep., 150.]\n\nSince ambition can teach man valour, temperance, and liberality, and even\njustice too; seeing that avarice can inspire the courage of a shop-boy,\nbred and nursed up in obscurity and ease, with the assurance to expose\nhimself so far from the fireside to the mercy of the waves and angry\nNeptune in a frail boat; that she further teaches discretion and\nprudence; and that even Venus can inflate boys under the discipline of\nthe rod with boldness and resolution, and infuse masculine courage into\nthe heart of tender virgins in their mothers\u2019 arms:\n\n         \u201cHac duce, custodes furtim transgressa jacentes,\n          Ad juvenem tenebris sola puella venit:\u201d\n\n     [\u201cShe leading, the maiden, furtively passing by the recumbent\n     guards, goes alone in the darkness to the youth.\u201d\n      --Tibullus, ii. 2, 75.]\n\n\u2018tis not all the understanding has to do, simply to judge us by our\noutward actions; it must penetrate the very soul, and there discover by\nwhat springs the motion is guided.  But that being a high and hazardous\nundertaking, I could wish that fewer would attempt it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nOF DRUNKENNESS\n\nThe world is nothing but variety and disemblance, vices are all alike, as\nthey are vices, and peradventure the Stoics understand them so; but\nalthough they are equally vices, yet they are not all equal vices; and he\nwho has transgressed the ordinary bounds a hundred paces:\n\n          \u201cQuos ultra citraque nequit consistere rectum,\u201d\n\n          [\u201cBeyond or within which the right cannot exist.\u201d\n           --Horace, Sat., i, 1, 107.]\n\nshould not be in a worse condition than he that has advanced but ten, is\nnot to be believed; or that sacrilege is not worse than stealing a\ncabbage:\n\n         \u201cNec vincet ratio hoc, tantumdem ut peccet, idemque,\n          Qui teneros caules alieni fregerit horti,\n          Et qui nocturnus divum sacra legerit.\u201d\n\nThere is in this as great diversity as in anything whatever.  The\nconfounding of the order and measure of sins is dangerous: murderers,\ntraitors, and tyrants get too much by it, and it is not reasonable they\nshould flatter their consciences, because another man is idle,\nlascivious, or not assiduous at his devotion.  Every one overrates the\noffence of his companions, but extenuates his own.  Our very instructors\nthemselves rank them sometimes, in my opinion, very ill.  As Socrates\nsaid that the principal office of wisdom was to distinguish good from\nevil, we, the best of whom are vicious, ought also to say the same of the\nscience of distinguishing betwixt vice and vice, without which, and that\nvery exactly performed, the virtuous and the wicked will remain\nconfounded and unrecognised.\n\nNow, amongst the rest, drunkenness seems to me to be a gross and brutish\nvice.  The soul has greater part in the rest, and there are some vices\nthat have something, if a man may so say, of generous in them; there are\nvices wherein there is a mixture of knowledge, diligence, valour,\nprudence, dexterity, and address; this one is totally corporeal and\nearthly.  And the rudest nation this day in Europe is that alone where it\nis in fashion.  Other vices discompose the understanding: this totally\noverthrows it and renders the body stupid:\n\n              \u201cCum vini vis penetravit .  .  .\n               Consequitur gravitas membrorum, praepediuntur\n               Crura vacillanti, tardescit lingua, madet mens,\n               Nant oculi; clamor, singultus, jurgia, gliscunt.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cWhen the power of wine has penetrated us, a heaviness of the limbs\n     follows, the legs of the tottering person are impeded; the tongue\n     grows torpid, the mind is dimmed, the eyes swim; noise, hiccup, and\n     quarrels arise.--\u201cLucretius, i. 3, 475.]\n\nThe worst state of man is that wherein he loses the knowledge and\ngovernment of himself.  And \u2018tis said amongst other things upon this\nsubject, that, as the must fermenting in a vessel, works up to the top\nwhatever it has in the bottom, so wine, in those who have drunk beyond\nmeasure, vents the most inward secrets:\n\n                   \u201cTu sapientum\n                    Curas et arcanum jocoso\n                    Consilium retegis Lyaeo.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThou disclosest to the merry Lyacus the cares and secret\n     counsel of the wise.\u201d--Horace, Od., xxi. 1, 114.]\n\n     [Lyacus, a name given to Bacchus.]\n\nJosephus tells us that by giving an ambassador the enemy had sent to him\nhis full dose of liquor, he wormed out his secrets.  And yet, Augustus,\ncommitting the most inward secrets of his affairs to Lucius Piso, who\nconquered Thrace, never found him faulty in the least, no more than\nTiberias did Cossus, with whom he intrusted his whole counsels, though we\nknow they were both so given to drink that they have often been fain to\ncarry both the one and the other drunk out of the Senate:\n\n          \u201cHesterno inflatum venas ut semper, Lyaeo.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cTheir veins full, as usual, of yesterday\u2019s wine.\u201d\n      --Virgil, Egl., vi.  15.]\n\nAnd the design of killing Caesar was as safely communicated to Cimber,\nthough he would often be drunk, as to Cassius, who drank nothing but\nwater.\n\n     [As to which Cassius pleasantly said: \u201cWhat, shall I bear\n     a tyrant, I who cannot bear wine?\u201d]\n\nWe see our Germans, when drunk as the devil, know their post, remember\nthe word, and keep to their ranks:\n\n               \u201cNec facilis victoria de madidis, et\n               Blaesis, atque mero titubantibus.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cNor is a victory easily obtained over men so drunk, they can\n     scarce speak or stand.\u201d--Juvenal, Sat., xv.  47.]\n\nI could not have believed there had been so profound, senseless, and dead\na degree of drunkenness had I not read in history that Attalus having,\nto put a notable affront upon him, invited to supper the same Pausanias,\nwho upon the very same occasion afterwards killed Philip of Macedon,\na king who by his excellent qualities gave sufficient testimony of his\neducation in the house and company of Epaminondas, made him drink to such\na pitch that he could after abandon his beauty, as of a hedge strumpet,\nto the muleteers and servants of the basest office in the house.  And I\nhave been further told by a lady whom I highly honour and esteem, that\nnear Bordeaux and about Castres  where she lives, a country woman, a\nwidow of chaste repute, perceiving in herself the first symptoms of\nbreeding, innocently told her neighbours that if she had a husband she\nshould think herself with child; but the causes of suspicion every day\nmore and more increasing, and at last growing up to a manifest proof, the\npoor woman was reduced to the necessity of causing it to be proclaimed in\nher parish church, that whoever had done that deed and would frankly\nconfess it, she did not only promise to forgive, but moreover to marry\nhim, if he liked the motion; whereupon a young fellow that served her in\nthe quality of a labourer, encouraged by this proclamation, declared that\nhe had one holiday found her, having taken too much of the bottle, so\nfast asleep by the chimney and in so indecent a posture, that he could\nconveniently do his business without waking her; and they yet live\ntogether man and wife.\n\nIt is true that antiquity has not much decried this vice; the writings\neven of several philosophers speak very tenderly of it, and even amongst\nthe Stoics there are some who advise folks to give themselves sometimes\nthe liberty to drink, nay, to drunkenness, to refresh the soul:\n\n          \u201cHoc quoque virtutum quondam certamine, magnum\n          Socratem palmam promeruisse ferunt.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cIn this trial of power formerly they relate that the great\n     Socrates deserved the palm.\u201d--Cornet. Gallus, Ep., i. 47.]\n\nThat censor and reprover of others, Cato, was reproached that he was a\nhard drinker:\n\n                    \u201cNarratur et prisci Catonis\n                    Saepe mero caluisse virtus.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cAnd of old Cato it is said, that his courage was often warmed with\n     wine.\u201d--Horace, Od., xxi. 3, 11.--Cato the Elder.]\n\nCyrus, that so renowned king, amongst the other qualities by which he\nclaimed to be preferred before his brother Artaxerxes, urged this\nexcellence, that he could drink a great deal more than he.  And in the\nbest governed nations this trial of skill in drinking is very much in\nuse.  I have heard Silvius, an excellent physician of Paris, say that\nlest the digestive faculties of the stomach should grow idle, it were not\namiss once a month to rouse them by this excess, and to spur them lest\nthey should grow dull and rusty; and one author tells us that the\nPersians used to consult about their most important affairs after being\nwell warmed with wine.\n\nMy taste and constitution are greater enemies to this vice than my\ndiscourse; for besides that I easily submit my belief to the authority of\nancient opinions, I look upon it indeed as an unmanly and stupid vice,\nbut less malicious and hurtful than the others, which, almost all, more\ndirectly jostle public society.  And if we cannot please ourselves but it\nmust cost us something, as they hold, I find this vice costs a man\u2019s\nconscience less than the others, besides that it is of no difficult\npreparation, nor hard to be found, a consideration not altogether to be\ndespised.  A man well advanced both in dignity and age, amongst three\nprincipal commodities that he said remained to him of life, reckoned to\nme this for one, and where would a man more justly find it than amongst\nthe natural conveniences?  But he did not take it right, for delicacy and\nthe curious choice of wines is therein to be avoided.  If you found your\npleasure upon drinking of the best, you condemn yourself to the penance\nof drinking of the worst.  Your taste must be more indifferent and free;\nso delicate a palate is not required to make a good toper.  The Germans\ndrink almost indifferently of all wines with delight; their business is\nto pour down and not to taste; and it\u2019s so much the better for them:\ntheir pleasure is so much the more plentiful and nearer at hand.\n\nSecondly, to drink, after the French fashion, but at two meals, and then\nvery moderately, is to be too sparing of the favours of the god.  There\nis more time and constancy required than so.  The ancients spent whole\nnights in this exercise, and ofttimes added the day following to eke it\nout, and therefore we are to take greater liberty and stick closer to our\nwork.  I have seen a great lord of my time, a man of high enterprise and\nfamous success, that without setting himself to\u2019t, and after his ordinary\nrate of drinking at meals, drank not much less than five quarts of wine,\nand at his going away appeared but too wise and discreet, to the\ndetriment of our affairs.  The pleasure we hold in esteem for the course\nof our lives ought to have a greater share of our time dedicated to it;\nwe should, like shopboys and labourers, refuse no occasion nor omit any\nopportunity of drinking, and always have it in our minds.  Methinks we\nevery day abridge and curtail the use of wine, and that the after\nbreakfasts, dinner snatches, and collations I used to see in my father\u2019s\nhouse, when I was a boy, were more usual and frequent then than now.\n\nIs it that we pretend to a reformation?  Truly, no: but it may be we are\nmore addicted to Venus than our fathers were.  They are two exercises\nthat thwart and hinder one another in their vigour.  Lechery weakens our\nstomach on the one side; and on the other sobriety renders us more spruce\nand amorous for the exercise of love.\n\n\u2018Tis wonderful what strange stories I have heard my father tell of the\nchastity of that age wherein he lived.  It was for him to say it, being\nboth by art and nature cut out and finished for the service of ladies.\nHe spoke well and little: ever mixing his language with some illustration\nout of authors most in use, especially in Spanish, and among the Spanish\nhe whom they called Marcus Aurelius--[ Guevara\u2019s Golden Book of Marcus\nAurelius Antoninus.]--was ordinarily in his mouth.  His behaviour was\ngently grave, humble, and very modest; he was very solicitous of neatness\nand propriety both in his person and clothes, whether on horseback or\nafoot, he was monstrously punctual in his word; and of a conscience and\nreligion generally tending rather towards superstition than otherwise.\nFor a man of little stature, very strong, well proportioned, and well\nknit; of a pleasing countenance inclining to brown, and very adroit in\nall noble exercises.  I have yet in the house to be seen canes poured\nfull of lead, with which they say he exercised his arms for throwing the\nbar or the stone, or in fencing; and shoes with leaden soles to make him\nlighter for running or leaping.  Of his vaulting he has left little\nmiracles behind him: I have seen him when past three score laugh at our\nexercises, and throw himself in his furred gown into the saddle, make the\ntour of a table upon his thumbs and scarce ever mount the stairs into his\nchamber without taking three or four steps at a time.  But as to what I\nwas speaking of before; he said there was scarce one woman of quality of\nill fame in the whole province: he would tell of strange confidences, and\nsome of them his own, with virtuous women, free from any manner of\nsuspicion of ill, and for his own part solemnly swore he was a virgin at\nhis marriage; and yet it was after a long practice of arms beyond the\nmountains, of which wars he left us a journal under his own hand, wherein\nhe has given a precise account from point to point of all passages, both\nrelating to the public and to himself.  And he was, moreover, married at\na well advanced maturity, in the year 1528, the three-and-thirtieth year\nof his age, upon his way home from Italy.  But let us return to our\nbottles.\n\nThe incommodities of old age, that stand in need of some refreshment and\nsupport, might with reason beget in me a desire of this faculty, it being\nas it were the last pleasure the course of years deprives us of.  The\nnatural heat, say the good-fellows, first seats itself in the feet: that\nconcerns infancy; thence it mounts into the middle region, where it makes\na long abode and produces, in my opinion, the sole true pleasures of\nhuman life; all other pleasures in comparison sleep; towards the end,\nlike a vapour that still mounts upward, it arrives at the throat, where\nit makes its final residence, and concludes the progress.  I do not,\nnevertheless, understand how a man can extend the pleasure of drinking\nbeyond thirst, and forge in his imagination an appetite artificial and\nagainst nature; my stomach would not proceed so far; it has enough to do\nto deal with what it takes in for its necessity.  My constitution is not\nto care for drink but as following eating and washing down my meat, and\nfor that reason my last draught is always the greatest.  And seeing that\nin old age we have our palate furred with phlegms or depraved by some\nother ill constitution, the wine tastes better to us as the pores are\ncleaner washed and laid more open.  At least, I seldom taste the first\nglass well.  Anacharsis wondered that the Greeks drank in greater glasses\ntowards the end of a meal than at the beginning; which was, I suppose,\nfor the same reason the Germans do the same, who then begin the battle of\ndrink.\n\nPlato forbids children wine till eighteen years of age, and to get drunk\ntill forty; but, after forty, gives them leave to please themselves, and\nto mix a little liberally in their feasts the influence of Dionysos, that\ngood deity who restores to younger men their gaiety and to old men their\nyouth; who mollifies the passions of the soul, as iron is softened by\nfire; and in his Lazes allows such merry meetings, provided they have a\ndiscreet chief to govern and keep them in order, as good and of great\nutility; drunkenness being, he says, a true and certain trial of every\none\u2019s nature, and, withal, fit to inspire old men with mettle to divert\nthemselves in dancing and music; things of great use, and that they dare\nnot attempt when sober.  He, moreover, says that wine is able to supply\nthe soul with temperance and the body with health.  Nevertheless, these\nrestrictions, in part borrowed from the Carthaginians, please him: that\nmen forbear excesses in the expeditions of war; that every judge and\nmagistrate abstain from it when about the administrations of his place or\nthe consultations of the public affairs; that the day is not to be\nemployed with it, that being a time due to other occupations, nor the\nnight on which a man intends to get children.\n\n\u2018Tis said that the philosopher Stilpo, when oppressed with age, purposely\nhastened his end by drinking pure wine.  The same thing, but not designed\nby him, despatched also the philosopher Arcesilaus.\n\nBut \u2018tis an old and pleasant question, whether the soul of a wise man can\nbe overcome by the strength of wine?\n\n               \u201cSi munitae adhibet vim sapientiae.\u201d\n\nTo what vanity does the good opinion we have of ourselves push us?  The\nmost regular and most perfect soul in the world has but too much to do to\nkeep itself upright, and from being overthrown by its own weakness.\nThere is not one of a thousand that is right and settled so much as one\nminute in a whole life, and that may not very well doubt, whether\naccording to her natural condition she ever can be; but to join constancy\nto it is her utmost perfection; I mean when nothing should jostle and\ndiscompose her, which a thousand accidents may do.  \u2018Tis to much purpose\nthat the great poet Lucretius keeps such a clatter with his philosophy,\nwhen, behold!  he goes mad with a love philtre.  Is it to be imagined\nthat an apoplexy will not stun Socrates as well as a porter?  Some men\nhave forgotten their own names by the violence of a disease; and a slight\nwound has turned the judgment of others topsy-turvy.  Let him be as wise\nas he will, after all he is but a man; and than that what is there more\nfrail, more miserable, or more nothing?  Wisdom does not force our\nnatural dispositions,\n\n               \u201cSudores itaque, et pallorem exsistere toto\n               Corpore, et infringi linguam, vocemque aboriri,\n               Caligare oculos, sonere aures, succidere artus,\n               Demque concidere, ex animi terrore, videmus.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cSweat and paleness come over the whole body, the tongue is\n     rendered powerless, the voice dies away, the eyes are darkened,\n     there is ringing in the ears, the limbs sink under us by the\n     influence of fear.\u201d--Lucretius, iii. 155.]\n\nhe must shut his eyes against the blow that threatens him; he must\ntremble upon the margin of a precipice, like a child; nature having\nreserved these light marks of her authority, not to be forced by our\nreason and the stoic virtue, to teach man his mortality and our weakness;\nhe turns pale with fear, red with shame, and groans with the cholic, if\nnot with desperate outcry, at least with hoarse and broken voice:\n\n               \u201cHumani a se nihil alienum putet.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cLet him not think himself exempt from that which is incidental to\n     men in general.\u201d--Terence, Heauton, i. 1, 25.]\n\nThe poets, that feign all things at pleasure, dare not acquit their\ngreatest heroes of tears:\n\n          \u201cSic fatur lacrymans, classique immittit habenas.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThus he speaks, weeping, and then sets sail with his fleet.\u201d\n      --Aeneid, vi. i.]\n\n\u2018Tis sufficient for a man to curb and moderate his inclinations, for\ntotally to suppress them is not in him to do.  Even our great Plutarch,\nthat excellent and perfect judge of human actions, when he sees Brutus\nand Torquatus kill their children, begins to doubt whether virtue could\nproceed so far, and to question whether these persons had not rather been\nstimulated by some other passion.--[Plutarch, Life of Publicola, c.  3.]\n--All actions exceeding the ordinary bounds are liable to sinister\ninterpretation, for as much as our liking no more holds with what is\nabove than with what is below it.\n\nLet us leave that other sect, that sets up an express profession of\nscornful superiority--[The Stoics.]--: but when even in that sect,\nreputed the most quiet and gentle, we hear these rhodomontades of\nMetrodorus:\n\n          \u201cOccupavi te, Fortuna, atque cepi: omnesque aditus tuos\n          interclusi ut ad me aspirare non posses;\u201d\n\n     [\u201cFortune, I have got the better of thee, and have made all the\n     avenues so sure thou canst not come at me.\u201d\n      --Cicero, Tusc. Quaes., v. 9.]\n\nwhen Anaxarchus, by command of Nicocreon the tyrant of Cyprus, was put\ninto a stone mortar, and laid upon with mauls of iron, ceases not to say,\n\u201cStrike, batter, break; \u2018tis not Anaxarchus, \u2018tis but his sheath that you\npound and bray so\u201d; when we hear our martyrs cry out to the tyrant from\nthe middle of the flame, \u201cThis side is roasted enough, fall to and eat,\nit is enough done; fall to work with the other;\u201d when we hear the child\nin Josephus\u2019 torn piece-meal with pincers, defying Antiochus, and crying\nout with a constant and assured voice: \u201cTyrant, thou losest thy labour,\nI am still at ease; where is the pain, where are the torments with which\nthou didst so threaten me?  Is this all thou canst do?  My constancy\ntorments thee more than thy cruelty does me.  O pitiful coward, thou\nfaintest, and I grow stronger; make me complain, make me bend, make me\nyield if thou canst; encourage thy guards, cheer up thy executioners;\nsee, see they faint, and can do no more; arm them, flesh them anew, spur\nthem up\u201d; truly, a man must confess that there is some phrenzy, some\nfury, how holy soever, that at that time possesses those souls.  When we\ncome to these Stoical sallies: \u201cI had rather be mad than voluptuous,\u201d a\nsaying of Antisthenes.  When Sextius tells us, \u201che had rather be fettered\nwith affliction than pleasure\u201d: when Epicurus takes upon him to play with\nhis gout, and, refusing health and ease, defies all torments, and\ndespising the lesser pains, as disdaining to contend with them, he covets\nand calls out for others sharper, more violent, and more worthy of him;\n\n          \u201cSpumantemque dari, pecora inter inertia, votis\n          Optat aprum, aut fulvum descendere monte leonem:\u201d\n\n     [\u201cAnd instead of timid beasts, wishes the foaming boar or tawny lion\n     would come from the mountain.\u201d--AEneid, iv. 158.]\n\nwho but must conclude that these are wild sallies pushed on by a courage\nthat has broken loose from its place?  Our soul cannot from her own seat\nreach so high; \u2018tis necessary she must leave it, raise herself up, and,\ntaking the bridle in her teeth, transport her man so far that he shall\nafterwards himself be astonished at what he has done; as, in war, the\nheat of battle impels generous soldiers to perform things of so infinite\ndanger, as afterwards, recollecting them, they themselves are the first\nto wonder at; as it also fares with the poets, who are often rapt with\nadmiration of their own writings, and know not where again to find the\ntrack through which they performed so fine a Career; which also is in\nthem called fury and rapture.  And as Plato says, \u2018tis to no purpose for\na sober-minded man to knock at the door of poesy: so Aristotle says, that\nno excellent soul is exempt from a mixture of madness; and he has reason\nto call all transports, how commendable soever, that surpass our own\njudgment and understanding, madness; forasmuch as wisdom is a regular\ngovernment of the soul, which is carried on with measure and proportion,\nand for which she is to herself responsible.  Plato argues thus, that the\nfaculty of prophesying is so far above us, that we must be out of\nourselves when we meddle with it, and our prudence must either be\nobstructed by sleep or sickness, or lifted from her place by some\ncelestial rapture.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nA CUSTOM OF THE ISLE OF CEA\n\n          [Cos.  Cea is the form of the name given by Pliny]\n\nIf to philosophise be, as \u2018tis defined, to doubt, much more to write at\nrandom and play the fool, as I do, ought to be reputed doubting, for it\nis for novices and freshmen to inquire and to dispute, and for the\nchairman to moderate and determine.\n\nMy moderator is the authority of the divine will, that governs us without\ncontradiction, and that is seated above these human and vain\ncontestations.\n\nPhilip having forcibly entered into Peloponnesus, and some one saying to\nDamidas that the Lacedaemonians were likely very much to suffer if they\ndid not in time reconcile themselves to his favour:  \u201cWhy, you pitiful\nfellow,\u201d replied he, \u201cwhat can they suffer who do not fear to die?\u201d  It\nbeing also asked of Agis, which way a man might live free?  \u201cWhy,\u201d said\nhe, \u201cby despising death.\u201d  These, and a thousand other sayings to the\nsame purpose, distinctly sound of something more than the patient\nattending the stroke of death when it shall come; for there are several\naccidents in life far worse to suffer than death itself.  Witness the\nLacedaemonian boy taken by Antigonus, and sold for a slave, who being by\nhis master commanded to some base employment: \u201cThou shalt see,\u201d says the\nboy, \u201cwhom thou hast bought; it would be a shame for me to serve, being\nso near the reach of liberty,\u201d and having so said, threw himself from the\ntop of the house.  Antipater severely threatening the Lacedaemonians,\nthat he might the better incline them to acquiesce in a certain demand of\nhis: \u201cIf thou threatenest us with more than death,\u201d replied they, \u201cwe\nshall the more willingly die\u201d; and to Philip, having written them word\nthat he would frustrate all their enterprises: \u201cWhat, wilt thou also\nhinder us from dying?\u201d  This is the meaning of the sentence, \u201cThat the\nwise man lives as long as he ought, not so long as he can; and that the\nmost obliging present Nature has made us, and which takes from us all\ncolour of complaint of our condition, is to have delivered into our own\ncustody the keys of life; she has only ordered, one door into life, but a\nhundred thousand ways out.  We may be straitened for earth to live upon,\nbut earth sufficient to die upon can never be wanting, as Boiocalus\nanswered the Romans.\u201d--[Tacitus, Annal., xiii.  56.]--Why dost thou\ncomplain of this world?  it detains thee not; thy own cowardice is the\ncause, if thou livest in pain.  There needs no more to die but to will to\ndie:\n\n               \u201cUbique mors est; optime hoc cavit deus.\n               Eripere vitam nemo non homini potest;\n               At nemo mortem; mille ad hanc aditus patent.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cDeath is everywhere: heaven has well provided for that.  Any one\n     may deprive us of life; no one can deprive us of death.  To death\n     there are a thousand avenues.\u201d--Seneca, Theb:, i, I, 151.]\n\nNeither is it a recipe for one disease only; death is the infallible cure\nof all; \u2018tis a most assured port that is never to be feared, and very\noften to be sought.  It comes all to one, whether a man give himself his\nend, or stays to receive it by some other means; whether he pays before\nhis day, or stay till his day of payment come; from whencesoever it\ncomes, it is still his; in what part soever the thread breaks, there\u2019s\nthe end of the clue.  The most voluntary death is the finest.  Life\ndepends upon the pleasure of others; death upon our own.  We ought not to\naccommodate ourselves to our own humour in anything so much as in this.\nReputation is not concerned in such an enterprise; \u2018tis folly to be\nconcerned by any such apprehension. Living is slavery if the liberty of\ndying be wanting.  The ordinary method of cure is carried on at the\nexpense of life; they torment us with caustics, incisions, and\namputations of limbs; they interdict aliment and exhaust our blood; one\nstep farther and we are cured indeed and effectually.  Why is not the\njugular vein as much at our disposal as the median vein?  For a desperate\ndisease a desperate cure.  Servius the grammarian, being tormented with\nthe gout, could think of no better remedy than to apply poison to his\nlegs, to deprive them of their sense; let them be gouty at their will, so\nthey were insensible of pain.  God gives us leave enough to go when He is\npleased to reduce us to such a condition that to live is far worse than\nto die.  \u2018Tis weakness to truckle under infirmities, but it\u2019s madness to\nnourish them.  The Stoics say, that it is living according to nature in a\nwise man to, take his leave of life, even in the height of prosperity,\nif he do it opportunely; and in a fool to prolong it, though he be\nmiserable, provided he be not indigent of those things which they repute\nto be according to nature.  As I do not offend the law against thieves\nwhen I embezzle my own money and cut my own purse; nor that against\nincendiaries when I burn my own wood; so am I not under the lash of those\nmade against murderers for having deprived myself of my own life.\nHegesias said, that as the condition of life did, so the condition of\ndeath ought to depend upon our own choice.  And Diogenes meeting the\nphilosopher Speusippus, so blown up with an inveterate dropsy that he was\nfain to be carried in a litter, and by him saluted with the compliment,\n\u201cI wish you good health.\u201d  \u201cNo health to thee,\u201d replied the other,\n\u201cwho art content to live in such a condition.\u201d\n\nAnd in fact, not long after, Speusippus, weary of so languishing a state\nof life, found a means to die.\n\nBut this does not pass without admitting a dispute: for many are of\nopinion that we cannot quit this garrison of the world without the\nexpress command of Him who has placed us in it; and that it appertains to\nGod who has placed us here, not for ourselves only but for His Glory and\nthe service of others, to dismiss us when it shall best please Him, and\nnot for us to depart without His licence: that we are not born for\nourselves only, but for our country also, the laws of which require an\naccount from us upon the score of their own interest, and have an action\nof manslaughter good against us; and if these fail to take cognisance of\nthe fact, we are punished in the other world as deserters of our duty:\n\n         \u201cProxima deinde tenent maesti loca, qui sibi letum\n          Insontes peperere manu, lucemque perosi\n          Proiecere animas.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThence the sad ones occupy the next abodes, who, though free\n     from guilt, were by their own hands slain, and, hating light,\n     sought death.\u201d--AEneid, vi. 434.]\n\nThere is more constancy in suffering the chain we are tied to than in\nbreaking it, and more pregnant evidence of fortitude in Regulus than in\nCato; \u2018tis indiscretion and impatience that push us on to these\nprecipices: no accidents can make true virtue turn her back; she seeks\nand requires evils, pains, and grief, as the things by which she is\nnourished and supported; the menaces of tyrants, racks, and tortures\nserve only to animate and rouse her:\n\n              \u201cDuris ut ilex tonsa bipennibus\n               Nigrae feraci frondis in Algido,\n               Per damma, percmdes, ab ipso\n               Ducit opes, animumque ferro.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cAs in Mount Algidus, the sturdy oak even from the axe itself\n     derives new vigour and life.\u201d--Horace, Od., iv. 4, 57.]\n\nAnd as another says:\n\n              \u201cNon est, ut putas, virtus, pater,\n               Timere vitam; sed malis ingentibus\n               Obstare, nec se vertere, ac retro dare.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cFather, \u2018tis no virtue to fear life, but to withstand great\n     misfortunes, nor turn back from them.\u201d--Seneca, Theb., i. 190.]\n\nOr as this:\n\n          \u201cRebus in adversis facile est contemnere mortem\n          Fortius ille facit, qui miser esse potest.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cIt is easy in adversity to despise death; but he acts more\n     bravely, who can live wretched.\u201d--Martial, xi. 56, 15.]\n\n\u2018Tis cowardice, not virtue, to lie squat in a furrow, under a tomb, to\nevade the blows of fortune; virtue never stops nor goes out of her path,\nfor the greatest storm that blows:\n\n                    \u201cSi fractus illabatur orbis,\n                    Impavidum ferient ruinae.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cShould the world\u2019s axis crack, the ruins will but crush\n      a fearless head.\u201d--Horace, Od., iii. 3, 7.]\n\nFor the most part, the flying from other inconveniences brings us to\nthis; nay, endeavouring to evade death, we often run into its very mouth:\n\n          \u201cHic, rogo, non furor est, ne moriare, mori?\u201d\n\n     [\u201cTell me, is it not madness, that one should die for fear\n     of dying?\u201d--Martial, ii. 80, 2.]\n\nlike those who, from fear of a precipice, throw themselves headlong into\nit;\n\n              \u201cMultos in summa pericula misfit\n               Venturi timor ipse mali: fortissimus ille est,\n               Qui promptus metuenda pati, si cominus instent,\n               Et differre potest.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThe fear of future ills often makes men run into extreme danger;\n     he is truly brave who boldly dares withstand the mischiefs he\n     apprehends, when they confront him and can be deferred.\u201d\n      --Lucan, vii. 104.]\n\n               \u201cUsque adeo, mortis formidine, vitae\n               Percipit humanos odium, lucisque videndae,\n               Ut sibi consciscant moerenti pectore lethum\n               Obliti fontem curarum hunc esse timorem.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cDeath to that degree so frightens some men, that causing them to\n     hate both life and light, they kill themselves, miserably forgetting\n     that this same fear is the fountain of their cares.\u201d\n      --Lucretius, iii. 79.]\n\nPlato, in his Laws, assigns an ignominious sepulture to him who has\ndeprived his nearest and best friend, namely himself, of life and his\ndestined course, being neither compelled so to do by public judgment,\nby any sad and inevitable accident of fortune, nor by any insupportable\ndisgrace, but merely pushed on by cowardice and the imbecility of a\ntimorous soul.  And the opinion that makes so little of life, is\nridiculous; for it is our being, \u2018tis all we have.  Things of a nobler\nand more elevated being may, indeed, reproach ours; but it is against\nnature for us to contemn and make little account of ourselves; \u2018tis a\ndisease particular to man, and not discerned in any other creatures, to\nhate and despise itself.  And it is a vanity of the same stamp to desire\nto be something else than what we are; the effect of such a desire does\nnot at all touch us, forasmuch as it is contradicted and hindered in\nitself.  He that desires of a man to be made an angel, does nothing for\nhimself; he would be never the better for it; for, being no more, who\nshall rejoice or be sensible of this benefit for him.\n\n         \u201cDebet enim, misere cui forti, aegreque futurum est,\n          Ipse quoque esse in eo turn tempore, cum male possit\n          Accidere.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cFor he to whom misery and pain are to be in the future, must\n     himself then exist, when these ills befall him.\u201d\n      --Idem, ibid., 874.]\n\nSecurity, indolence, impassability, the privation of the evils of this\nlife, which we pretend to purchase at the price of dying, are of no\nmanner of advantage to us: that man evades war to very little purpose who\ncan have no fruition of peace; and as little to the purpose does he avoid\ntrouble who cannot enjoy repose.\n\nAmongst those of the first of these two opinions, there has been great\ndebate, what occasions are sufficient to justify the meditation of\nself-murder, which they call \u201cA reasonable exit.\u201d--[ Diogenes Laertius,\nLife of Zeno.]--For though they say that men must often die for trivial\ncauses, seeing those that detain us in life are of no very great weight,\nyet there is to be some limit.  There are fantastic and senseless humours\nthat have prompted not only individual men, but whole nations to destroy\nthemselves, of which I have elsewhere given some examples; and we further\nread of the Milesian virgins, that by a frantic compact they hanged\nthemselves one after another till the magistrate took order in it,\nenacting that the bodies of such as should be found so hanged should be\ndrawn by the same halter stark naked through the city.  When Therykion\ntried to persuade Cleomenes to despatch himself, by reason of the ill\nposture of his affairs, and, having missed a death of more honour in the\nbattle he had lost, to accept of this the second in honour to it, and not\nto give the conquerors leisure to make him undergo either an ignominious\ndeath or an infamous life; Cleomenes, with a courage truly Stoic and\nLacedaemonian, rejected his counsel as unmanly and mean; \u201cthat,\u201d said he,\n\u201cis a remedy that can never be wanting, but which a man is never to make\nuse of, whilst there is an inch of hope remaining\u201d: telling him, \u201cthat\nit was sometimes constancy and valour to live; that he would that even\nhis death should be of use to his country, and would make of it an act of\nhonour and virtue.\u201d  Therykion, notwithstanding, thought himself in the\nright, and did his own business; and Cleomenes afterwards did the same,\nbut not till he had first tried the utmost malevolence of fortune.  All\nthe inconveniences in the world are not considerable enough that a man\nshould die to evade them; and, besides, there being so many, so sudden\nand unexpected changes in human things, it is hard rightly to judge when\nwe are at the end of our hope:\n\n              \u201cSperat et in saeva victus gladiator arena,\n               Sit licet infesto pollice turba minax.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThe gladiator conquered in the lists hopes on, though the\n     menacing spectators, turning their thumb, order him to die.\u201d\n      --Pentadius, De Spe, ap. Virgilii Catadecta.]\n\nAll things, says an old adage, are to be hoped for by a man whilst he\nlives; ay, but, replies Seneca, why should this rather be always running\nin a man\u2019s head that fortune can do all things for the living man, than\nthis, that fortune has no power over him that knows how to die?\nJosephus, when engaged in so near and apparent danger, a whole people\nbeing violently bent against him, that there was no visible means of\nescape, nevertheless, being, as he himself says, in this extremity\ncounselled by one of his friends to despatch himself, it was well for him\nthat he yet maintained himself in hope, for fortune diverted the accident\nbeyond all human expectation, so that he saw himself delivered without\nany manner of inconvenience.  Whereas Brutus and Cassius, on the\ncontrary, threw away the remains of the Roman liberty, of which they were\nthe sole protectors, by the precipitation and temerity wherewith they\nkilled themselves before the due time and a just occasion.  Monsieur\nd\u2019Anguien, at the battle of Serisolles, twice attempted to run himself\nthrough, despairing of the fortune of the day, which went indeed very\nuntowardly on that side of the field where he was engaged, and by that\nprecipitation was very near depriving himself of the enjoyment of so\nbrave a victory.  I have seen a hundred hares escape out of the very\nteeth of the greyhounds:\n\n               \u201cAliquis carnifici suo superstes fuit.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cSome have survived their executioners.\u201d--Seneca, Ep., 13.]\n\n              \u201cMulta dies, variusque labor mutabilis nevi\n               Rettulit in melius; multos alterna revisens\n               Lusit, et in solido rursus fortuna locavit.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cLength of days, and the various labour of changeful time, have\n     brought things to a better state; fortune turning, shews a reverse\n     face, and again restores men to prosperity.\u201d--AEneid, xi. 425.]\n\nPiny says there are but three sorts of diseases, to escape which a man\nhas good title to destroy himself; the worst of which is the stone in the\nbladder, when the urine is suppressed.\n\n     [\u201cIn the quarto edition of these essays, in 1588, Pliny is said to\n     mention two more, viz., a pain in the stomach and a headache, which,\n     he says (lib. xxv. c. 9.), were the only three distempers almost\n     for which men killed themselves.\u201d]\n\nSeneca says those only which for a long time are discomposing the\nfunctions of the soul.  And some there have been who, to avoid a worse\ndeath, have chosen one to their own liking.  Democritus, general of the\nAEtolians, being brought prisoner to Rome, found means to make his escape\nby night: but close pursued by his keepers, rather than suffer himself to\nbe retaken, he fell upon his own sword and died.  Antinous and Theodotus,\ntheir city of Epirus being reduced by the Romans to the last extremity,\ngave the people counsel universally to kill themselves; but, these\npreferring to give themselves up to the enemy, the two chiefs went to\nseek the death they desired, rushing furiously upon the enemy, with\nintention to strike home but not to ward a blow.  The Island of Gozzo\nbeing taken some years ago by the Turks, a Sicilian, who had two\nbeautiful daughters marriageable, killed them both with his own hand, and\ntheir mother, running in to save them, to boot, which having done,\nsallying out of the house with a cross-bow and harquebus, with two shots\nhe killed two of the Turks nearest to his door, and drawing his sword,\ncharged furiously in amongst the rest, where he was suddenly enclosed and\ncut to pieces, by that means delivering his family and himself from\nslavery and dishonour.  The Jewish women, after having circumcised their\nchildren, threw them and themselves down a precipice to avoid the cruelty\nof Antigonus.  I have been told of a person of condition in one of our\nprisons, that his friends, being informed that he would certainly be\ncondemned, to avoid the ignominy of such a death suborned a priest to\ntell him that the only means of his deliverance was to recommend himself\nto such a saint, under such and such vows, and to fast eight days\ntogether without taking any manner of nourishment, what weakness or\nfaintness soever he might find in himself during the time; he followed\ntheir advice, and by that means destroyed himself before he was aware,\nnot dreaming of death or any danger in the experiment.  Scribonia\nadvising her nephew Libo to kill himself rather than await the stroke of\njustice, told him that it was to do other people\u2019s business to preserve\nhis life to put it after into the hands of those who within three or four\ndays would fetch him to execution, and that it was to serve his enemies\nto keep his blood to gratify their malice.\n\nWe read in the Bible that Nicanor, the persecutor of the law of God,\nhaving sent his soldiers to seize upon the good old man Razis, surnamed\nin honour of his virtue the father of the Jews: the good man, seeing no\nother remedy, his gates burned down, and the enemies ready to seize him,\nchoosing rather to die nobly than to fall into the hands of his wicked\nadversaries and suffer himself to be cruelly butchered by them, contrary\nto the honour of his rank and quality, stabbed himself with his own\nsword, but the blow, for haste, not having been given home, he ran and\nthrew himself from the top of a wall headlong among them, who separating\nthemselves and making room, he pitched directly upon his head;\nnotwithstanding which, feeling yet in himself some remains of life, he\nrenewed his courage, and starting up upon his feet all bloody and wounded\nas he was, and making his way through the crowd to a precipitous rock,\nthere, through one of his wounds, drew out his bowels, which, tearing and\npulling to pieces with both his hands, he threw amongst his pursuers, all\nthe while attesting and invoking the Divine vengeance upon them for their\ncruelty and injustice.\n\nOf violences offered to the conscience, that against the chastity of\nwoman is, in my opinion, most to be avoided, forasmuch as there is a\ncertain pleasure naturally mixed with it, and for that reason the dissent\ntherein cannot be sufficiently perfect and entire, so that the violence\nseems to be mixed with a little consent of the forced party.  The\necclesiastical history has several examples of devout persons who have\nembraced death to secure them from the outrages prepared by tyrants\nagainst their religion and honour.  Pelagia and Sophronia, both\ncanonised, the first of these precipitated herself with her mother and\nsisters into the river to avoid being forced by some soldiers, and the\nlast also killed herself to avoid being ravished by the Emperor\nMaxentius.\n\nIt may, peradventure, be an honour to us in future ages, that a learned\nauthor of this present time, and a Parisian, takes a great deal of pains\nto persuade the ladies of our age rather to take any other course than to\nenter into the horrid meditation of such a despair.  I am sorry he had\nnever heard, that he might have inserted it amongst his other stories,\nthe saying of a woman, which was told me at Toulouse, who had passed\nthrough the handling of some soldiers: \u201cGod be praised,\u201d said she, \u201cthat\nonce at least in my life I have had my fill without sin.\u201d  In truth,\nthese cruelties are very unworthy the French good nature, and also, God\nbe thanked, our air is very well purged of them since this good advice:\n\u2018tis enough that they say \u201cno\u201d in doing it, according to the rule of the\ngood Marot.\n\n              \u201cUn doulx nenny, avec un doulx sourire\n               Est tant honneste.\u201d--Marot.\n\nHistory is everywhere full of those who by a thousand ways have exchanged\na painful and irksome life for death.  Lucius Aruntius killed himself, to\nfly, he said, both the future and the past.  Granius Silvanus and Statius\nProximus, after having been pardoned by Nero, killed themselves; either\ndisdaining to live by the favour of so wicked a man, or that they might\nnot be troubled, at some other time, to obtain a second pardon,\nconsidering the proclivity of his nature to suspect and credit\naccusations against worthy men.  Spargapises, son of Queen Tomyris, being\na prisoner of war to Cyrus, made use of the first favour Cyrus shewed\nhim, in commanding him to be unbound, to kill himself, having pretended\nto no other benefit of liberty, but only to be revenged of himself for\nthe disgrace of being taken.  Boges, governor in Eion for King Xerxes,\nbeing besieged by the Athenian army under the conduct of Cimon, refused\nthe conditions offered, that he might safe return into Asia with all his\nwealth, impatient to survive the loss of a place his master had given him\nto keep; wherefore, having defended the city to the last extremity,\nnothing being left to eat, he first threw all the gold and whatever else\nthe enemy could make booty of into the river Strymon, and then causing a\ngreat pile to be set on fire, and the throats of all the women, children,\nconcubines, and servants to be cut, he threw their bodies into the fire,\nand at last leaped into it himself.\n\nNinachetuen, an Indian lord, so soon as he heard the first whisper of the\nPortuguese Viceroy\u2019s determination to dispossess him, without any\napparent cause, of his command in Malacca, to transfer it to the King of\nCampar, he took this resolution with himself: he caused a scaffold, more\nlong than broad, to be erected, supported by columns royally adorned with\ntapestry and strewed with flowers and abundance of perfumes; all which\nbeing prepared, in a robe of cloth of gold, set full of jewels of great\nvalue, he came out into the street, and mounted the steps to the\nscaffold, at one corner of which he had a pile lighted of aromatic wood.\nEverybody ran to see to what end these unusual preparations were made;\nwhen Ninachetuen, with a manly but displeased countenance, set forth how\nmuch he had obliged the Portuguese nation, and with how unspotted\nfidelity he had carried himself in his charge; that having so often,\nsword in hand, manifested in the behalf of others, that honour was much\nmore dear to him than life, he was not to abandon the concern of it for\nhimself: that fortune denying him all means of opposing the affront\ndesigned to be put upon him, his courage at least enjoined him to free\nhimself from the sense of it, and not to serve for a fable to the people,\nnor for a triumph to men less deserving than himself; which having said\nhe leaped into the fire.\n\nSextilia, wife of Scaurus, and Paxaea, wife of Labeo, to encourage their\nhusbands to avoid the dangers that pressed upon them, wherein they had no\nother share than conjugal affection, voluntarily sacrificed their own\nlives to serve them in this extreme necessity for company and example.\nWhat they did for their husbands, Cocceius Nerva did for his country,\nwith less utility though with equal affection: this great lawyer,\nflourishing in health, riches, reputation, and favour with the Emperor,\nhad no other cause to kill himself but the sole compassion of the\nmiserable state of the Roman Republic.  Nothing can be added to the\nbeauty of the death of the wife of Fulvius, a familiar favourite of\nAugustus: Augustus having discovered that he had vented an important\nsecret he had entrusted him withal, one morning that he came to make his\ncourt, received him very coldly and looked frowningly upon him.  He\nreturned home, full of, despair, where he sorrowfully told his wife that,\nhaving fallen into this misfortune, he was resolved to kill himself: to\nwhich she roundly replied, \u201c\u2018tis but reason you should, seeing that\nhaving so often experienced the incontinence of my tongue, you could not\ntake warning: but let me kill myself first,\u201d and without any more saying\nran herself through the body with a sword.  Vibius Virrius, despairing of\nthe safety of his city besieged by the Romans and of their mercy, in the\nlast deliberation of his city\u2019s senate, after many arguments conducing to\nthat end, concluded that the most noble means to escape fortune was by\ntheir own hands: telling them that the enemy would have them in honour,\nand Hannibal would be sensible how many faithful friends he had\nabandoned; inviting those who approved of his advice to come to a good\nsupper he had ready at home, where after they had eaten well, they would\ndrink together of what he had prepared; a beverage, said he, that will\ndeliver our bodies from torments, our souls from insult, and our eyes and\nears from the sense of so many hateful mischiefs, as the conquered suffer\nfrom cruel and implacable conquerors.  I have, said he, taken order for\nfit persons to throw our bodies into a funeral pile before my door so\nsoon as we are dead.  Many enough approved this high resolution, but few\nimitated it; seven-and-twenty senators followed him, who, after having\ntried to drown the thought of this fatal determination in wine, ended the\nfeast with the mortal mess; and embracing one another, after they had\njointly deplored the misfortune of their country, some retired home to\ntheir own houses, others stayed to be burned with Vibius in his funeral\npyre; and were all of them so long in dying, the vapour of the wine\nhaving prepossessed the veins, and by that means deferred the effect of\npoison, that some of them were within an hour of seeing the enemy inside\nthe walls of Capua, which was taken the next morning, and of undergoing\nthe miseries they had at so dear a rate endeavoured to avoid.  Jubellius\nTaurea, another citizen of the same country, the Consul Fulvius returning\nfrom the shameful butchery he had made of two hundred and twenty-five\nsenators, called him back fiercely by name, and having made him stop:\n\u201cGive the word,\u201d said he, \u201cthat somebody may dispatch me after the\nmassacre of so many others, that thou mayest boast to have killed a much\nmore valiant man than thyself.\u201d  Fulvius, disdaining him as a man out of\nhis wits, and also having received letters from Rome censuring the\ninhumanity of his execution which tied his hands, Jubellius proceeded:\n\u201cSince my country has been taken, my friends dead, and having with my own\nhands slain my wife and children to rescue them from the desolation of\nthis ruin, I am denied to die the death of my fellow-citizens, let me\nborrow from virtue vengeance on this hated life,\u201d and therewithal drawing\na short sword he carried concealed about him, he ran it through his own\nbosom, falling down backward, and expiring at the consul\u2019s feet.\n\nAlexander, laying siege to a city of the Indies, those within, finding\nthemselves very hardly set, put on a vigorous resolution to deprive him\nof the pleasure of his victory, and accordingly burned themselves in\ngeneral, together with their city, in despite of his humanity: a new kind\nof war, where the enemies sought to save them, and they to destroy\nthemselves, doing to make themselves sure of death, all that men do to\nsecure life.\n\nAstapa, a city of Spain, finding itself weak in walls and defence to\nwithstand the Romans, the inhabitants made a heap of all their riches and\nfurniture in the public place; and, having ranged upon this heap all the\nwomen and children, and piled them round with wood and other combustible\nmatter to take sudden fire, and left fifty of their young men for the\nexecution of that whereon they had resolved, they made a desperate sally,\nwhere for want of power to overcome, they caused themselves to be every\nman slain.  The fifty, after having massacred every living soul\nthroughout the whole city, and put fire to this pile, threw themselves\nlastly into it, finishing their generous liberty, rather after an\ninsensible, than after a sorrowful and disgraceful manner, giving the\nenemy to understand, that if fortune had been so pleased, they had as\nwell the courage to snatch from them victory as they had to frustrate and\nrender it dreadful, and even mortal to those who, allured by the\nsplendour of the gold melting in this flame, having approached it,\na great number were there suffocated and burned, being kept from retiring\nby the crowd that followed after.\n\nThe Abydeans, being pressed by King Philip, put on the same resolution;\nbut, not having time, they could not put it \u2018in effect.  The king, who\nwas struck with horror at the rash precipitation of this execution (the\ntreasure and movables that they had condemned to the flames being first\nseized), drawing off his soldiers, granted them three days\u2019 time to kill\nthemselves in, that they might do it with more order and at greater ease:\nwhich time they filled with blood and slaughter beyond the utmost excess\nof all hostile cruelty, so that not so much as any one soul was left\nalive that had power to destroy itself.  There are infinite examples of\nlike popular resolutions which seem the more fierce and cruel in\nproportion as the effect is more universal, and yet are really less so\nthan when singly executed; what arguments and persuasion cannot do with\nindividual men, they can do with all, the ardour of society ravishing\nparticular judgments.\n\nThe condemned who would live to be executed in the reign of Tiberius,\nforfeited their goods and were denied the rites of sepulture; those who,\nby killing themselves, anticipated it, were interred, and had liberty to\ndispose of their estates by will.\n\nBut men sometimes covet death out of hope of a greater good.  \u201cI desire,\u201d\n says St. Paul, \u201cto be with Christ,\u201d and \u201cwho shall rid me of these\nbands?\u201d  Cleombrotus of Ambracia, having read Plato\u2019s Pheedo, entered\ninto so great a desire of the life to come that, without any other\noccasion, he threw himself into the sea.  By which it appears how\nimproperly we call this voluntary dissolution, despair, to which the\neagerness of hope often inclines us, and, often, a calm and temperate\ndesire proceeding from a mature and deliberate judgment.  Jacques du\nChastel, bishop of Soissons, in St. Louis\u2019s foreign expedition, seeing\nthe king and whole army upon the point of returning into France, leaving\nthe affairs of religion imperfect, took a resolution rather to go into\nParadise; wherefore, having taken solemn leave of his friends, he charged\nalone, in the sight of every one, into the enemy\u2019s army, where he was\npresently cut to pieces.  In a certain kingdom of the new discovered\nworld, upon a day of solemn procession, when the idol they adore is drawn\nabout in public upon a chariot of marvellous greatness; besides that many\nare then seen cutting off pieces of their flesh to offer to him, there\nare a number of others who prostrate themselves upon the place, causing\nthemselves to be crushed and broken to pieces under the weighty wheels,\nto obtain the veneration of sanctity after death, which is accordingly\npaid them.  The death of the bishop, sword in hand, has more of\nmagnanimity in it, and less of sentiment, the ardour of combat taking\naway part of the latter.\n\nThere are some governments who have taken upon them to regulate the\njustice and opportunity of voluntary death.  In former times there was\nkept in our city of Marseilles a poison prepared out of hemlock, at the\npublic charge, for those who had a mind to hasten their end, having\nfirst, before the six hundred, who were their senate, given account of\nthe reasons and motives of their design, and it was not otherwise lawful,\nthan by leave from the magistrate and upon just occasion to do violence\nto themselves.--[Valerius Maximus, ii. 6, 7.]--The same law was also\nin use in other places.\n\nSextus Pompeius, in his expedition into Asia, touched at the isle of Cea\nin Negropont: it happened whilst he was there, as we have it from one\nthat was with him, that a woman of great quality, having given an account\nto her citizens why she was resolved to put an end to her life, invited\nPompeius to her death, to render it the more honourable, an invitation\nthat he accepted; and having long tried in vain by the power of his\neloquence, which was very great, and persuasion, to divert her from that\ndesign, he acquiesced in the end in her own will.  She had passed the age\nof four score and ten in a very happy state, both of body and mind; being\nthen laid upon her bed, better dressed than ordinary and leaning upon her\nelbow, \u201cThe gods,\u201d said she, \u201cO Sextus Pompeius, and rather those I leave\nthan those I go to seek, reward thee, for that thou hast not disdained to\nbe both the counsellor of my life and the witness of my death.  For my\npart, having always experienced the smiles of fortune, for fear lest the\ndesire of living too long may make me see a contrary face, I am going, by\na happy end, to dismiss the remains of my soul, leaving behind two\ndaughters of my body and a legion of nephews\u201d; which having said, with\nsome exhortations to her family to live in peace, she divided amongst\nthem her goods, and recommending her domestic gods to her eldest\ndaughter, she boldly took the bowl that contained the poison, and having\nmade her vows and prayers to Mercury to conduct her to some happy abode\nin the other world, she roundly swallowed the mortal poison.  This being\ndone, she entertained the company with the progress of its operation, and\nhow the cold by degrees seized the several parts of her body one after\nanother, till having in the end told them it began to seize upon her\nheart and bowels, she called her daughters to do the last office and\nclose her eyes.\n\nPliny tells us of a certain Hyperborean nation where, by reason of the\nsweet temperature of the air, lives rarely ended but by the voluntary\nsurrender of the inhabitants, who, being weary of and satiated with\nliving, had the custom, at a very old age, after having made good cheer,\nto precipitate themselves into the sea from the top of a certain rock,\nassigned for that service.  Pain and the fear of a worse death seem to me\nthe most excusable incitements.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nTO-MORROW\u2019S A NEW DAY\n\nI give, as it seems to me, with good reason the palm to Jacques Amyot of\nall our French writers, not only for the simplicity and purity of his\nlanguage, wherein he excels all others, nor for his constancy in going\nthrough so long a work,  nor for the depth of his knowledge, having been\nable so successfully to smooth and unravel so knotty and intricate an\nauthor (for let people tell me what they will, I understand nothing of\nGreek; but I meet with sense so well united and maintained throughout his\nwhole translation, that certainly he either knew the true fancy of the\nauthor, or having, by being long conversant with him, imprinted a vivid\nand general idea of that of Plutarch in his soul, he has delivered us\nnothing that either derogates from or contradicts him), but above all, I\nam the most taken with him for having made so discreet a choice of a book\nso worthy and of so great utility wherewith to present his country.  We\nignorant fellows had been lost, had not this book raised us out of the\ndirt; by this favour of his we dare now speak and write; the ladies are\nable to read to schoolmasters; \u2018tis our breviary.  If this good man be\nyet living, I would recommend to him Xenophon, to do as much by that;\n\u2018tis a much more easy task than the other, and consequently more proper\nfor his age.  And, besides, though I know not how, methinks he does\nbriskly--and clearly enough trip over steps another would have stumbled\nat, yet nevertheless his style seems to be more his own where he does not\nencounter those difficulties, and rolls away at his own ease.\n\nI was just now reading this passage where Plutarch says of himself, that\nRusticus being present at a declamation of his at Rome, there received a\npacket from the emperor, and deferred to open it till all was done: for\nwhich, says he, all the company highly applauded the gravity of this\nperson.  \u2018Tis true, that being upon the subject of curiosity and of that\neager passion for news, which makes us with so much indiscretion and\nimpatience leave all to entertain a newcomer, and without any manner of\nrespect or outcry, tear open on a sudden, in what company soever, the\nletters that are delivered to us, he had reason to applaud the gravity of\nRusticus upon this occasion; and might moreover have added to it the\ncommendation of his civility and courtesy, that would not interrupt the\ncurrent of his declamation.  But I doubt whether any one can commend his\nprudence; for receiving unexpected letters, and especially from an\nemperor, it might have fallen out that the deferring to read them might\nhave been of great prejudice.  The vice opposite to curiosity is\nnegligence, to which I naturally incline, and wherein I have seen some\nmen so extreme that one might have found letters sent them three or four\ndays before, still sealed up in their pockets.\n\nI never open any letters directed to another; not only those intrusted\nwith me, but even such as fortune has guided to my hand; and am angry\nwith myself if my eyes unawares steal any contents of letters of\nimportance he is reading when I stand near a great man.  Never was man\nless inquisitive or less prying into other men\u2019s affairs than I.\n\nIn our fathers\u2019 days, Monsieur de Boutieres had like to have lost Turin\nfrom having, while engaged in good company at supper, delayed to read\ninformation that was sent him of the treason plotted against that city\nwhere he commanded.  And this very Plutarch has given me to understand,\nthat Julius Caesar had preserved himself, if, going to the Senate the day\nhe was assassinated by the conspirators, he had read a note which was\npresented to him by, the way.  He tells also the story of Archias, the\ntyrant of Thebes, that the night before the execution of the design\nPelopidas had plotted to kill him to restore his country to liberty, he\nhad a full account sent him in writing by another Archias, an Athenian,\nof the whole conspiracy, and that, this packet having been delivered to\nhim while he sat at supper, he deferred the opening of it, saying, which\nafterwards turned to a proverb in Greece, \u201cBusiness to-morrow.\u201d\n\nA wise man may, I think, out of respect to another, as not to disturb the\ncompany, as Rusticus did, or not to break off another affair of\nimportance in hand, defer to read or hear any new thing that is brought\nhim; but for his own interest or particular pleasure, especially if he be\na public minister, that he will not interrupt his dinner or break his\nsleep is inexcusable.  And there was anciently at Rome, the consular\nplace, as they called it, which was the most honourable at the table, as\nbeing a place of most liberty, and of more convenient access to those who\ncame in to speak to the person seated there; by which it appears, that\nbeing at meat, they did not totally abandon the concern of other affairs\nand incidents.  But when all is said, it is very hard in human actions to\ngive so exact a rule upon moral reasons, that fortune will not therein\nmaintain her own right.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nOF CONSCIENCE\n\nThe Sieur de la Brousse, my brother, and I, travelling one day together\nduring the time of our civil wars, met a gentleman of good sort.  He was\nof the contrary party, though I did not know so much, for he pretended\notherwise: and the mischief on\u2019t is, that in this sort of war the cards\nare so shuffled, your enemy not being distinguished from yourself by any\napparent mark either of language or habit, and being nourished under the\nsame law, air, and manners, it is very hard to avoid disorder and\nconfusion.  This made me afraid myself of meeting any of our troops in a\nplace where I was not known, that I might not be in fear to tell my name,\nand peradventure of something worse; as it had befallen me before, where,\nby such a mistake, I lost both men and horses, and amongst others an\nItalian gentleman my page, whom I bred with the greatest care and\naffection, was miserably slain, in whom a youth of great promise and\nexpectation was extinguished.  But the gentleman my brother and I met\nhad so desperate, half-dead a fear upon him at meeting with any horse,\nor passing by any of the towns that held for the King, that I at last\ndiscovered it to be alarms of conscience.  It seemed to the poor man as\nif through his visor and the crosses upon his cassock, one would have\npenetrated into his bosom and read the most secret intentions of his\nheart; so wonderful is the power of conscience.  It makes us betray,\naccuse, and fight against ourselves, and for want of other witnesses, to\ngive evidence against ourselves:\n\n               \u201cOccultum quatiens animo tortore flagellum.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThe torturer of the soul brandishing a sharp scourge within.\u201d\n      --Juvenal, iii. 195.]\n\nThis story is in every child\u2019s mouth: Bessus the Paeonian, being\nreproached for wantonly pulling down a nest of young sparrows and killing\nthem, replied, that he had reason to do so, seeing that those little\nbirds never ceased falsely to accuse him of the murder of his father.\nThis parricide had till then been concealed and unknown, but the\nrevenging fury of conscience caused it to be discovered by him himself,\nwho was to suffer for it.  Hesiod corrects the saying of Plato, that\npunishment closely follows sin, it being, as he says, born at the same\ntime with it.  Whoever expects punishment already suffers it, and whoever\nhas deserved it expects it.  Wickedness contrives torments against\nitself:\n\n               \u201cMalum consilium consultori pessimum.\u201d\n\n               [\u201cIll designs are worst to the contriver.\u201d\n                --Apud Aul. Gellium, iv. 5.]\n\nas the wasp stings and hurts another, but most of all itself, for it\nthere loses its sting and its use for ever,\n\n                    \u201cVitasque in vulnere ponunt.\u201d\n\n               [\u201cAnd leave their own lives in the wound.\u201d\n                --Virgil, Geo., iv. 238.]\n\nCantharides have somewhere about them, by a contrariety of nature, a\ncounterpoison against their poison.  In like manner, at the same time\nthat men take delight in vice, there springs in the conscience a\ndispleasure that afflicts us sleeping and waking with various tormenting\nimaginations:\n\n              \u201cQuippe ubi se multi, per somnia saepe loquentes,\n               Aut morbo delirantes, protraxe ferantur,\n               Et celata diu in medium peccata dedisse.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cSurely where many, often talking in their sleep, or raving in\n     disease, are said to have betrayed themselves, and to have given\n     publicity to offences long concealed.\u201d--Lucretius, v. 1157.]\n\nApollodorus dreamed that he saw himself flayed by the Scythians and\nafterwards boiled in a cauldron, and that his heart muttered these words\n\u201cI am the cause of all these mischiefs that have befallen thee.\u201d\n Epicurus said that no hiding-hole could conceal the wicked, since they\ncould never assure themselves of being hid whilst their conscience\ndiscovered them to themselves.\n\n                    \u201cPrima est haec ultio, quod se\n               Judice nemo nocens absohitur.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cTis the first punishment of sin that no man absolves himself.\u201d or:\n     \u201cThis is the highest revenge, that by its judgment no offender is\n     absolved.\u201d--Juvenal, xiii. 2.]\n\nAs an ill conscience fills us with fear, so a good one gives us greater\nconfidence and assurance; and I can truly say that I have gone through\nseveral hazards with a more steady pace in consideration of the secret\nknowledge I had of my own will and the innocence of my intentions:\n\n         \u201cConscia mens ut cuique sua est, ita concipit intra\n          Pectora pro facto spemque metumque suo.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cAs a man\u2019s conscience is, so within hope or fear prevails, suiting\n     to his design.\u201d--Ovid, Fast., i. 485.]\n\nOf this are a thousand examples; but it will be enough to instance three\nof one and the same person.  Scipio, being one day accused before the\npeople of Rome of some crimes of a very high nature, instead of excusing\nhimself or flattering his judges: \u201cIt will become you well,\u201d said he,\n\u201cto sit in judgment upon a head, by whose means you have the power to\njudge all the world.\u201d  Another time, all the answer he gave to several\nimpeachments brought against him by a tribune of the people, instead of\nmaking his defence: \u201cLet us go, citizens,\u201d said he, \u201clet us go render\nthanks to the gods for the victory they gave me over the Carthaginians as\nthis day,\u201d and advancing himself before towards the Temple, he had\npresently all the assembly and his very accuser himself following at his\nheels.  And Petilius, having been set on by Cato to demand an account of\nthe money that had passed through his hands in the province of Antioch,\nScipio being come into the senate to that purpose, produced a book from\nunder his robe, wherein he told them was an exact account of his receipts\nand disbursements; but being required to deliver it to the prothonotary\nto be examined, he refused, saying, he would not do himself so great a\ndisgrace; and in the presence of the whole senate tore the book with his\nown hands to pieces.  I do not believe that the most seared conscience\ncould have counterfeited so great an assurance.  He had naturally too\nhigh a spirit and was accustomed to too high a fortune, says Titius\nLivius, to know how to be criminal, and to lower himself to the meanness\nof defending his innocence.  The putting men to the rack is a dangerous\ninvention, and seems to be rather a trial of patience than of truth.\nBoth he who has the fortitude to endure it conceals the truth, and he who\nhas not: for why should pain sooner make me confess what really is, than\nforce me to say what is not?  And, on the contrary, if he who is not\nguilty of that whereof he is accused, has the courage to undergo those\ntorments, why should not he who is guilty have the same, so fair a reward\nas life being in his prospect?  I believe the ground of this invention\nproceeds from the consideration of the force of conscience: for, to the\nguilty, it seems to assist the rack to make him confess his fault and to\nshake his resolution; and, on the other side, that it fortifies the\ninnocent against the torture.  But when all is done, \u2018tis, in plain\ntruth, a trial full of uncertainty and danger what would not a man say,\nwhat would not a man do, to avoid so intolerable torments?\n\n               \u201cEtiam innocentes cogit mentiri dolor.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cPain will make even the innocent lie.\u201d--Publius Syrus, De Dolore.]\n\nWhence it comes to pass, that him whom the judge has racked that he may\nnot die innocent, he makes him die both innocent and racked.  A thousand\nand a thousand have charged their own heads by false confessions, amongst\nwhom I place Philotas, considering the circumstances of the trial\nAlexander put upon him and the progress of his torture.  But so it is\nthat some say it is the least evil human weakness could invent; very\ninhumanly, notwithstanding, and to very little purpose, in my opinion.\n\nMany nations less barbarous in this than the Greeks and Romans who call\nthem so, repute it horrible and cruel to torment and pull a man to pieces\nfor a fault of which they are yet in doubt.  How can he help your\nignorance?  Are not you unjust, that, not to kill him without cause, do\nworse than kill him?  And that this is so, do but observe how often men\nprefer to die without reason than undergo this examination, more painful\nthan execution itself; and that oft-times by its extremity anticipates\nexecution, and perform it.  I know not where I had this story, but it\nexactly matches the conscience of our justice in this particular.  A\ncountry-woman, to a general of a very severe discipline, accused one of\nhis soldiers that he had taken from her children the little soup meat she\nhad left to nourish them withal, the army having consumed all the rest;\nbut of this proof there was none.  The general, after having cautioned\nthe woman to take good heed to what she said, for that she would make\nherself guilty of a false accusation if she told a lie, and she\npersisting, he presently caused the soldier\u2019s belly to be ripped up to\nclear the truth of the fact, and the woman was found to be right.  An\ninstructive sentence.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nUSE MAKES PERFECT\n\n\u2018Tis not to be expected that argument and instruction, though we never so\nvoluntarily surrender our belief to what is read to us, should be of\nforce to lead us on so far as to action, if we do not, over and above,\nexercise and form the soul by experience to the course for which we\ndesign it; it will, otherwise, doubtless find itself at a loss when it\ncomes to the pinch of the business.  This is the reason why those amongst\nthe philosophers who were ambitious to attain to a greater excellence,\nwere not contented to await the severities of fortune in the retirement\nand repose of their own habitations, lest he should have surprised them\nraw and inexpert in the combat, but sallied out to meet her, and\npurposely threw themselves into the proof of difficulties.  Some of them\nabandoned riches to exercise themselves in a voluntary poverty; others\nsought out labour and an austerity of life, to inure them to hardships\nand inconveniences; others have deprived themselves of their dearest\nmembers, as of sight, and of the instruments of generation, lest their\ntoo delightful and effeminate service should soften and debauch the\nstability of their souls.\n\nBut in dying, which is the greatest work we have to do, practice can give\nus no assistance at all.  A man may by custom fortify himself against\npain, shame, necessity, and such-like accidents, but as to death, we can\nexperiment it but once, and are all apprentices when we come to it.\nThere have, anciently, been men so excellent managers of their time that\nthey have tried even in death itself to relish and taste it, and who have\nbent their utmost faculties of mind to discover what this passage is, but\nthey are none of them come back to tell us the news:\n\n               \u201cNemo expergitus exstat,\n               Frigida quern semel est vitai pausa sequuta.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cNo one wakes who has once fallen into the cold sleep of death.\u201d\n      --Lucretius, iii. 942]\n\nJulius Canus, a noble Roman, of singular constancy and virtue, having\nbeen condemned to die by that worthless fellow Caligula, besides many\nmarvellous testimonies that he gave of his resolution, as he was just\ngoing to receive the stroke of the executioner, was asked by a\nphilosopher, a friend of his: \u201cWell, Canus, whereabout is your soul now?\nwhat is she doing?  What are you thinking of?\u201d--\u201cI was thinking,\u201d replied\nthe other, \u201cto keep myself ready, and the faculties of my mind full\nsettled and fixed, to try if in this short and quick instant of death, I\ncould perceive the motion of the soul when she parts from the body, and\nwhether she has any sentiment at the separation, that I may after come\nagain if I can, to acquaint my friends with it.\u201d  This man philosophises\nnot unto death only, but in death itself.  What a strange assurance was\nthis, and what bravery of courage, to desire his death should be a lesson\nto him, and to have leisure to think of other things in so great an\naffair:\n\n               \u201cJus hoc animi morientis habebat.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThis mighty power of mind he had dying.\u201d-Lucan, viii. 636.]\n\nAnd yet I fancy, there is a certain way of making it familiar to us, and\nin some sort of making trial what it is.  We may gain experience, if not\nentire and perfect, yet such, at least, as shall not be totally useless\nto us, and that may render us more confident and more assured.  If we\ncannot overtake it, we may approach it and view it, and if we do not\nadvance so far as the fort, we may at least discover and make ourselves\nacquainted with the avenues.  It is not without reason that we are taught\nto consider sleep as a resemblance of death: with how great facility do\nwe pass from waking to sleeping, and with how little concern do we lose\nthe knowledge of light and of ourselves.  Peradventure, the faculty of\nsleeping would seem useless and contrary to nature, since it deprives us\nof all action and sentiment, were it not that by it nature instructs us\nthat she has equally made us to die as to live; and in life presents to\nus the eternal state she reserves for us after it, to accustom us to it\nand to take from us the fear of it.  But such as have by violent accident\nfallen into a swoon, and in it have lost all sense, these, methinks, have\nbeen very near seeing the true and natural face of death; for as to the\nmoment of the passage, it is not to be feared that it brings with it any\npain or displeasure, forasmuch as we can have no feeling without leisure;\nour sufferings require time, which in death is so short, and so\nprecipitous, that it must necessarily be insensible.  They are the\napproaches that we are to fear, and these may fall within the limits of\nexperience.\n\nMany things seem greater by imagination than they are in effect; I have\npassed a good part of my life in a perfect and entire health; I say, not\nonly entire, but, moreover, sprightly and wanton.  This state, so full of\nverdure, jollity, and vigour, made the consideration of sickness so\nformidable to me, that when I came to experience it, I found the attacks\nfaint and easy in comparison with what I had apprehended.  Of this I have\ndaily experience; if I am under the shelter of a warm room, in a stormy\nand tempestuous night, I wonder how people can live abroad, and am\nafflicted for those who are out in the fields: if I am there myself, I do\nnot wish to be anywhere else.  This one thing of being always shut up in\na chamber I fancied insupportable: but I was presently inured to be so\nimprisoned a week, nay a month together, in a very weak, disordered, and\nsad condition; and I have found that, in the time of my health, I much\nmore pitied the sick, than I think myself to be pitied when I am so, and\nthat the force of my imagination enhances near one-half of the essence\nand reality of the thing.  I hope that when I come to die I shall find it\nthe same, and that, after all, it is not worth the pains I take, so much\npreparation and so much assistance as I call in, to undergo the stroke.\nBut, at all events, we cannot give ourselves too much advantage.\n\nIn the time of our third or second troubles (I do not well remember\nwhich), going one day abroad to take the air, about a league from my own\nhouse, which is seated in the very centre of all the bustle and mischief\nof the late civil wars in France; thinking myself in all security and so\nnear to my retreat that I stood in need of no better equipage, I had\ntaken a horse that went very easy upon his pace, but was not very strong.\nBeing upon my return home, a sudden occasion falling out to make use of\nthis horse in a kind of service that he was not accustomed to, one of my\ntrain, a lusty, tall fellow, mounted upon a strong German horse, that had\na very ill mouth, fresh and vigorous, to play the brave and set on ahead\nof his fellows, comes thundering full speed in the very track where I\nwas, rushing like a Colossus upon the little man and the little horse,\nwith such a career of strength and weight, that he turned us both over\nand over, topsy-turvy with our heels in the air: so that there lay the\nhorse overthrown and stunned with the fall, and I ten or twelve paces\nfrom him stretched out at length, with my face all battered and broken,\nmy sword which I had had in my hand, above ten paces beyond that, and my\nbelt broken all to pieces, without motion or sense any more than a stock.\n\u2018Twas the only swoon I was ever in till that hour in my life.  Those who\nwere with me, after having used all the means they could to bring me to\nmyself, concluding me dead, took me up in their arms, and carried me with\nvery much difficulty home to my house, which was about half a French\nleague from thence.  On the way, having been for more than two hours\ngiven over for a dead man, I began to move and to fetch my breath; for so\ngreat abundance of blood was fallen into my stomach, that nature had need\nto rouse her forces to discharge it.  They then raised me upon my feet,\nwhere I threw off a whole bucket of clots of blood, as this I did also\nseveral times by the way.  This gave me so much ease, that I began to\nrecover a little life, but so leisurely and by so small advances, that my\nfirst sentiments were much nearer the approaches of death than life:\n\n               \u201cPerche, dubbiosa ancor del suo ritorno,\n               Non s\u2019assicura attonita la mente.\u201d\n\n    [\u201cFor the soul, doubtful as to its return, could not compose itself\u201d\n      --Tasso, Gierus.  Lib., xii. 74.]\n\nThe remembrance of this accident, which is very well imprinted in my\nmemory, so naturally representing to me the image and idea of death, has\nin some sort reconciled me to that untoward adventure.  When I first\nbegan to open my eyes, it was with so perplexed, so weak and dead a\nsight, that I could yet distinguish nothing but only discern the light:\n\n               \u201cCome quel ch\u2019or apre, or\u2019chiude\n               Gli occhi, mezzo tra\u2019l sonno e l\u2019esser desto.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cAs a man that now opens, now shuts his eyes, between sleep\n     and waking.\u201d--Tasso, Gierus.  Lib., viii., 26.]\n\nAs to the functions of the soul, they advanced with the same pace and\nmeasure with those of the body.  I saw myself all bloody, my doublet\nbeing stained all over with the blood I had vomited.  The first thought\nthat came into my mind was that I had a harquebuss shot in my head, and\nindeed, at the time there were a great many fired round about us.\nMethought my life but just hung upon my, lips: and I shut my eyes, to\nhelp, methought, to thrust it out, and took a pleasure in languishing and\nletting myself go.  It was an imagination that only superficially floated\nupon my soul, as tender and weak as all the rest, but really, not only\nexempt from anything displeasing, but mixed with that sweetness that\npeople feel when they glide into a slumber.\n\nI believe it is the very same condition those people are in, whom we see\nswoon with weakness in the agony of death we pity them without cause,\nsupposing them agitated with grievous dolours, or that their souls suffer\nunder painful thoughts.  It has ever been my belief, contrary to the\nopinion of many, and particularly of La Boetie, that those whom we see so\nsubdued and stupefied at the approaches of their end, or oppressed with\nthe length of the disease, or by accident of an apoplexy or falling\nsickness,\n\n         \u201cVi morbi saepe coactus\n          Ante oculos aliquis nostros, ut fulminis ictu,\n          Concidit, et spumas agit; ingemit, et tremit artus;\n          Desipit, extentat nervos, torquetur, anhelat,\n          Inconstanter, et in jactando membra fatigat;\u201d\n\n     [\u201cOften, compelled by the force of disease, some one as\n     thunderstruck falls under our eyes, and foams, groans, and trembles,\n     stretches, twists, breathes irregularly, and in paroxysms wears out\n     his strength.\u201d--Lucretius, iii. 485.]\n\nor hurt in the head, whom we hear to mutter, and by fits to utter\ngrievous groans; though we gather from these signs by which it seems as\nif they had some remains of consciousness, and that there are movements\nof the body; I have always believed, I say, both the body and the soul\nbenumbed and asleep,\n\n               \u201cVivit, et est vitae nescius ipse suae,\u201d\n\n               [\u201cHe lives, and does not know that he is alive.\u201d\n                --Ovid, Trist., i. 3, 12.]\n\nand could not believe that in so great a stupefaction of the members and\nso great a defection of the senses, the soul could maintain any force\nwithin to take cognisance of herself, and that, therefore, they had no\ntormenting reflections to make them consider and be sensible of the\nmisery of their condition, and consequently were not much to be pitied.\n\nI can, for my part, think of no state so insupportable and dreadful, as\nto have the soul vivid and afflicted, without means to declare itself; as\none should say of such as are sent to execution with their tongues first\ncut out (were it not that in this kind of dying, the most silent seems to\nme the most graceful, if accompanied with a grave and constant\ncountenance); or if those miserable prisoners, who fall into the hands of\nthe base hangman soldiers of this age, by whom they are tormented with\nall sorts of inhuman usage to compel them to some excessive and\nimpossible ransom; kept, in the meantime, in such condition and place,\nwhere they have no means of expressing or signifying their thoughts and\ntheir misery.  The poets have feigned some gods who favour the\ndeliverance of such as suffer under a languishing death:\n\n                              \u201cHunc ego Diti\n               Sacrum jussa fero, teque isto corpore solvo.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cI bidden offer this sacred thing to Pluto, and from that body\n     dismiss thee.\u201d--AEneid, iv. 782.]\n\nboth the interrupted words, and the short and irregular answers one gets\nfrom them sometimes, by bawling and keeping a clutter about them; or the\nmotions which seem to yield some consent to what we would have them do,\nare no testimony, nevertheless, that they live, an entire life at least.\nSo it happens to us in the yawning of sleep, before it has fully\npossessed us, to perceive, as in a dream, what is done about us, and to\nfollow the last things that are said with a perplexed and uncertain\nhearing which seems but to touch upon the borders of the soul; and to\nmake answers to the last words that have been spoken to us, which have\nmore in them of chance than sense.\n\nNow seeing I have in effect tried it, I have no doubt but I have hitherto\nmade a right judgment; for first, being in a swoon, I laboured to rip\nopen the buttons of my doublet with my nails, for my sword was gone; and\nyet I felt nothing in my imagination that hurt me; for we have many\nmotions in us that do not proceed from our direction;\n\n          \u201cSemianimesque micant digiti, ferrumque retractant;\u201d\n\n     [\u201cHalf-dead fingers grope about, and grasp again the sword.\u201d\n      --AEneid, x. 396.]\n\nso falling people extend their arms before them by a natural impulse,\nwhich prompts our limbs to offices and motions without any commission\nfrom our reason.\n\n         \u201cFalciferos memorant currus abscindere membra .  .  .\n          Ut tremere in terra videatur ab artubus id quod\n          Decidit abscissum; cum mens tamen atque hominis vis\n          Mobilitate mali, non quit sentire dolorem.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThey relate that scythe-bearing chariots mow off limbs, so that\n     they quiver on the ground; and yet the mind of him from whom the\n     limb is taken by the swiftness of the blow feels no pain.\u201d\n      --Lucretius, iii. 642.]\n\nMy stomach was so oppressed with the coagulated blood, that my hands\nmoved to that part, of their own voluntary motion, as they frequently do\nto the part that itches, without being directed by our will.  There are\nseveral animals, and even men, in whom one may perceive the muscles to\nstir and tremble after they are dead.  Every one experimentally knows\nthat there are some members which grow stiff and flag without his leave.\nNow, those passions which only touch the outward bark of us, cannot be\nsaid to be ours: to make them so, there must be a concurrence of the\nwhole man; and the pains which are felt by the hand or the foot while\nwe are sleeping, are none of ours.\n\nAs I drew near my own house, where the alarm of my fall was already got\nbefore me, and my family were come out to meet me, with the hubbub usual\nin such cases, not only did I make some little answer to some questions\nwhich were asked me; but they moreover tell me, that I was sufficiently\ncollected to order them to bring a horse to my wife whom on the road,\nI saw struggling and tiring herself which is hilly and rugged.  This\nshould seem to proceed from a soul its functions; but it was nothing so\nwith me. I knew not what I said or did, and they were nothing but idle\nthoughts in the clouds, that were stirred up by the senses of the eyes\nand ears, and proceeded not from me.  I knew not for all that, whence I\ncame or whither I went, neither was I capable to weigh and consider what\nwas said to me: these were light effects, that the senses produced of\nthemselves as of custom; what the soul contributed was in a dream,\nlightly touched, licked and bedewed by the soft impression of the senses.\nNotwithstanding, my condition was, in truth, very easy and quiet; I had\nno affliction upon me, either for others or myself; it was an extreme\nlanguor and weakness, without any manner of pain.  I saw my own house,\nbut knew it not.  When they had put me to bed I found an inexpressible\nsweetness in that repose; for I had been desperately tugged and lugged by\nthose poor people who had taken the pains to carry me upon their arms a\nvery great and a very rough way, and had in so doing all quite tired out\nthemselves, twice or thrice one after another.  They offered me several\nremedies, but I would take none, certainly believing that I was mortally\nwounded in the head.  And, in earnest, it had been a very happy death,\nfor the weakness of my understanding deprived me of the faculty of\ndiscerning, and that of my body of the sense of feeling; I was suffering\nmyself to glide away so sweetly and after so soft and easy a manner, that\nI scarce find any other action less troublesome than that was.  But when\nI came again to myself and to resume my faculties:\n\n               \u201cUt tandem sensus convaluere mei,\u201d\n\n          [\u201cWhen at length my lost senses again returned.\u201d\n           --Ovid, Trist., i. 3, 14.]\n\nwhich was two or three hours after, I felt myself on a sudden involved in\nterrible pain, having my limbs battered and ground with my fall, and was.\nso ill for two or three nights after, that I thought I was once more\ndying again, but a more painful death, having concluded myself as good as\ndead before, and to this hour am sensible of the bruises of that terrible\nshock.  I will not here omit, that the last thing I could make them beat\ninto my head, was the memory of this accident, and I had it over and over\nagain repeated to me, whither I was going, from whence I came, and at\nwhat time of the day this mischance befell me, before I could comprehend\nit.  As to the manner of my fall, that was concealed from me in favour to\nhim who had been the occasion, and other flim-flams were invented.  But a\nlong time after, and the very next day that my memory began to return and\nto represent to me the state wherein I was, at the instant that I\nperceived this horse coming full drive upon me (for I had seen him at my\nheels, and gave myself for gone, but this thought had been so sudden,\nthat fear had had no leisure to introduce itself) it seemed to me like a\nflash of lightning that had pierced my soul, and that I came from the\nother world.\n\nThis long story of so light an accident would appear vain enough, were it\nnot for the knowledge I have gained by it for my own use; for I do really\nfind, that to get acquainted with death, needs no more but nearly to\napproach it.  Every one, as Pliny says, is a good doctrine to himself,\nprovided he be capable of discovering himself near at hand.  Here, this\nis not my doctrine, \u2018tis my study; and is not the lesson of another, but\nmy own; and if I communicate it, it ought not to be ill taken, for that\nwhich is of use to me, may also, peradventure, be useful to another.  As\nto the rest, I spoil nothing, I make use of nothing but my own; and if I\nplay the fool, \u2018tis at my own expense, and nobody else is concerned in\u2019t;\nfor \u2018tis a folly that will die with me, and that no one is to inherit.\nWe hear but of two or three of the ancients, who have beaten this path,\nand yet I cannot say if it was after this manner, knowing no more of them\nbut their names.  No one since has followed the track: \u2018tis a rugged\nroad, more so than it seems, to follow a pace so rambling and uncertain,\nas that of the soul; to penetrate the dark profundities of its intricate\ninternal windings; to choose and lay hold of so many little nimble\nmotions; \u2018tis a new and extraordinary undertaking, and that withdraws us\nfrom the common and most recommended employments of the world.  \u2018Tis now\nmany years since that my thoughts have had no other aim and level than\nmyself, and that I have only pried into and studied myself: or, if I\nstudy any other thing, \u2018tis to apply it to or rather in myself.  And yet\nI do not think it a fault, if, as others do by other much less profitable\nsciences, I communicate what I have learned in this, though I am not very\nwell pleased with my own progress.  There is no description so difficult,\nnor doubtless of so great utility, as that of a man\u2019s self: and withal, a\nman must curl his hair and set out and adjust himself, to appear in\npublic: now I am perpetually tricking myself out, for I am eternally upon\nmy own description.  Custom has made all speaking of a man\u2019s self\nvicious, and positively interdicts it, in hatred to the boasting that\nseems inseparable from the testimony men give of themselves:\n\n                    \u201cIn vitium ducit culpae fuga.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThe avoiding a mere fault often leads us into a greater.\u201d\n      Or: \u201cThe escape from a fault leads into a vice\u201d\n      --Horace, De Arte Poetics, verse 31.]\n\nInstead of blowing the child\u2019s nose, this is to take his nose off\naltogether.  I think the remedy worse than the disease.  But, allowing it\nto be true that it must of necessity be presumption to entertain people\nwith discourses of one\u2019s self, I ought not, pursuing my general design,\nto forbear an action that publishes this infirmity of mine, nor conceal\nthe fault which I not only practise but profess.  Notwithstanding, to\nspeak my thought freely, I think that the custom of condemning wine,\nbecause some people will be drunk, is itself to be condemned; a man\ncannot abuse anything but what is good in itself; and I believe that this\nrule has only regard to the popular vice.  They are bits for calves, with\nwhich neither the saints whom we hear speak so highly of themselves, nor\nthe philosophers, nor the divines will be curbed; neither will I, who am\nas little the one as the other, If they do not write of it expressly, at\nall events, when the occasions arise, they don\u2019t hesitate to put\nthemselves on the public highway.  Of what does Socrates treat more\nlargely than of himself?  To what does he more direct and address the\ndiscourses of his disciples, than to speak of themselves, not of the\nlesson in their book, but of the essence and motion of their souls?  We\nconfess ourselves religiously to God and our confessor; as our\nneighbours, do to all the people.  But some will answer that we there\nspeak nothing but accusation against ourselves; why then, we say all; for\nour very virtue itself is faulty and penetrable.  My trade and art is to\nlive; he that forbids me to speak according to my own sense, experience,\nand practice, may as well enjoin an architect not to speak of building\naccording to his own knowledge, but according to that of his neighbour;\naccording to the knowledge of another, and not according to his own.  If\nit be vainglory for a man to publish his own virtues, why does not Cicero\nprefer the eloquence of Hortensius, and Hortensius that of Cicero?\nPeradventure they mean that I should give testimony of myself by works\nand effects, not barely by words.  I chiefly paint my thoughts, a subject\nvoid of form and incapable of operative production; \u2018tis all that I can\ndo to couch it in this airy body of the voice; the wisest and devoutest\nmen have lived in the greatest care to avoid all apparent effects.\nEffects would more speak of fortune than of me; they manifest their own\noffice and not mine, but uncertainly and by conjecture; patterns of some\none particular virtue.  I expose myself entire; \u2018tis a body where, at one\nview, the veins, muscles, and tendons are apparent, every of them in its\nproper place; here the effects of a cold; there of the heart beating,\nvery dubiously.  I do not write my own acts, but myself and my essence.\n\nI am of opinion that a man must be very cautious how he values himself,\nand equally conscientious to give a true report, be it better or worse,\nimpartially.  If I thought myself perfectly good and wise, I would rattle\nit out to some purpose.  To speak less of one\u2019s self than what one really\nis is folly, not modesty; and to take that for current pay which is under\na man\u2019s value is pusillanimity and cowardice, according to, Aristotle.\nNo virtue assists itself with falsehood; truth is never matter of error.\nTo speak more of one\u2019s self than is really true is not always mere\npresumption; \u2018tis, moreover, very often folly; to, be immeasurably\npleased with what one is, and to fall into an indiscreet self-love, is in\nmy opinion the substance of this vice.  The most sovereign remedy to cure\nit, is to do quite contrary to what these people direct who, in\nforbidding men to speak of themselves, consequently, at the same time,\ninterdict thinking of themselves too.  Pride dwells in the thought; the\ntongue can have but a very little share in it.\n\nThey fancy that to think of one\u2019s self is to be delighted with one\u2019s\nself; to frequent and converse with one\u2019s self, to be overindulgent; but\nthis excess springs only in those who take but a superficial view of\nthemselves, and dedicate their main inspection to their affairs; who call\nit mere reverie and idleness to occupy one\u2019s self with one\u2019s self, and\nthe building one\u2019s self up a mere building of castles in the air; who\nlook upon themselves as a third person only, a stranger.  If any one be\nin rapture with his own knowledge, looking only on those below him, let\nhim but turn his eye upward towards past ages, and his pride will be\nabated, when he shall there find so many thousand wits that trample him\nunder foot.  If he enter into a flattering presumption of his personal\nvalour, let him but recollect the lives of Scipio, Epaminondas; so many\narmies, so many nations, that leave him so far behind them.  No\nparticular quality can make any man proud, that will at the same time put\nthe many other weak and imperfect ones he has in the other scale, and the\nnothingness of human condition to make up the weight.  Because Socrates\nhad alone digested to purpose the precept of his god, \u201cto know himself,\u201d\n and by that study arrived at the perfection of setting himself at nought,\nhe only was reputed worthy the title of a sage.

It was a pretty invention, and received into\nmost governments of the world, to institute certain vain and in\nthemselves valueless distinctions to honour and recompense virtue, such\nas the crowns of laurel, oak, and myrtle, the particular fashion of some\ngarment, the privilege to ride in a coach in the city, or at night with a\ntorch, some peculiar place assigned in public assemblies, the prerogative\nof certain additional names and titles, certain distinctions in the\nbearing of coats of arms, and the like, the use of which, according to\nthe several humours of nations, has been variously received, and yet\ncontinues.\n\nWe in France, as also several of our neighbours, have orders of\nknighthood that are instituted only for this end.  And \u2018tis, in earnest,\na very good and profitable custom to find out an acknowledgment for the\nworth of rare and excellent men, and to satisfy them with rewards that\nare not at all chargeable either to prince or people.  And that which has\nalways been found by ancient experience, and which we have heretofore\nobserved among ourselves, that men of quality have ever been more jealous\nof such recompenses than of those wherein there was gain and profit, is\nnot without very good ground and reason.  If with the reward, which ought\nto be simply a recompense of honour, they should mix other commodities\nand add riches, this mixture, instead of procuring an increase of\nestimation, would debase and abate it.  The Order of St. Michael, which\nhas been so long in repute amongst us, had no greater commodity than that\nit had no communication with any other commodity, which produced this\neffect, that formerly there was no office or title whatever to which the\ngentry pretended with so great desire and affection as they did to that;\nno quality that carried with it more respect and grandeur, valour and\nworth more willingly embracing and with greater ambition aspiring to a\nrecompense purely its own, and rather glorious than profitable.  For, in\ntruth, other gifts have not so great a dignity of usage, by reason they\nare laid out upon all sorts of occasions; with money a man pays the wages\nof a servant, the diligence of a courier, dancing, vaulting, speaking,\nand the meanest offices we receive; nay, and reward vice with it too, as\nflattery, treachery, and pimping; and therefore \u2018tis no wonder if virtue\nless desires and less willingly receives this common sort of payment,\nthan that which is proper and peculiar to her, throughout generous and\nnoble.  Augustus had reason to be more sparing of this than the other,\ninsomuch that honour is a privilege which derives its principal essence\nfrom rarity; and so virtue itself:\n\n          \u201cCui malus est nemo, quis bonus esse potest?\u201d\n\n     [\u201cTo whom no one is ill who can be good?\u201d-Martial, xii. 82.]\n\nWe do not intend it for a commendation when we say that such a one is\ncareful in the education of his children, by reason it is a common act,\nhow just and well done soever; no more than we commend a great tree,\nwhere the whole forest is the same.  I do not think that any citizen of\nSparta glorified himself much upon his valour, it being the universal\nvirtue of the whole nation; and as little upon his fidelity and contempt\nof riches.  There is no recompense becomes virtue, how great soever, that\nis once passed into a custom; and I know not withal whether we can ever\ncall it great, being common.\n\nSeeing, then, that these remunerations of honour have no other value and\nestimation but only this, that few people enjoy them, \u2018tis but to be\nliberal of them to bring them down to nothing.  And though there should\nbe now more men found than in former times worthy of our order, the\nestimation of it nevertheless should not be abated, nor the honour made\ncheap; and it may easily happen that more may merit it; for there is no\nvirtue that so easily spreads as that of military valour.  There is\nanother virtue, true, perfect, and philosophical, of which I do not\nspeak, and only make use of the word in our common acceptation, much\ngreater than this and more full, which is a force and assurance of the\nsoul, equally despising all sorts of adverse accidents, equable, uniform,\nand constant, of which ours is no more than one little ray.  Use,\neducation, example, and custom can do all in all to the establishment of\nthat whereof I am speaking, and with great facility render it common, as\nby the experience of our civil wars is manifest enough; and whoever could\nat this time unite us all, Catholic and Huguenot, into one body, and set\nus upon some brave common enterprise, we should again make our ancient\nmilitary reputation flourish.  It is most certain that in times past the\nrecompense of this order had not only a regard to valour, but had a\nfurther prospect; it never was the reward of a valiant soldier but of a\ngreat captain; the science of obeying was not reputed worthy of so\nhonourable a guerdon.  There was therein a more universal military\nexpertness required, and that comprehended the most and the greatest\nqualities of a military man:\n\n          \u201cNeque enim eaedem militares et imperatorix artes sunt,\u201d\n\n     [\u201cFor the arts of soldiery and generalship are not the same.\u201d\n      --Livy, xxv. 19.]\n\nas also, besides, a condition suitable to such a dignity.  But, I say,\nthough more men were worthy than formerly, yet ought it not to be more\nliberally distributed, and it were better to fall short in not giving it\nat all to whom it should be due, than for ever to lose, as we have lately\ndone, the fruit of so profitable an invention.  No man of spirit will\ndeign to advantage himself with what is in common with many; and such of\nthe present time as have least merited this recompense themselves make\nthe greater show of disdaining it, in order thereby to be ranked with\nthose to whom so much wrong has been done by the unworthy conferring and\ndebasing the distinction which was their particular right.\n\nNow, to expect that in obliterating and abolishing this, suddenly to\ncreate and bring into credit a like institution, is not a proper attempt\nfor so licentious and so sick a time as this wherein we now are; and it\nwill fall out that the last will from its birth incur the same\ninconveniences that have ruined the other.--[Montaigne refers to the\nOrder of the Saint-Esprit, instituted by Henry III.  in 1578.]--The\nrules for dispensing this new order had need to be extremely clipt and\nbound under great restrictions, to give it authority; and this tumultuous\nseason is incapable of such a curb: besides that, before this can be\nbrought into repute, \u2018tis necessary that the memory of the first, and of\nthe contempt into which it is fallen, be buried in oblivion.\n\nThis place might naturally enough admit of some discourse upon the\nconsideration of valour, and the difference of this virtue from others;\nbut, Plutarch having so often handled this subject, I should give myself\nan unnecessary trouble to repeat what he has said.  But this is worth\nconsidering: that our nation places valour, vaillance, in the highest\ndegree of virtue, as its very word evidences, being derived from valeur,\nand that, according to our use, when we say a man of high worth a good\nman, in our court style--\u2018tis to say a valiant man, after the Roman way;\nfor the general appellation of virtue with them takes etymology from vis,\nforce.  The proper, sole, and essential profession of, the French\nnoblesse is that of arms: and \u2018tis likely that the first virtue that\ndiscovered itself amongst men and has given to some advantage over\nothers, was that by which the strongest and most valiant have mastered\nthe weaker, and acquired a particular authority and reputation, whence\ncame to it that dignified appellation; or else, that these nations, being\nvery warlike, gave the pre-eminence to that of the virtues which was most\nfamiliar to them; just as our passion and the feverish solicitude we have\nof the chastity of women occasions that to say, a good woman, a woman of\nworth, a woman of honour and virtue, signifies merely a chaste woman as\nif, to oblige them to that one duty, we were indifferent as to all the\nrest, and gave them the reins in all other faults whatever to compound\nfor that one of incontinence.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nOF THE AFFECTION OF FATHERS TO THEIR CHILDREN\n\nTo Madame D\u2019Estissac.\n\nMADAM, if the strangeness and novelty of my subject, which are wont to\ngive value to things, do not save me, I shall never come off with honour\nfrom this foolish attempt: but \u2018tis so fantastic, and carries a face so\nunlike the common use, that this, peradventure, may make it pass.  \u2018Tis a\nmelancholic humour, and consequently a humour very much an enemy to my\nnatural complexion, engendered by the pensiveness of the solitude into\nwhich for some years past I have retired myself, that first put into\nmy head this idle fancy of writing.  Wherein, finding myself totally\nunprovided and empty of other matter, I presented myself to myself for\nargument and subject.  \u2018Tis the only book in the world of its kind, and\nof a wild and extravagant design.  There is nothing worth remark in this\naffair but that extravagancy: for in a subject so vain and frivolous, the\nbest workman in the world could not have given it a form fit to recommend\nit to any manner of esteem.\n\nNow, madam, having to draw my own picture to the life, I had omitted one\nimportant feature, had I not therein represented the honour I have ever\nhad for you and your merits; which I have purposely chosen to say in the\nbeginning of this chapter, by reason that amongst the many other\nexcellent qualities you are mistress of, that of the tender love you have\nmanifested to your children, is seated in one of the highest places.\nWhoever knows at what age Monsieur D\u2019Estissac, your husband, left you a\nwidow, the great and honourable matches that have since been offered to\nyou, as many as to any lady of your condition in France, the constancy\nand steadiness wherewith, for so many years, you have sustained so many\nsharp difficulties, the burden and conduct of affairs, which have\npersecuted you in every corner of the kingdom, and are not yet weary of\ntormenting you, and the happy direction you have given to all these, by\nyour sole prudence or good fortune, will easily conclude with me that we\nhave not so vivid an example as yours of maternal affection in our times.\nI praise God, madam, that it has been so well employed; for the great\nhopes Monsieur D\u2019Estissac, your son, gives of himself, render sufficient\nassurance that when he comes of age you will reap from him all the\nobedience and gratitude of a very good man.  But, forasmuch as by reason\nof his tender years, he has not been capable of taking notice of those\noffices of extremest value he has in so great number received from you,\nI will, if these papers shall one day happen to fall into his hands, when\nI shall neither have mouth nor speech left to deliver it to him, that he\nshall receive from me a true account of those things, which shall be more\neffectually manifested to him by their own effects, by which he will\nunderstand that there is not a gentleman in France who stands more\nindebted to a mother\u2019s care; and that he cannot, in the future, give a\nbetter nor more certain testimony of his own worth and virtue than by\nacknowledging you for that excellent mother you are.\n\nIf there be any law truly natural, that is to say, any instinct that is\nseen universally and perpetually imprinted in both beasts and men (which\nis not without controversy), I can say, that in my opinion, next to the\ncare every animal has of its own preservation, and to avoid that which\nmay hurt him, the affection that the begetter bears to his offspring\nholds the second place in this rank.  And seeing that nature appears to\nhave recommended it to us, having regard to the extension and progression\nof the successive pieces of this machine of hers, \u2018tis no wonder if, on\nthe contrary, that of children towards their parents is not so great.\nTo which we may add this other Aristotelian consideration, that he who\nconfers a benefit on any one, loves him better than he is beloved by him\nagain: that he to whom is owing, loves better than he who owes; and that\nevery artificer is fonder of his work, than, if that work had sense, it\nwould be of him; by reason that it is dear to us to be, and to be\nconsists in movement and action; therefore every one has in some sort a\nbeing in his work.  He who confers a benefit exercises a fine and honest\naction; he who receives it exercises the useful only.  Now the useful is\nmuch less lovable than the honest; the honest is stable and permanent,\nsupplying him who has done it with a continual gratification.  The useful\nloses itself, easily slides away, and the memory of it is neither so\nfresh nor so pleasing.  Those things are dearest to us that have cost us\nmost, and giving is more chargeable than receiving.\n\nSince it has pleased God to endue us with some capacity of reason, to the\nend we may not, like brutes, be servilely subject and enslaved to the\nlaws common to both, but that we should by judgment and a voluntary\nliberty apply ourselves to them, we ought, indeed, something to yield to\nthe simple authority of nature, but not suffer ourselves to be\ntyrannically hurried away and transported by her; reason alone should\nhave the conduct of our inclinations.  I, for my part, have a strange\ndisgust for those propensions that are started in us without the\nmediation and direction of the judgment, as, upon the subject I am\nspeaking of, I cannot entertain that passion of dandling and caressing\ninfants scarcely born, having as yet neither motion of soul nor shape of\nbody distinguishable, by which they can render themselves amiable, and\nhave not willingly suffered them to be nursed near me.  A true and\nregular affection ought to spring and increase with the knowledge they\ngive us of themselves, and then, if they are worthy of it, the natural\npropension walking hand in hand with reason, to cherish them with a truly\npaternal love; and so to judge, also, if they be otherwise, still\nrendering ourselves to reason, notwithstanding the inclination of nature.\n\u2018Tis oft-times quite otherwise; and, most commonly, we find ourselves\nmore taken with the running up and down, the games, and puerile\nsimplicities of our children, than we do, afterwards, with their most\ncomplete actions; as if we had loved them for our sport, like monkeys,\nand not as men; and some there are, who are very liberal in buying them\nballs to play withal, who are very close-handed for the least necessary\nexpense when they come to age.  Nay, it looks as if the jealousy of\nseeing them appear in and enjoy the world when we are about to leave it,\nrendered us more niggardly and stingy towards them; it vexes us that they\ntread upon our heels, as if to solicit us to go out; if this were to be\nfeared, since the order of things will have it so that they cannot, to\nspeak the truth, be nor live, but at the expense of our being and life,\nwe should never meddle with being fathers at all.\n\nFor my part, I think it cruelty and injustice not to receive them into\nthe share and society of our goods, and not to make them partakers in the\nintelligence of our domestic affairs when they are capable, and not to\nlessen and contract our own expenses to make the more room for theirs,\nseeing we beget them to that effect.  \u2018Tis unjust that an old fellow,\nbroken and half dead, should alone, in a corner of the chimney, enjoy the\nmoney that would suffice for the maintenance and advancement of many\nchildren, and suffer them, in the meantime, to lose their\u2019 best years for\nwant of means to advance themselves in the public service and the\nknowledge of men.  A man by this course drives them to despair, and to\nseek out by any means, how unjust or dishonourable soever, to provide for\ntheir own support: as I have, in my time, seen several young men of good\nextraction so addicted to stealing, that no correction could cure them of\nit.  I know one of a very good family, to whom, at the request of a\nbrother of his, a very honest and brave gentleman, I once spoke on this\naccount, who made answer, and confessed to me roundly, that he had been\nput upon this paltry practice by the severity and avarice of his father;\nbut that he was now so accustomed to it he could not leave it off.  And,\nat that very time, he was trapped stealing a lady\u2019s rings, having come\ninto her chamber, as she was dressing with several others.  He put me in\nmind of a story I had heard of another gentleman, so perfect and\naccomplished in this fine trade in his youth, that, after he came to his\nestate and resolved to give it over, he could not hold his hands,\nnevertheless, if he passed by a shop where he saw anything he liked, from\ncatching it up, though it put him to the shame of sending afterwards to\npay for it.  And I have myself seen several so habituated to this quality\nthat even amongst their comrades they could not forbear filching, though\nwith intent to restore what they had taken.  I am a Gascon, and yet there\nis no vice I so little understand as that; I hate it something more by\ndisposition than I condemn it by reason; I do not so much as desire\nanything of another man\u2019s.  This province of ours is, in plain truth, a\nlittle more decried than the other parts of the kingdom; and yet we have\nseveral times seen, in our times, men of good families of other\nprovinces, in the hands of justice, convicted of abominable thefts.  I\nfear this vice is, in some sort, to be attributed to the fore-mentioned\nvice of the fathers.\n\nAnd if a man should tell me, as a lord of very good understanding once\ndid, that \u201che hoarded up wealth, not to extract any other fruit and use\nfrom his parsimony, but to make himself honoured and sought after by his\nrelations; and that age having deprived him of all other power, it was\nthe only remaining remedy to maintain his authority in his family, and to\nkeep him from being neglected and despised by all around,\u201d in truth, not\nonly old age, but all other imbecility, according to Aristotle, is the\npromoter of avarice; that is something, but it is physic for a disease\nthat a man should prevent the birth of.  A father is very miserable who\nhas no other hold on his children\u2019s affection than the need they have of\nhis assistance, if that can be called affection; he must render himself\nworthy to be respected by his virtue and wisdom, and beloved by his\nkindness and the sweetness of his manners; even the very ashes of a rich\nmatter have their value; and we are wont to have the bones and relics of\nworthy men in regard and reverence.  No old age can be so decrepid in a\nman who has passed his life in honour, but it must be venerable,\nespecially to his children, whose soul he must have trained up to their\nduty by reason, not by necessity and the need they have of him, nor by\nharshness and compulsion:\n\n         \u201cEt errat longe mea quidem sententia\n          Qui imperium credat esse gravius, aut stabilius,\n          Vi quod fit, quam illud, quod amicitia adjungitur.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cHe wanders far from the truth, in my opinion, who thinks that\n     government more absolute and durable which is acquired by force than\n     that which is attached to friendship.\u201d--Terence, Adelph., i. I, 40.]\n\nI condemn all violence in the education of a tender soul that is designed\nfor honour and liberty.  There is I know not what of servile in rigour\nand constraint; and I am of opinion that what is not to be done by\nreason, prudence, and address, is never to be affected by force.  I\nmyself was brought up after that manner; and they tell me that in all my\nfirst age I never felt the rod but twice, and then very slightly.  I\npractised the same method with my children, who all of them died at\nnurse, except Leonora, my only daughter, and who arrived to the age of\nfive years and upward without other correction for her childish faults\n(her mother\u2019s indulgence easily concurring) than words only, and those\nvery gentle; in which kind of proceeding, though my end and expectation\nshould be both frustrated, there are other causes enough to lay the fault\non without blaming my discipline, which I know to be natural and just,\nand I should, in this, have yet been more religious towards the males, as\nless born to subjection and more free; and I should have made it my\nbusiness to fill their hearts with ingenuousness and freedom.  I have\nnever observed other effects of whipping than to render boys more\ncowardly, or more wilfully obstinate.\n\nDo we desire to be beloved of our children?  Will we remove from them all\noccasion of wishing our death though no occasion of so horrid a wish can\neither be just or excusable?\n\n                    \u201cNullum scelus rationem habet.\u201d\n\n               [\u201cNo wickedness has reason.\u201d--Livy, xxviii. 28]\n\nLet us reasonably accommodate their lives with what is in our power.  In\norder to this, we should not marry so young that our age shall in a\nmanner be confounded with theirs; for this inconvenience plunges us into\nmany very great difficulties, and especially the gentry of the nation,\nwho are of a condition wherein they have little to do, and who live upon\ntheir rents only: for elsewhere, with people who live by their labour,\nthe plurality and company of children is an increase to the common stock;\nthey are so many new tools and instruments wherewith to grow rich.\n\nI married at three-and-thirty years of age, and concur in the opinion of\nthirty-five, which is said to be that of Aristotle.   Plato will have\nnobody marry before thirty; but he has reason to laugh at those who\nundertook the work of marriage after five-and-fifty, and condemns their\noffspring as unworthy of aliment and life.  Thales gave the truest\nlimits, who, young and being importuned by his mother to marry, answered,\n\u201cThat it was too soon,\u201d and, being grown into years and urged again,\n\u201cThat it was too late.\u201d  A man must deny opportunity to every inopportune\naction.  The ancient Gauls\u2019 looked upon it as a very horrid thing for a\nman to have society with a woman before he was twenty years of age, and\nstrictly recommended to the men who designed themselves for war the\nkeeping their virginity till well grown in years, forasmuch as courage is\nabated and diverted by intercourse with women:\n\n              \u201cMa, or congiunto a giovinetta sposa,\n               E lieto omai de\u2019 figli, era invilito\n               Negli affetti di padre et di marito.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cNow, married to a young wife and happy in children, he was\n     demoralised by his love as father and husband.\u201d\n      --Tasso, Gierus., x. 39.]\n\nMuley Hassam, king of Tunis, he whom the Emperor Charles V. restored to\nhis kingdom, reproached the memory of his father Mahomet with the\nfrequentation of women, styling him loose, effeminate, and a getter of\nchildren.--[Of whom he had thirty-four.]--The Greek history observes of\nIccus the Tarentine, of Chryso, Astyllus, Diopompos, and others, that to\nkeep their bodies in order for the Olympic games and such like exercises,\nthey denied themselves during that preparation all commerce with Venus.\nIn a certain country of the Spanish Indies men were not permitted to\nmarry till after forty age, and yet the girls were allowed at ten.\n\u2018Tis not time for a gentleman of thirty years old to give place to his\nson who is twenty; he is himself in a condition to serve both in the\nexpeditions of war and in the court of his prince; has need of all his\nappurtenances; and yet, doubtless, he ought to surrender a share, but not\nso great an one as to forget himself for others; and for such an one the\nanswer that fathers have ordinarily in their mouths, \u201cI will not put off\nmy clothes, before I go to bed,\u201d serves well.\n\nBut a father worn out with age and infirmities, and deprived by weakness\nand want of health of the common society of men, wrongs himself and his\nto amass a great heap of treasure.  He has lived long enough, if he be\nwise, to have a mind to strip himself to go to bed, not to his very\nshirt, I confess, but to that and a good, warm dressing-gown; the\nremaining pomps, of which he has no further use, he ought voluntarily to\nsurrender to those, to whom by the order of nature they belong.  \u2018Tis\nreason he should refer the use of those things to them, seeing that\nnature has reduced him to such a state that he cannot enjoy them himself;\notherwise there is doubtless malice and envy in the case.  The greatest\nact of the Emperor Charles V. was that when, in imitation of some of the\nancients of his own quality, confessing it but reason to strip ourselves\nwhen our clothes encumber and grow too heavy for us, and to lie down when\nour legs begin to fail us, he resigned his possessions, grandeur, and\npower to his son, when he found himself failing in vigour, and steadiness\nfor the conduct of his affairs suitable with the glory he had therein\nacquired:\n\n          \u201cSolve senescentem mature sanus equum, ne\n          Peccet ad extremum ridendus, et ilia ducat.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cDismiss the old horse in good time, lest, failing in the lists,\n     the spectators laugh.\u201d--Horace, Epist., i., I, 8.]\n\nThis fault of not perceiving betimes and of not being sensible of the\nfeebleness and extreme alteration that age naturally brings both upon\nbody and mind, which, in my opinion, is equal, if indeed the soul has not\nmore than half, has lost the reputation of most of the great men in the\nworld.  I have known in my time, and been intimately acquainted with\npersons of great authority, whom one might easily discern marvellously\nlapsed from the sufficiency I knew they were once endued with, by the\nreputation they had acquired in their former years, whom I could\nheartily, for their own sakes, have wished at home at their ease,\ndischarged of their public or military employments, which were now grown\ntoo heavy for their shoulders.  I have formerly been very familiar in a\ngentleman\u2019s house, a widower and very old, though healthy and cheerful\nenough: this gentleman had several daughters to marry and a son already\nof ripe age, which brought upon him many visitors, and a great expense,\nneither of which well pleased him, not only out of consideration of\nfrugality, but yet more for having, by reason of his age, entered into a\ncourse of life far differing from ours.  I told him one day a little\nboldly, as I used to do, that he would do better to give us younger folk\nroom, and to leave his principal house (for he had but that well placed\nand furnished) to his son, and himself retire to an estate he had hard\nby, where nobody would trouble his repose, seeing he could not otherwise\navoid being importuned by us, the condition of his children considered.\nHe took my advice afterwards, and found an advantage in so doing.\n\nI do not mean that a man should so instal them as not to reserve to\nhimself a liberty to retract; I, who am now arrived to the age wherein\nsuch things are fit to be done, would resign to them the enjoyment of my\nhouse and goods, but with a power of revocation if they should give me\ncause to alter my mind; I would leave to them the use, that being no\nlonger convenient for me; and, of the general authority and power over\nall, would reserve as much as--I thought good to myself; having always\nheld that it must needs be a great satisfaction to an aged father himself\nto put his children into the way of governing his affairs, and to have\npower during his own life to control their behaviour, supplying them with\ninstruction and advice from his own experience, and himself to transfer\nthe ancient honour and order of his house into the hands of those who are\nto succeed him, and by that means to satisfy himself as to the hopes he\nmay conceive of their future conduct.  And in order to this I would not\navoid their company; I would observe them near at hand, and partake,\naccording to the condition of my age, of their feasts and jollities.\nIf I did not live absolutely amongst them, which I could not do without\nannoying them and their friends, by reason of the morosity of my age and\nthe restlessness of my infirmities, and without violating also the rules\nand order of living I should then have set down to myself, I would, at\nleast, live near them in some retired part of my house, not the best in\nshow, but the most commodious.  Nor as I saw some years ago, a dean of\nSt. Hilary of Poitiers given up to such a solitude, that at the time I\ncame into his chamber it had been two and twenty years that he had not\nstepped one foot out of it, and yet had all his motions free and easy,\nand was in good health, saving a cold that fell upon his lungs; he would,\nhardly once in a week, suffer any one to come in to see him; he always\nkept himself shut up in his chamber alone, except that a servant brought\nhim, once a day, something to eat, and did then but just come in and go\nout again.  His employment was to walk up and down, and read some book,\nfor he was a bit of a scholar; but, as to the rest, obstinately bent to\ndie in this retirement, as he soon after did.  I would endeavour by\npleasant conversation to create in my children a warm and unfeigned\nfriendship and good-will towards me, which in well-descended natures is\nnot hard to do; for if they be furious brutes, of which this age of ours\nproduces thousands, we are then to hate and avoid them as such.\n\nI am angry at the custom of forbidding children to call their father by\nthe name of father, and to enjoin them another, as more full of respect\nand reverence, as if nature had not sufficiently provided for our\nauthority.  We call Almighty God Father, and disdain to have our children\ncall us so; I have reformed this error in my family.--[As did Henry IV.\nof France]--And \u2018tis also folly and injustice to deprive children, when\ngrown up, of familiarity with their father, and to carry a scornful and\naustere countenance toward them, thinking by that to keep them in awe and\nobedience; for it is a very idle farce that, instead of producing the\neffect designed, renders fathers distasteful, and, which is worse,\nridiculous to their own children.  They have youth and vigour in\npossession, and consequently the breath and favour of the world; and\ntherefore receive these fierce and tyrannical looks--mere scarecrows--\nof a man without blood, either in his heart or veins, with mockery and\ncontempt.  Though I could make myself feared, I had yet much rather make\nmyself beloved: there are so many sorts of defects in old age, so much\nimbecility, and it is so liable to contempt, that the best acquisition a\nman can make is the kindness and affection of his own family; command and\nfear are no longer his weapons.  Such an one I have known who, having\nbeen very imperious in his youth, when he came to be old, though he might\nhave lived at his full ease, would ever strike, rant, swear, and curse:\nthe most violent householder in France: fretting himself with unnecessary\nsuspicion and vigilance.  And all this rumble and clutter but to make his\nfamily cheat him the more; of his barn, his kitchen, cellar, nay, and his\nvery purse too, others had the greatest use and share, whilst he keeps\nhis keys in his pocket much more carefully than his eyes.  Whilst he hugs\nhimself with the pitiful frugality of a niggard table, everything goes to\nrack and ruin in every corner of his house, in play, drink, all sorts of\nprofusion, making sport in their junkets with his vain anger and\nfruitless parsimony.  Every one is a sentinel against him, and if, by\naccident, any wretched fellow that serves him is of another humour, and\nwill not join with the rest, he is presently rendered suspected to him,\na bait that old age very easily bites at of itself.  How often has this\ngentleman boasted to me in how great awe he kept his family, and how\nexact an obedience and reverence they paid him!  How clearly he saw into\nhis own affairs!\n\n                    \u201cIlle solos nescit omnia.\u201d\n\n          [\u201cHe alone is ignorant of all that is passing.\u201d\n           --Terence, Adelph., iv.  2, 9.]\n\nI do not know any one that can muster more parts, both natural and\nacquired, proper to maintain dominion, than he; yet he is fallen from it\nlike a child.  For this reason it is that I have picked out him, amongst\nseveral others that I know of the same humour, for the greatest example.\nIt were matter for a question in the schools, whether he is better thus\nor otherwise.  In his presence, all submit to and bow to him, and give so\nmuch way to his vanity that nobody ever resists him; he has his fill of\nassents, of seeming fear, submission, and respect.  Does he turn away a\nservant? he packs up his bundle, and is gone; but \u2018tis no further than\njust out of his sight: the steps of old age are so slow, the senses so\ntroubled, that he will live and do his old office in the same house a\nyear together without being perceived.\n\nAnd after a fit interval of time, letters are pretended to come from a\ngreat way off; very humble, suppliant; and full of promises of amendment,\nby virtue of which he is again received into favour.  Does Monsieur make\nany bargain, or prepare any despatch that does not please? \u2018tis\nsuppressed, and causes afterwards forged to excuse the want of execution\nin the one or answer in the other.  No letters being first brought to\nhim, he never sees any but those that shall seem fit for his knowledge.\nIf by accident they fall first into his own hand, being used to trust\nsomebody to read them to him; he reads extempore what he thinks fit, and\noften makes such a one ask him pardon who abuses and rails at him in his\nletter.  In short, he sees nothing, but by an image prepared and designed\nbeforehand and the most satisfactory they can invent, not to rouse and\nawaken his ill humour and choler.  I have seen, under various aspects,\nenough of these modes of domestic government, long-enduring, constant, to\nthe like effect.\n\nWomen  are evermore addicted to cross their husbands: they lay hold with\nboth hands on all occasions to contradict and oppose them; the first\nexcuse serves for a plenary justification.  I have seen one who robbed\nher husband wholesale, that, as she told her confessor, she might\ndistribute the more liberal alms.  Let who will trust to that religious\ndispensation.  No management of affairs seems to them of sufficient\ndignity, if proceeding from the husband\u2019s assent; they must usurp it\neither by insolence or cunning, and always injuriously, or else it has\nnot the grace and authority they desire.  When, as in the case I am\nspeaking of, \u2018tis against a poor old man and for the children, then they\nmake use of this title to serve their passion with glory; and, as for a\ncommon service, easily cabal, and combine against his government and\ndominion.  If they be males grown up in full and flourishing health, they\npresently corrupt, either by force or favour, steward, receivers, and all\nthe rout.  Such as have neither wife nor son do not so easily fall into\nthis misfortune; but withal more cruelly and unworthily.  Cato the elder\nin his time said: So many servants, so many enemies; consider, then,\nwhether according to the vast difference between the purity of the age he\nlived in and the corruption of this of ours, he does not seem to shew us\nthat wife, son, and servant, are so many enemies to us?  \u2018Tis well for\nold age that it is always accompanied by want of observation, ignorance,\nand a proneness to being deceived. For should we see how we are used and\nwould not acquiesce, what would become of us?  especially in such an age\nas this, where the very judges who are to determine our controversies are\nusually partisans to the young, and interested in the cause. In case the\ndiscovery of this cheating escape me, I cannot at least fail to discern\nthat I am very fit to be cheated.  And can a man ever enough exalt the\nvalue of a friend, in comparison with these civil ties?  The very image\nof it which I see in beasts, so pure and uncorrupted, how religiously do\nI respect it!  If others deceive me, yet do I not, at least, deceive\nmyself in thinking I am able to defend myself from them, or in cudgelling\nmy brains to make myself so.  I protect myself from such treasons in my\nown bosom, not by an unquiet and tumultuous curiosity, but rather by\ndiversion and resolution.  When I hear talk of any one\u2019s condition, I\nnever trouble myself to think of him; I presently turn my eyes upon\nmyself to see in what condition I am; whatever concerns another relates\nto me; the accident that has befallen him gives me caution, and rouses me\nto turn my defence that way.  We every day and every hour say things of\nanother that we might properly say of ourselves, could we but apply our\nobservation to our own concerns, as well as extend it to others.  And\nseveral authors have in this manner prejudiced their own cause by running\nheadlong upon those they attack, and darting those shafts against their\nenemies, that are more properly, and with greater advantage, to be turned\nupon themselves.\n\nThe late Mareschal de Montluc having lost his son, who died in the island\nof Madeira, in truth a very worthy gentleman and of great expectation,\ndid to me, amongst his other regrets, very much insist upon what a sorrow\nand heart-breaking it was that he had never made himself familiar with\nhim; and by that humour of paternal gravity and grimace to have lost the\nopportunity of having an insight into and of well knowing, his son, as\nalso of letting him know the extreme affection he had for him, and the\nworthy opinion he had of his virtue.  \u201cThat poor boy,\u201d said he, \u201cnever\nsaw in me other than a stern and disdainful countenance, and is gone in a\nbelief that I neither knew how to love him nor esteem him according to\nhis desert.  For whom did I reserve the discovery of that singular\naffection I had for him in my soul?  Was it not he himself, who ought to\nhave had all the pleasure of it, and all the obligation?  I constrained\nand racked myself to put on, and maintain this vain disguise, and have by\nthat means deprived myself of the pleasure of his conversation, and, I\ndoubt, in some measure, his affection, which could not but be very cold\nto me, having never other from me than austerity, nor felt other than a\ntyrannical manner of proceeding.\u201d\n\n     [Madame de Sevigne tells us that she never read this passage without\n     tears in her eyes.  \u201cMy God!\u201d she exclaims, \u201chow full is this book\n     of good sense!\u201d  Ed.]\n\nI find this complaint to be rational and rightly apprehended: for, as I\nmyself know by too certain experience, there is no so sweet consolation\nin the loss of friends as the conscience of having had no reserve or\nsecret for them, and to have had with them a perfect and entire\ncommunication.  Oh my friend,--[La Boetie.] am I the better for being\nsensible of this; or am I the worse?  I am, doubtless, much the better.\nI am consoled and honoured, in the sorrow for his death.  Is it not a\npious and a pleasing office of my life to be always upon my friend\u2019s\nobsequies?  Can there be any joy equal to this privation?\n\nI open myself to my family, as much as I can, and very willingly let them\nknow the state of my opinion and good will towards them, as I do to\neverybody else: I make haste to bring out and present myself to them; for\nI will not have them mistaken in me, in anything.  Amongst other\nparticular customs of our ancient Gauls, this, as Caesar reports,--[De\nBello Gall., vi.  r8.]--was one, that the sons never presented\nthemselves before their fathers, nor durst ever appear in their company\nin public, till they began to bear arms; as if they would intimate by\nthis, that it was also time for their fathers to receive them into their\nfamiliarity and acquaintance.\n\nI have observed yet another sort of indiscretion in fathers of my time,\nthat, not contented with having deprived their children, during their own\nlong lives, of the share they naturally ought to have had in their\nfortunes, they afterwards leave to their wives the same authority over\ntheir estates, and liberty to dispose of them according to their own\nfancy.  And I have known a certain lord, one of the principal officers of\nthe crown, who, having in reversion above fifty thousand crowns yearly\nrevenue, died necessitous and overwhelmed with debt at above fifty years\nof age; his mother in her extremest decrepitude being yet in possession\nof all his property by the will of his father, who had, for his part,\nlived till near fourscore years old.  This appears to me by no means\nreasonable.  And therefore I think it of very little advantage to a man,\nwhose affairs are well enough, to seek a wife who encumbers his estate\nwith a very great fortune; there is no sort of foreign debt that brings\nmore ruin to families than this: my predecessors have ever been aware of\nthat danger and provided against it, and so have I.  But those who\ndissuade us from rich wives, for fear they should be less tractable and\nkind, are out in their advice to make a man lose a real commodity for so\nfrivolous a conjecture.  It costs an unreasonable woman no more to pass\nover one reason than another; they cherish themselves most where they are\nmost wrong.  Injustice allures them, as the honour of their virtuous\nactions does the good; and the more riches they bring with them, they are\nso much the more good-natured, as women, who are handsome, are all the\nmore inclined and proud to be chaste.\n\n\u2018Tis reasonable to leave the administration of affairs to the mothers,\ntill the children are old enough, according to law, to manage them; but\nthe father has brought them, up very ill, if he cannot hope that, when\nthey come to maturity, they will have more wisdom and ability in the\nmanagement of affairs than his wife, considering the ordinary weakness of\nthe sex.  It were, notwithstanding, to say the truth, more against nature\nto make the mothers depend upon the discretion of their children; they\nought to be plentifully provided for, to maintain themselves according to\ntheir quality and age, by reason that necessity and indigence are much\nmore unbecoming and insupportable to them than to men; the son should\nrather be cut short than the mother.\n\nIn general, the most judicious distribution of our goods, when we come to\ndie, is, in my opinion, to let them be distributed according to the\ncustom of the country; the laws have considered the matter better than we\nknow how to do, and \u2018tis wiser to let them fail in their appointment,\nthan rashly to run the hazard of miscarrying in ours.  Nor are the goods\nproperly ours, since, by civil prescription and without us, they are all\ndestined to certain successors.  And although we have some liberty beyond\nthat, yet I think we ought not, without great and manifest cause, to take\naway that from one which his fortune has allotted him, and to which the\npublic equity gives him title; and that it is against reason to abuse\nthis liberty, in making it serve our own frivolous and private fancies.\nMy destiny has been kind to me in not presenting me with occasions to\ntempt me and divert my affection from the common and legitimate\ninstitution.  I see many with whom \u2018tis time lost to employ a long\nexercise of good offices: a word ill taken obliterates ten years\u2019 merit;\nhe is happy who is in a position to oil their goodwill at this last\npassage.  The last action carries it, not the best and most frequent\noffices, but the most recent and present do the work.  These are people\nthat play with their wills as with apples or rods, to gratify or chastise\nevery action of those who pretend to an interest in their care.  \u2018Tis a\nthing of too great weight and consequence to be so tumbled and tossed and\naltered every moment, and wherein the wise determine once for all, having\nabove all things regard to reason and the public observance.  We lay\nthese masculine substitutions too much to heart, proposing a ridiculous\neternity to our names.  We are, moreover, too superstitious in vain\nconjectures as to the future, that we derive from the words and actions\nof children.  Peradventure they might have done me an injustice, in\ndispossessing me of my right, for having been the most dull and heavy,\nthe most slow and unwilling at my book, not of all my brothers only, but\nof all the boys in the whole province: whether about learning my lesson,\nor about any bodily exercise.  \u2018Tis a folly to make an election out of\nthe ordinary course upon the credit of these divinations wherein we are\nso often deceived.  If the ordinary rule of descent were to be violated,\nand the destinies corrected in the choice they have made of our heirs,\none might more plausibly do it upon the account of some remarkable and\nenormous personal deformity, a permanent and incorrigible defect, and in\nthe opinion of us French, who are great admirers of beauty, an important\nprejudice.\n\nThe pleasant dialogue betwixt Plato\u2019s legislator and his citizens will be\nan ornament to this place, \u201cWhat,\u201d said they, feeling themselves about to\ndie, \u201cmay we not dispose of our own to whom we please?  God!  what\ncruelty that it shall not be lawful for us, according as we have been\nserved and attended in our sickness, in our old age, in our affairs, to\ngive more or less to those whom we have found most diligent about us, at\nour own fancy and discretion!\u201d  To which the legislator answers thus:\n\n\u201cMy friends, who are now, without question, very soon to die, it is hard\nfor you in the condition you are, either to know yourselves, or what is\nyours, according to the delphic inscription.  I, who make the laws, am of\nopinion, that you neither are yourselves your own, nor is that yours of\nwhich you are possessed.  Both your goods and you belong to your\nfamilies, as well those past as those to come; but, further, both your\nfamily and goods much more appertain to the public.  Wherefore, lest any\nflatterer in your old age or in your sickness, or any passion of your\nown, should unseasonably prevail with you to make an unjust will, I shall\ntake care to prevent that inconvenience; but, having respect both to the\nuniversal interests of the city and that of your particular family, I\nshall establish laws, and make it by good reasons appear, that private\nconvenience ought to give place to the common benefit.  Go then\ncheerfully where human necessity calls you.  It is for me, who regard no\nmore the one thing than the other, and who, as much as in me lies, am\nprovident of the public interest, to have a care as to what you leave\nbehind you.\u201d\n\nTo return to my subject: it appears to me that women are very rarely\nborn, to whom the prerogative over men, the maternal and natural\nexcepted, is in any sort due, unless it be for the punishment of such,\nas in some amorous fever have voluntarily submitted themselves to them:\nbut that in no way concerns the old ones, of whom we are now speaking.\nThis consideration it is which has made us so willingly to enact and give\nforce to that law, which was never yet seen by any one, by which women\nare excluded the succession to our crown: and there is hardly a\ngovernment in the world where it is not pleaded, as it is here, by the\nprobability of reason that authorises it, though fortune has given it\nmore credit in some places than in others.  \u2018Tis dangerous to leave the\ndisposal of our succession to their judgment, according to the choice\nthey shall make of children, which is often fantastic and unjust; for the\nirregular appetites and depraved tastes they have during the time of\ntheir being with child, they have at all other times in the mind.  We\ncommonly see them fond of the most weak, ricketty, and deformed children;\nor of those, if they have such, as are still hanging at the breast.  For,\nnot having sufficient force of reason to choose and embrace that which is\nmost worthy, they the more willingly suffer themselves to be carried\naway, where the impressions of nature are most alone; like animals that\nknow their young no longer than they give them suck.  As to the rest, it\nis easy by experience to be discerned that this natural affection to\nwhich we give so great authority has but very weak roots.  For a very\nlittle profit, we every day tear their own children out of the mothers\u2019\narms, and make them take ours in their room: we make them abandon their\nown to some pitiful nurse, to whom we disdain to commit ours, or to some\nshe-goat, forbidding them, not only to give them suck, what danger soever\nthey run thereby, but, moreover, to take any manner of care of them, that\nthey may wholly be occupied with the care of and attendance upon ours;\nand we see in most of them an adulterate affection, more vehement than\nthe natural, begotten by custom toward the foster children, and a greater\nsolicitude for the preservation of those they have taken charge of, than\nof their own.  And that which I was saying of goats was upon this\naccount; that it is ordinary all about where I live, to see the\ncountrywomen, when they want milk of their own for their children, to\ncall goats to their assistance; and I have at this hour two men-servants\nthat never sucked women\u2019s milk more than eight days after they were born.\nThese goats are immediately taught to come to suckle the little children,\nknow their voices when they cry, and come running to them.  If any other\nthan this foster-child be presented to them, they refuse to let it suck;\nand the child in like manner will refuse to suck another goat.  I saw one\nthe other day from whom they had taken away the goat that used to nourish\nit, by reason the father had only borrowed it of a neighbour; the child\nwould not touch any other they could bring, and died, doubtless of\nhunger.  Beasts as easily alter and corrupt their natural affection as\nwe: I believe that in what Herodotus relates of a certain district of\nLybia, there are many mistakes; he says that the women are there in\ncommon; but that the child, so soon as it can go, finds him out in the\ncrowd for his father, to whom he is first led by his natural inclination.\n\nNow, to consider this simple reason for loving our children, that we have\nbegot them, therefore calling them our second selves, it appears,\nmethinks, that there is another kind of production proceeding from us,\nthat is of no less recommendation: for that which we engender by the\nsoul, the issue of our understanding, courage, and abilities, springs\nfrom nobler parts than those of the body, and that are much more our own:\nwe are both father and mother in this generation.  These cost us a great\ndeal more and bring us more honour, if they have anything of good in\nthem.  For the value of our other children is much more theirs than ours;\nthe share we have in them is very little; but of these all the beauty,\nall the grace and value, are ours; and also they more vividly represent\nus than the others.  Plato adds, that these are immortal children that\nimmortalise and deify their fathers, as Lycurgus, Solon, Minos.  Now,\nhistories being full of examples of the common affection of fathers to\ntheir children, it seems not altogether improper to introduce some few of\nthis other kind.  Heliodorus, that good bishop of Trikka, rather chose to\nlose the dignity, profit, and devotion of so venerable a prelacy, than to\nlose his daughter; a daughter that continues to this day very graceful\nand comely; but, peradventure, a little too curiously and wantonly\ntricked, and too amorous for an ecclesiastical and sacerdotal daughter.\nThere was one Labienus at Rome, a man of great worth and authority, and\namongst other qualities excellent in all sorts of literature, who was, as\nI take it, the son of that great Labienus, the chief of Caesar\u2019s captains\nin the wars of Gaul; and who, afterwards, siding with Pompey the great,\nso valiantly maintained his cause, till he was by Caesar defeated in\nSpain.  This Labienus, of whom I am now speaking, had several enemies,\nenvious of his good qualities, and, tis likely, the courtiers and minions\nof the emperors of his time who were very angry at his freedom and the\npaternal humour which he yet retained against tyranny, with which it is\nto be supposed he had tinctured his books and writings.  His adversaries\nprosecuted several pieces he had published before the magistrates at\nRome, and prevailed so far against him, as to have them condemned to the\nfire.  It was in him that this new example of punishment was begun, which\nwas afterwards continued against others at Rome, to punish even writing\nand studies with death.  There would not be means and matter enough of\ncruelty, did we not mix with them things that nature has exempted from\nall sense and suffering, as reputation and the products of the mind, and\ndid we not communicate corporal punishments to the teachings and\nmonuments of the Muses.  Now, Labienus could not suffer this loss, nor\nsurvive these his so dear issue, and therefore caused himself to be\nconveyed and shut up alive in the monument of his ancestors, where he\nmade shift to kill and bury himself at once.  \u2018Tis hard to shew a more\nvehement paternal affection than this.  Cassius Severus, a man of great\neloquence and his very intimate friend, seeing his books burned, cried\nout that by the same sentence they should as well condemn him to the fire\ntoo, seeing that he carried in his memory all that they contained.  The\nlike accident befel Cremutius Cordus, who being accused of having in his\nbooks commended Brutus and Cassius, that dirty, servile, and corrupt\nSenate, worthy a worse master than Tiberius, condemned his writings to\nthe flame.  He was willing to bear them company, and killed himself with\nfasting.  The good Lucan, being condemned by that rascal Nero, at the\nlast gasp of his life, when the greater part of his blood was already\nspent through the veins of his arms, which he had caused his physician to\nopen to make him die, and when the cold had seized upon all his\nextremities, and began to approach his vital parts, the last thing he had\nin his memory was some of the verses of his Battle of Phaysalia, which he\nrecited, dying with them in his mouth.  What was this, but taking a\ntender and paternal leave of his children, in imitation of the\nvaledictions and embraces, wherewith we part from ours, when we come to\ndie, and an effect of that natural inclination, that suggests to our\nremembrance in this extremity those things which were dearest to us\nduring the time of our life?\n\nCan we believe that Epicurus who, as he says himself, dying of the\nintolerable pain of the stone, had all his consolation in the beauty of\nthe doctrine he left behind him, could have received the same\nsatisfaction from many children, though never so well-conditioned and\nbrought up, had he had them, as he did from the production of so many\nrich writings?  Or that, had it been in his choice to have left behind\nhim a deformed and untoward child or a foolish and ridiculous book, he,\nor any other man of his understanding, would not rather have chosen to\nhave run the first misfortune than the other?  It had been, for example,\nperadventure, an impiety in St. Augustin, if, on the one hand, it had\nbeen proposed to him to bury his writings, from which religion has\nreceived so great fruit, or on the other to bury his children, had he had\nthem, had he not rather chosen to bury his children.  And I know not\nwhether I had not much rather have begot a very beautiful one, through\nsociety with the Muses, than by lying with my wife.  To this, such as it\nis, what I give it I give absolutely and irrevocably, as men do to their\nbodily children.  That little I have done for it, is no more at my own\ndisposal; it may know many things that are gone from me, and from me hold\nthat which I have not retained; and which, as well as a stranger, I\nshould borrow thence, should I stand in need.  If I am wiser than my\nbook, it is richer than I.  There are few men addicted to poetry, who\nwould not be much prouder to be the father to the AEneid than to the\nhandsomest youth of Rome; and who would not much better bear the loss of\nthe one than of the other.  For according to Aristotle, the poet, of all\nartificers, is the fondest of his work.  \u2018Tis hard to believe that\nEpaminondas, who boasted that in lieu of all posterity he left two\ndaughters behind him that would one day do their father honour (meaning\nthe two victories he obtained over the Lacedaemonians), would willingly\nhave consented to exchange these for the most beautiful creatures of all\nGreece; or that Alexander or Caesar ever wished to be deprived of the\ngrandeur of their glorious exploits in war, for the convenience of\nchildren and heirs, how perfect and accomplished soever.  Nay, I make a\ngreat question, whether Phidias or any other excellent sculptor would be\nso solicitous of the preservation and continuance of his natural\nchildren, as he would be of a rare statue, which with long labour and\nstudy he had perfected according to art.  And to those furious and\nirregular passions that have sometimes inflamed fathers towards their own\ndaughters, and mothers towards their own sons, the like is also found in\nthis other sort of parentage: witness what is related of Pygmalion who,\nhaving made the statue of a woman of singular beauty, fell so\npassionately in love with this work of his, that the gods in favour of\nhis passion inspired it with life.\n\n              \u201cTentatum mollescit ebur, positoque rigore,\n               Subsidit digitis.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThe ivory grows soft under his touch and yields to his fingers.\u201d\n      --Ovid, Metam., x. 283.]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nOF THE ARMS OF THE PARTHIANS\n\n\u2018Tis an ill custom and unmanly that the gentlemen of our time have got,\nnot to put on arms but just upon the point of the most extreme necessity,\nand to lay them by again, so soon as ever there is any show of the danger\nbeing over; hence many disorders arise; for every one bustling and\nrunning to his arms just when he should go to charge, has his cuirass to\nbuckle on when his companions are already put to rout.  Our ancestors\nwere wont to give their head-piece, lance and gauntlets to be carried,\nbut never put off the other pieces so long as there was any work to be\ndone.  Our troops are now cumbered and rendered unsightly with the\nclutter of baggage and servants who cannot be from their masters, by\nreason they carry their arms.  Titus Livius speaking of our nation:\n\n     \u201cIntolerantissima laboris corpora vix arma humeris gerebant.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cBodies most impatient of labour could scarce endure to wear\n     their arms on their shoulders.\u201d--Livy, x. 28.]\n\nMany nations do yet, and did anciently, go to war without defensive arms,\nor with such, at least, as were of very little proof:\n\n          \u201cTegmina queis capitum, raptus de subere cortex.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cTo whom the coverings of the heads were the bark of the\n     cork-tree.\u201d--AEneid, vii. 742.]\n\nAlexander, the most adventurous captain that ever was, very seldom wore\narmour, and such amongst us as slight it, do not by that much harm to the\nmain concern; for if we see some killed for want of it, there are few\nless whom the lumber of arms helps to destroy, either by being\noverburthened, crushed, and cramped with their weight, by a rude shock,\nor otherwise.  For, in plain truth, to observe the weight and thickness\nof the armour we have now in use, it seems as if we only sought to defend\nourselves, and are rather loaded than secured by it.  We have enough to\ndo to support its weight, being so manacled and immured, as if we were\nonly to contend with our own arms, and as if we had not the same\nobligation to defend them, that they have to defend us.  Tacitus gives a\npleasant description of the men-at-arms among our ancient Gauls, who were\nso armed as only to be able to stand, without power to harm or to be\nharmed, or to rise again if once struck down.  Lucullus, seeing certain\nsoldiers of the Medes, who formed the van of Tigranes\u2019 army, heavily\narmed and very uneasy, as if in prisons of iron, thence conceived hopes\nwith great ease to defeat them, and by them began his charge and victory.\nAnd now that our musketeers are in credit, I believe some invention will\nbe found out to immure us for our safety, and to draw us to the war in\ncastles, such as those the ancients loaded their elephants withal.\n\nThis humour is far differing from that of the younger Scipio, who sharply\nreprehended his soldiers for having planted caltrops under water, in a\nditch by which those of the town he held besieged might sally out upon\nhim; saying, that those who assaulted should think of attacking, and not\nto fear; suspecting, with good reason, that this stop they had put to the\nenemies, would make themselves less vigilant upon their guard.  He said\nalso to a young man, who showed him a fine buckler he had, that he was\nvery proud of, \u201cIt is a very fine buckler indeed, but a Roman soldier\nought to repose greater confidence in his right hand than in his left.\u201d\n\nNow \u2018tis nothing but the not being used to wear it that makes the weight\nof our armour so intolerable:\n\n         \u201cL\u2019usbergo in dosso haveano, et l\u2019elmo in testa,\n          Due di questi guerrier, de\u2019 quali io canto;\n          Ne notte o di, d\u2019 appoi ch\u2019 entraro in questa\n          Stanza, gl\u2019haveano mai messi da canto;\n          Che facile a portar come la vesta\n          Era lor, perche in uso l\u2019havean tanto:\u201d\n\n     [\u201cTwo of the warriors, of whom I sing, had on their backs their\n     cuirass and on their heads their casque, and never had night or day\n     once laid them by, whilst here they were; those arms, by long\n     practice, were grown as light to bear as a garment\u201d\n      --Ariosto, Cant., MI. 30.]\n\nthe Emperor Caracalla was wont to march on foot, completely armed, at the\nhead of his army.  The Roman infantry always carried not only a morion, a\nsword, and a shield (for as to arms, says Cicero, they were so accustomed\nto have them always on, that they were no more trouble to them than their\nown limbs):\n\n               \u201cArma enim membra militis esse dicunt.\u201d\n\nbut, moreover, fifteen days\u2019 provision, together with a certain number of\nstakes, wherewith to fortify their camp, sixty pounds in weight.  And\nMarius\u2019 soldiers, laden at the same rate, were inured to march in order\nof battle five leagues in five hours, and sometimes, upon any urgent\noccasion, six.\n\nTheir military discipline was much ruder than ours, and accordingly\nproduced much greater effects.  The younger Scipio, reforming his army in\nSpain, ordered his soldiers to eat standing, and nothing that was drest.\nThe jeer that was given a Lacedaemonian soldier is marvellously pat to\nthis purpose, who, in an expedition of war, was reproached for having\nbeen seen under the roof of a house: they were so inured to hardship\nthat, let the weather be what it would, it was a shame to be seen under\nany other cover than the roof of heaven.  We should not march our people\nvery far at that rate.\n\nAs to what remains, Marcellinus,  a man bred up in the Roman wars,\ncuriously observes the manner of the Parthians arming themselves, and the\nrather, for being so different from that of the Romans.  \u201cThey had,\u201d says\nhe, \u201carmour so woven as to have all the scales fall over one another like\nso many little feathers; which did nothing hinder the motion of the body,\nand yet were of such resistance, that our darts hitting upon them, would\nrebound\u201d (these were the coats of mail our forefathers were so constantly\nwont to use).  And in another place: \u201cthey had,\u201d says he, \u201cstrong and\nable horses, covered with thick tanned hides of leather, and were\nthemselves armed \u2018cap-a-pie\u2019 with great plates of iron, so artificially\nordered, that in all parts of the limbs, which required bending, they\nlent themselves to the motion.  One would have said, that they had been\nmen of iron; having armour for the head so neatly fitted, and so\nnaturally representing the form of a face, that they were nowhere\nvulnerable, save at two little round holes, that gave them a little\nlight, corresponding with their eyes, and certain small chinks about\ntheir nostrils, through which they, with great difficulty, breathed,\u201d\n\n              \u201cFlexilis inductis animatur lamina membris,\n               Horribilis visu; credas simulacra moveri\n               Ferrea, cognatoque viros spirare metallo.\n               Par vestitus equis: ferrata fronte minantur,\n               Ferratosque movent, securi vulneris, armos.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cPlates of steel are placed over the body, so flexible that,\n     dreadful to be seen, you would think these not living men, but\n     moving images.  The horses are similarly armed, and, secured from\n     wounds, move their iron shoulders.\u201d--Claud, In Ruf., ii. 358.]\n\n\u2018Tis a description drawing very near resembling the equipage of the\nmen-at-arms in France, with their barded horses.  Plutarch says, that\nDemetrius caused two complete suits of armour to be made for himself and\nfor Alcimus, a captain of the greatest note and authority about him, of\nsix score pounds weight each, whereas the ordinary suits weighed but half\nas much.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nOF BOOKS\n\nI make no doubt but that I often happen to speak of things that are much\nbetter and more truly handled by those who are masters of the trade.  You\nhave here purely an essay of my natural parts, and not of those acquired:\nand whoever shall catch me tripping in ignorance, will not in any sort\nget the better of me; for I should be very unwilling to become\nresponsible to another for my writings, who am not so to myself, nor\nsatisfied with them.  Whoever goes in quest of knowledge, let him fish\nfor it where it is to be found; there is nothing I so little profess.\nThese are fancies of my own, by which I do not pretend to discover things\nbut to lay open myself; they may, peradventure, one day be known to me,\nor have formerly been, according as fortune has been able to bring me in\nplace where they have been explained; but I have utterly forgotten it;\nand if I am a man of some reading, I am a man of no retention; so that I\ncan promise no certainty, more than to make known to what point the\nknowledge I now have has risen.  Therefore, let none lay stress upon the\nmatter I write, but upon my method in writing it.  Let them observe, in\nwhat I borrow, if I have known how to choose what is proper to raise or\nhelp the invention, which is always my own.  For I make others say for\nme, not before but after me, what, either for want of language or want of\nsense, I cannot myself so well express.  I do not number my borrowings,\nI weigh them; and had I designed to raise their value by number, I had\nmade them twice as many; they are all, or within a very few, so famed and\nancient authors, that they seem, methinks, themselves sufficiently to\ntell who they are, without giving me the trouble.  In reasons,\ncomparisons, and arguments, if I transplant any into my own soil, and\nconfound them amongst my own, I purposely conceal the author, to awe the\ntemerity of those precipitate censors who fall upon all sorts of\nwritings, particularly the late ones, of men yet living; and in the\nvulgar tongue which puts every one into a capacity of criticising and\nwhich seem to convict the conception and design as vulgar also.  I will\nhave them give Plutarch a fillip on my nose, and rail against Seneca when\nthey think they rail at me.  I must shelter my own weakness under these\ngreat reputations.  I shall love any one that can unplume me, that is,\nby clearness of understanding and judgment, and by the sole distinction\nof the force and beauty of the discourse.  For I who, for want of memory,\nam at every turn at a loss to, pick them out of their national livery, am\nyet wise enough to know, by the measure of my own abilities, that my soil\nis incapable of producing any of those rich flowers that I there find\ngrowing; and that all the fruits of my own growth are not worth any one\nof them.  For this, indeed, I hold myself responsible; if I get in my own\nway; if there be any vanity and defect in my writings which I do not of\nmyself perceive nor can discern, when pointed out to me by another; for\nmany faults escape our eye, but the infirmity of judgment consists in not\nbeing able to discern them, when by another laid open to us.  Knowledge\nand truth may be in us without judgment, and judgment also without them;\nbut the confession of ignorance is one of the finest and surest\ntestimonies of judgment that I know.  I have no other officer to put my\nwritings in rank and file, but only fortune.  As things come into my\nhead, I heap them one upon another; sometimes they advance in whole\nbodies, sometimes in single file.  I would that every one should see my\nnatural and ordinary pace, irregular as it is; I suffer myself to jog on\nat my own rate.  Neither are these subjects which a man is not permitted\nto be ignorant in, or casually and at a venture, to discourse of.  I\ncould wish to have a more perfect knowledge of things, but I will not buy\nit so dear as it costs.  My design is to pass over easily, and not\nlaboriously, the remainder of my life; there is nothing that I will\ncudgel my brains about; no, not even knowledge, of what value soever.\n\nI seek, in the reading of books, only to please myself by an honest\ndiversion; or, if I study, \u2018tis for no other science than what treats of\nthe knowledge of myself, and instructs me how to die and how to live\nwell.\n\n               \u201cHas meus ad metas sudet oportet equus.\u201d\n\n               [\u201cMy horse must work according to my step.\u201d\n                --Propertius, iv.]\n\nI do not bite my nails about the difficulties I meet with in my reading;\nafter a charge or two, I give them over.  Should I insist upon them, I\nshould both lose myself and time; for I have an impatient understanding,\nthat must be satisfied at first: what I do not discern at once is by\npersistence rendered more obscure. I do nothing without gaiety;\ncontinuation and a too obstinate endeavour, darkens, stupefies, and tires\nmy judgment.  My sight is confounded and dissipated with poring; I must\nwithdraw it, and refer my discovery to new attempts; just as, to judge\nrightly of the lustre of scarlet, we are taught to pass the eye lightly\nover it, and again to run it over at several sudden and reiterated\nglances.  If one book do not please me, I take another; and I never\nmeddle with any, but at such times as I am weary of doing nothing.\nI care not much for new ones, because the old seem fuller and stronger;\nneither do I converse much with Greek authors, because my judgment cannot\ndo its work with imperfect intelligence of the material.\n\nAmongst books that are simply pleasant, of the moderns, Boccaccio\u2019s\nDecameron, Rabelais, and the Basia of Johannes Secundus (if those may be\nranged under the title) are worth reading for amusement.  As to the\nAmadis, and such kind of stuff, they had not the credit of arresting even\nmy childhood.  And I will, moreover, say, whether boldly or rashly, that\nthis old, heavy soul of mine is now no longer tickled with Ariosto, no,\nnor with the worthy Ovid; his facility and inventions, with which I was\nformerly so ravished, are now of no more relish, and I can hardly have\nthe patience to read them.  I speak my opinion freely of all things, even\nof those that, perhaps, exceed my capacity, and that I do not conceive to\nbe, in any wise, under my jurisdiction.  And, accordingly, the judgment I\ndeliver, is to show the measure of my own sight, and not of the things I\nmake so bold to criticise.  When I find myself disgusted with Plato\u2019s\n\u2018Axiochus\u2019, as with a work, with due respect to such an author be it\nspoken, without force, my judgment does not believe itself: it is not so\narrogant as to oppose the authority of so many other famous judgments of\nantiquity, which it considers as its tutors and masters, and with whom it\nis rather content to err; in such a case, it condemns itself either to\nstop at the outward bark, not being able to penetrate to the heart, or to\nconsider it by sortie false light.  It is content with only securing\nitself from trouble and disorder; as to its own weakness, it frankly\nacknowledges and confesses it.  It thinks it gives a just interpretation\nto the appearances by its conceptions presented to it; but they are weak\nand imperfect.  Most of the fables of AEsop have diverse senses and\nmeanings, of which the mythologists chose some one that quadrates well to\nthe fable; but, for the most part, \u2018tis but the first face that presents\nitself and is superficial only; there yet remain others more vivid,\nessential, and profound, into which they have not been able to penetrate;\nand just so \u2018tis with me.\n\nBut, to pursue the business of this essay, I have always thought that, in\npoesy, Virgil, Lucretius, Catullus, and Horace by many degrees excel the\nrest; and signally, Virgil in his Georgics, which I look upon as the most\naccomplished piece in poetry; and in comparison of which a man may easily\ndiscern that there are some places in his AEneids, to which the author\nwould have given a little more of the file, had he had leisure: and the\nfifth book of his AEneids seems to me the most perfect.  I also love\nLucan, and willingly read him, not so much for his style, as for his own\nworth, and the truth and solidity of his opinions and judgments.  As for\ngood Terence, the refined elegance and grace of the Latin tongue, I find\nhim admirable in his vivid representation of our manners and the\nmovements of the soul; our actions throw me at every turn upon him; and\nI cannot read him so often that I do not still discover some new grace\nand beauty.  Such as lived near Virgil\u2019s time complained that some should\ncompare Lucretius to him.  I am of opinion that the comparison is, in\ntruth, very unequal: a belief that, nevertheless, I have much ado to\nassure myself in, when I come upon some excellent passage in Lucretius.\nBut if they were so angry at this comparison, what would they say to the\nbrutish and barbarous stupidity of those who, nowadays, compare him with\nAriosto?  Would not Ariosto himself say?\n\n               \u201cO seclum insipiens et inficetum!\u201d\n\n          [\u201cO stupid and tasteless age.\u201d--Catullus, xliii. 8.]\n\nI think the ancients had more reason to be angry with those who compared\nPlautus with Terence, though much nearer the mark, than Lucretius with\nVirgil.  It makes much for the estimation and preference of Terence, that\nthe father of Roman eloquence has him so often, and alone of his class,\nin his mouth; and the opinion that the best judge of Roman poets\n--[Horace, De Art.  Poetica, 279.]--has passed upon his companion.  I\nhave often observed that those of our times, who take upon them to write\ncomedies (in imitation of the Italians, who are happy enough in that way\nof writing), take three or four plots of those of Plautus or Terence to\nmake one of their own, and , crowd five or six of Boccaccio\u2019s novels into\none single comedy.  That which makes them so load themselves with matter\nis the diffidence they have of being able to support themselves with\ntheir own strength.  They must find out something to lean to; and not\nhaving of their own stuff wherewith to entertain us, they bring in the\nstory to supply the defect of language.  It is quite otherwise with my\nauthor; the elegance and perfection of his way of speaking makes us lose\nthe appetite of his plot; his refined grace and elegance of diction\neverywhere occupy us: he is so pleasant throughout,\n\n               \u201cLiquidus, puroque simillimus amni,\u201d\n\n               [\u201cLiquid, and likest the pure river.\u201d\n                --Horace, Ep., ii. s, 120.]\n\nand so possesses the soul with his graces that we forget those of his\nfable.  This same consideration carries me further:  I observe that the\nbest of the ancient poets have avoided affectation and the hunting after,\nnot only fantastic Spanish and Petrarchic elevations, but even the softer\nand more gentle touches, which are the ornament of all succeeding poesy.\nAnd yet there is no good judgment that will condemn this in the ancients,\nand that does not incomparably more admire the equal polish, and that\nperpetual sweetness and flourishing beauty of Catullus\u2019s epigrams, than\nall the stings with which Martial arms the tails of his.  This is by the\nsame reason that I gave before, and as Martial says of himself:\n\n               \u201cMinus illi ingenio laborandum fuit,\n               in cujus locum materia successerat:\u201d\n\n     [\u201cHe had the less for his wit to do that the subject itself\n     supplied what was necessary.\u201d--Martial, praef.  ad lib. viii.]\n\nThe first, without being moved, or without getting angry, make themselves\nsufficiently felt; they have matter enough of laughter throughout, they\nneed not tickle themselves; the others have need of foreign assistance;\nas they have the less wit they must have the more body; they mount on\nhorseback, because they are not able to stand on their own legs.  As in\nour balls, those mean fellows who teach to dance, not being able to\nrepresent the presence and dignity of our noblesse, are fain to put\nthemselves forward with dangerous jumping, and other strange motions and\ntumblers tricks; and the ladies are less put to it in dance; where there\nare various coupees, changes, and quick motions of body, than in some\nother of a more sedate kind, where they are only to move a natural pace,\nand to represent their ordinary grace and presence.  And so I have seen\ngood drolls, when in their own everyday clothes, and with the same face\nthey always wear, give us all the pleasure of their art, when their\napprentices, not yet arrived at such a pitch of perfection, are fain to\nmeal their faces, put themselves into ridiculous disguises, and make a\nhundred grotesque faces to give us whereat to laugh.  This conception of\nmine is nowhere more demonstrable than in comparing the AEneid with\nOrlando Furioso; of which we see the first, by dint of wing, flying in a\nbrave and lofty place, and always following his point: the latter,\nfluttering and hopping from tale to tale, as from branch to branch, not\ndaring to trust his wings but in very short flights, and perching at\nevery turn, lest his breath and strength should fail.\n\n                    \u201cExcursusque breves tentat.\u201d\n\n               [\u201cAnd he attempts short excursions.\u201d\n                --Virgil, Georgics, iv.  194.]\n\nThese, then, as to this sort of subjects, are the authors that best\nplease me.\n\nAs to what concerns my other reading, that mixes a little more profit\nwith the pleasure, and whence I learn how to marshal my opinions and\nconditions, the books that serve me to this purpose are Plutarch, since\nhe has been translated into French, and Seneca.  Both of these have this\nnotable convenience suited to my humour, that the knowledge I there seek\nis discoursed in loose pieces, that do not require from me any trouble of\nreading long, of which I am incapable.  Such are the minor works of the\nfirst and the epistles of the latter, which are the best and most\nprofiting of all their writings.  \u2018Tis no great attempt to take one of\nthem in hand, and I give over at pleasure; for they have no sequence or\ndependence upon one another.  These authors, for the most part, concur in\nuseful and true opinions; and there is this parallel betwixt them, that\nfortune brought them into the world about the same century: they were\nboth tutors to two Roman emperors: both sought out from foreign\ncountries: both rich and both great men.  Their instruction is the cream\nof philosophy, and delivered after a plain and pertinent manner.\nPlutarch is more uniform and constant; Seneca more various and waving:\nthe last toiled and bent his whole strength to fortify virtue against\nweakness, fear, and vicious appetites; the other seems more to slight\ntheir power, and to disdain to alter his pace and to stand upon his\nguard.  Plutarch\u2019s opinions are Platonic, gentle, and accommodated to\ncivil society; those of the other are Stoical and Epicurean, more remote\nfrom the common use, but, in my opinion, more individually commodious and\nmore firm.  Seneca seems to lean a little to the tyranny of the emperors\nof his time, and only seems; for I take it for certain that he speaks\nagainst his judgment when he condemns the action of the generous\nmurderers of Caesar.  Plutarch is frank throughout: Seneca abounds with\nbrisk touches and sallies; Plutarch with things that warm and move you\nmore; this contents and pays you better: he guides us, the other pushes\nus on.\n\nAs to Cicero, his works that are most useful to my design are they that\ntreat of manners and rules of our life.  But boldly to confess the truth\n(for since one has passed the barriers of impudence, there is no bridle),\nhis way of writing appears to me negligent and uninviting: for his\nprefaces, definitions, divisions, and etymologies take up the greatest\npart of his work: whatever there is of life and marrow is smothered and\nlost in the long preparation.  When I have spent an hour in reading him,\nwhich is a great deal for me, and try to recollect what I have thence\nextracted of juice and substance, for the most part I find nothing but\nwind; for he is not yet come to the arguments that serve to his purpose,\nand to the reasons that properly help to form the knot I seek.  For me,\nwho only desire to become more wise, not more learned or eloquent, these\nlogical and Aristotelian dispositions of parts are of no use.  I would\nhave a man begin with the main proposition.  I know well enough what\ndeath and pleasure are; let no man give himself the trouble to anatomise\nthem to me.  I look for good and solid reasons, at the first dash, to\ninstruct me how to stand their shock, for which purpose neither\ngrammatical subtleties nor the quaint contexture of words and\nargumentations are of any use at all.  I am for discourses that give the\nfirst charge into the heart of the redoubt; his languish about the\nsubject; they are proper for the schools, for the bar, and for the\npulpit, where we have leisure to nod, and may awake, a quarter of an hour\nafter, time enough to find again the thread of the discourse.  It is\nnecessary to speak after this manner to judges, whom a man has a design\nto gain over, right or wrong, to children and common people, to whom a\nman must say all, and see what will come of it.  I would not have an\nauthor make it his business to render me attentive: or that he should cry\nout fifty times Oyez!  as the heralds do.  The Romans, in their religious\nexercises, began with \u2018Hoc age\u2019 as we in ours do with \u2018Sursum corda\u2019;\nthese are so many words lost to me: I come already fully prepared from my\nchamber.  I need no allurement, no invitation, no sauce; I eat the meat\nraw, so that, instead of whetting my appetite by these preparatives, they\ntire and pall it.  Will the licence of the time excuse my sacrilegious\nboldness if I censure the dialogism of Plato himself as also dull and\nheavy, too much stifling the matter, and lament so much time lost by a\nman, who had so many better things to say, in so many long and needless\npreliminary interlocutions?  My ignorance will better excuse me in that\nI understand not Greek so well as to discern the beauty of his language.\nI generally choose books that use sciences, not such as only lead to\nthem.  The two first, and Pliny, and their like, have nothing of this Hoc\nage; they will have to do with men already instructed; or if they have,\n\u2018tis a substantial Hoc age; and that has a body by itself.  I also\ndelight in reading the Epistles to Atticus, not only because they contain\na great deal of the history and affairs of his time, but much more\nbecause I therein discover much of his own private humours; for I have a\nsingular curiosity, as I have said elsewhere, to pry into the souls and\nthe natural and true opinions of the authors, with whom I converse.  A\nman may indeed judge of their parts, but not of their manners nor of\nthemselves, by the writings they exhibit upon the theatre of the world.\nI have a thousand times lamented the loss of the treatise Brutus wrote\nupon Virtue, for it is well to learn the theory from those who best know\nthe practice.\n\nBut seeing the matter preached and the preacher are different things,\nI would as willingly see Brutus in Plutarch, as in a book of his own.\nI would rather choose to be certainly informed of the conference he had\nin his tent with some particular friends of his the night before a\nbattle, than of the harangue he made the next day to his army; and of\nwhat he did in his closet and his chamber, than what he did in the public\nsquare and in the senate.  As to Cicero, I am of the common opinion that,\nlearning excepted, he had no great natural excellence.  He was a good\ncitizen, of an affable nature, as all fat, heavy men, such as he was,\nusually are; but given to ease, and had, in truth, a mighty share of\nvanity and ambition.  Neither do I know how to excuse him for thinking\nhis poetry fit to be published; \u2018tis no great imperfection to make ill\nverses, but it is an imperfection not to be able to judge how unworthy\nhis verses were of the glory of his name.  For what concerns his\neloquence, that is totally out of all comparison, and I believe it will\nnever be equalled.  The younger Cicero, who resembled his father in\nnothing but in name, whilst commanding in Asia, had several strangers one\nday at his table, and, amongst the rest, Cestius seated at the lower end,\nas men often intrude to the open tables of the great.  Cicero asked one\nof his people who that man was, who presently told him his name; but he,\nas one who had his thoughts taken up with something else, and who had\nforgotten the answer made him, asking three or four times, over and over\nagain; the same question, the fellow, to deliver himself from so many\nanswers and to make him know him by some particular circumstance; \u201c\u2018tis\nthat Cestius,\u201d said he, \u201cof whom it was told you, that he makes no great\naccount of your father\u2019s eloquence in comparison of his own.\u201d  At which\nCicero, being suddenly nettled, commanded poor Cestius presently to be\nseized, and caused him to be very well whipped in his own presence; a\nvery discourteous entertainer!  Yet even amongst those, who, all things\nconsidered, have reputed his, eloquence incomparable, there have been\nsome, who have not stuck to observe some faults in it: as that great\nBrutus his friend, for example, who said \u2018twas a broken and feeble\neloquence, \u2018fyactam et elumbem\u2019.  The orators also, nearest to the age\nwherein he lived, reprehended in him the care he had of a certain long\ncadence in his periods, and particularly took notice of these words,\n\u2018esse videatur\u2019, which he there so often makes use of.  For my part, I\nmore approve of a shorter style, and that comes more roundly off.  He\ndoes, though, sometimes shuffle his parts more briskly together, but \u2018tis\nvery seldom.  I have myself taken notice of this one passage:\n\n              \u201cEgo vero me minus diu senem mallem,\n               quam esse senem, antequam essem.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cI had rather be old a brief time, than be old before old age.\n     --\u201cCicero, De Senect., c. 10.]\n\nThe historians are my right ball, for they are pleasant and easy, and\nwhere man, in general, the knowledge of whom I hunt after, appears more\nvividly and entire than anywhere else:\n\n     [The easiest of my amusements, the right ball at tennis being that\n     which coming to the player from the right hand, is much easier\n     played with.--Coste.]\n\nthe variety and truth of his internal qualities, in gross and piecemeal,\nthe diversity of means by which he is united and knit, and the accidents\nthat threaten him.  Now those that write lives, by reason they insist\nmore upon counsels than events, more upon what sallies from within, than\nupon what happens without, are the most proper for my reading; and,\ntherefore, above all others, Plutarch is the man for me.  I am very sorry\nwe have not a dozen Laertii,--[Diogenes Laertius, who wrote the Lives of\nthe Philosophers]--or that he was not further extended; for I am equally\ncurious to know the lives and fortunes of these great instructors of the\nworld, as to know the diversities of their doctrines and opinions.  In\nthis kind of study of histories, a man must tumble over, without\ndistinction, all sorts of authors, old and new, French or foreign, there\nto know the things of which they variously treat.  But Caesar, in my\nopinion, particularly deserves to be studied, not for the knowledge of\nthe history only, but for himself, so great an excellence and perfection\nhe has above all the rest, though Sallust be one of the number.  In\nearnest, I read this author with more reverence and respect than is\nusually allowed to human writings; one while considering him in his\nperson, by his actions and miraculous greatness, and another in the\npurity and inimitable polish of his language, wherein he not only excels\nall other historians, as Cicero confesses,  but, peradventure, even\nCicero himself; speaking of his enemies with so much sincerity in his\njudgment, that, the false colours with which he strives to palliate his\nevil cause, and the ordure of his pestilent ambition excepted, I think\nthere is no fault to be objected against him, saving this, that he speaks\ntoo sparingly of himself, seeing so many great things could not have been\nperformed under his conduct, but that his own personal acts must\nnecessarily have had a greater share in them than he attributes to them.\n\nI love historians, whether of the simple sort, or of the higher order.\nThe simple, who have nothing of their own to mix with it, and who only\nmake it their business to collect all that comes to their knowledge, and\nfaithfully to record all things, without choice or discrimination, leave\nto us the entire judgment of discerning the truth.  Such, for example,\namongst others, is honest Froissart, who has proceeded in his undertaking\nwith so frank a plainness that, having committed an error, he is not\nashamed to confess and correct it in the place where the finger has been\nlaid, and who represents to us even the variety of rumours that were then\nspread abroad, and the different reports that were made to him; \u2018tis the\nnaked and inform matter of history, and of which every one may make his\nprofit, according to his understanding.  The more excellent sort of\nhistorians have judgment to pick out what is most worthy to be known;\nand, of two reports, to examine which is the most likely to be true: from\nthe condition of princes and their humours, they conclude their counsels,\nand attribute to them words proper for the occasion; such have title to\nassume the authority of regulating our belief to what they themselves\nbelieve; but certainly, this privilege belongs to very few.  For the\nmiddle sort of historians, of which the most part are, they spoil all;\nthey will chew our meat for us; they take upon them to judge of, and\nconsequently, to incline the history to their own fancy; for if the\njudgment lean to one side, a man cannot avoid wresting and writhing his\nnarrative to that bias; they undertake to select things worthy to be\nknown, and yet often conceal from us such a word, such a private action,\nas would much better instruct us; omit, as incredible, such things as\nthey do not understand, and peradventure some, because they cannot\nexpress good French or Latin.  Let them display their eloquence and\nintelligence, and judge according to their own fancy: but let them,\nwithal, leave us something to judge of after them, and neither alter nor\ndisguise, by their abridgments and at their own choice, anything of the\nsubstance of the matter, but deliver it to us pure and entire in all its\ndimensions.\n\nFor the most part, and especially in these latter ages, persons are\nculled out for this work from amongst the common people, upon the sole\nconsideration of well-speaking, as if we were to learn grammar from them;\nand the men so chosen have fair reason, being hired for no other end and\npretending to nothing but babble, not to be very solicitous of any part\nbut that, and so, with a fine jingle of words, prepare us a pretty\ncontexture of reports they pick up in the streets.  The only good\nhistories are those that have been written themselves who held command in\nthe affairs whereof they write, or who participated in the conduct of\nthem, or, at least, who have had the conduct of others of the same\nnature.  Such are almost all the Greek and Roman histories: for, several\neye-witnesses having written of the same subject, in the time when\ngrandeur and learning commonly met in the same person, if there happen to\nbe an error, it must of necessity be a very slight one, and upon a very\ndoubtful incident.  What can a man expect from a physician who writes of\nwar, or from a mere scholar, treating of the designs of princes?  If we\ncould take notice how scrupulous the Romans were in this, there would\nneed but this example: Asinius Pollio found in the histories of Caesar\nhimself something misreported, a mistake occasioned; either by reason he\ncould not have his eye in all parts of his army at once and had given\ncredit to some individual persons who had not delivered him a very true\naccount; or else, for not having had too perfect notice given him by his\nlieutenants of what they had done in his absence.--[Suetonius, Life of\nCaesar, c. 56.]--By which we may see, whether the inquisition after\ntruth be not very delicate, when a man cannot believe the report of a\nbattle from the knowledge of him who there commanded, nor from the\nsoldiers who were engaged in it, unless, after the method of a judicial\ninquiry, the witnesses be confronted and objections considered upon the\nproof of the least detail of every incident.  In good earnest the\nknowledge we have of our own affairs, is much more obscure: but that has\nbeen sufficiently handled by Bodin, and according to my own sentiment\n--[In the work by jean Bodin, entitled \u201cMethodus ad facilem historiarum\ncognitionem.\u201d  1566.]--A little to aid the weakness of my memory (so\nextreme that it has happened to me more than once, to take books again\ninto my hand as new and unseen, that I had carefully read over a few\nyears before, and scribbled with my notes) I have adopted a custom of\nlate, to note at the end of every book (that is, of those I never intend\nto read again) the time when I made an end on\u2019t, and the judgment I had\nmade of it, to the end that this might, at least, represent to me the\ncharacter and general idea I had conceived of the author in reading it;\nand I will here transcribe some of those annotations.\n\nI wrote this, some ten years ago, in my Guicciardini (of what language\nsoever my books speak to me in, I always speak to them in my own): \u201cHe is\na diligent historiographer, from whom, in my opinion, a man may learn the\ntruth of the affairs of his time, as exactly as from any other; in the\nmost of which he was himself also a personal actor, and in honourable\ncommand.  There is no appearance that he disguised anything, either upon\nthe account of hatred, favour, or vanity; of which the free censures he\npasses upon the great ones, and particularly those by whom he was\nadvanced and employed in commands of great trust and honour, as Pope\nClement VII., give ample testimony.  As to that part which he thinks\nhimself the best at, namely, his digressions and discourses, he has\nindeed some very good, and enriched with fine features; but he is too\nfond of them: for, to leave nothing unsaid, having a subject so full,\nample, almost infinite, he degenerates into pedantry and smacks a little\nof scholastic prattle.  I have also observed this in him, that of so many\nsouls and so many effects, so many motives and so many counsels as he\njudges, he never attributes any one to virtue, religion, or conscience,\nas if all these were utterly extinct in the world: and of all the\nactions, how brave soever in outward show they appear in themselves, he\nalways refers the cause and motive to some vicious occasion or some\nprospect of profit.  It is impossible to imagine but that, amongst such\nan infinite number of actions as he makes mention of, there must be some\none produced by the way of honest reason.  No corruption could so\nuniversally have infected men that some one would not escape the\ncontagion which makes me suspect that his own taste was vicious, whence\nit might happen that he judged other men by himself.\u201d\n\nIn my Philip de Commines there is this written: \u201cYou will here find the\nlanguage sweet and delightful, of a natural simplicity, the narration\npure, with the good faith of the author conspicuous therein; free from\nvanity, when speaking of himself, and from affection or envy, when\nspeaking of others: his discourses and exhortations rather accompanied\nwith zeal and truth, than with any exquisite sufficiency; and,\nthroughout, authority and gravity, which bespeak him a man of good\nextraction, and brought up in great affairs.\u201d\n\nUpon the Memoirs of Monsieur du Bellay I find this: \u201c\u2018Tis always pleasant\nto read things written by those that have experienced how they ought to\nbe carried on; but withal, it cannot be denied but there is a manifest\ndecadence in these two lords--[Martin du Bellay and Guillaume de Langey,\nbrothers, who jointly wrote the Memoirs.]--from the freedom and liberty\nof writing that shine in the elder historians, such as the Sire de\nJoinville, the familiar companion of St. Louis; Eginhard, chancellor to\nCharlemagne; and of later date, Philip de Commines.  What we have here is\nrather an apology for King Francis, against the Emperor Charles V., than\nhistory.  I will not believe that they have falsified anything, as to\nmatter of fact; but they make a common practice of twisting the judgment\nof events, very often contrary to reason, to our advantage, and of\nomitting whatsoever is ticklish to be handled in the life of their\nmaster; witness the proceedings of Messieurs de Montmorency and de Biron,\nwhich are here omitted: nay, so much as the very name of Madame\nd\u2019Estampes is not here to be found.  Secret actions an historian may\nconceal; but to pass over in silence what all the world knows and things\nthat have drawn after them public and such high consequences, is an\ninexcusable defect.  In fine, whoever has a mind to have a perfect\nknowledge of King Francis and the events of his reign, let him seek it\nelsewhere, if my advice may prevail.  The only profit a man can reap from\nthese Memoirs is in the special narrative of battles and other exploits\nof war wherein these gentlemen were personally engaged; in some words and\nprivate actions of the princes of their time, and in the treaties and\nnegotiations carried on by the Seigneur de Langey, where there are\neverywhere things worthy to be known, and discourses above the vulgar\nstrain.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nOF CRUELTY\n\nI fancy virtue to be something else, and something more noble, than good\nnature, and the mere propension to goodness, that we are born into the\nworld withal.  Well-disposed and well-descended souls pursue, indeed, the\nsame methods, and represent in their actions the same face that virtue\nitself does: but the word virtue imports, I know not what, more great and\nactive than merely for a man to suffer himself, by a happy disposition,\nto be gently and quietly drawn to the rule of reason.  He who, by a\nnatural sweetness and facility, should despise injuries received, would\ndoubtless do a very fine and laudable thing; but he who, provoked and\nnettled to the quick by an offence, should fortify himself with the arms\nof reason against the furious appetite of revenge, and after a great\nconflict, master his own passion, would certainly do a great deal more.\nThe first would do well; the latter virtuously: one action might be\ncalled goodness, and the other virtue; for methinks, the very name of\nvirtue presupposes difficulty and contention, and cannot be exercised\nwithout an opponent.  \u2018Tis for this reason, perhaps, that we call God\ngood, mighty, liberal and just; but we do not call Him virtuous, being\nthat all His operations are natural and without endeavour.--[Rousseau,\nin his Emile, book v., adopts this passage almost in the same words.]--\nIt has been the opinion of many philosophers, not only Stoics, but\nEpicureans--and this addition--\n\n     [\u201cMontaigne stops here to make his excuse for thus naming the\n     Epicureans with the Stoics, in conformity to the general opinion\n     that the Epicureans were not so rigid in their morals as the Stoics,\n     which is not true in the main, as he demonstrates at one view.  This\n     involved Montaigne in a tedious parenthesis, during which it is\n     proper that the reader be attentive, that he may not entirely lose\n     the thread of the argument.  In some later editions of this author,\n     it has been attempted to remedy this inconvenience, but without\n     observing that Montaigne\u2019s argument is rendered more feeble and\n     obscure by such vain repetitions: it is a licence that ought not to\n     be taken, because he who publishes the work of another, ought to\n     give it as the other composed ft.  But, in Mr Cotton\u2019s translation,\n     he was so puzzled with this enormous parenthesis that he has quite\n     left it out\u201d--Coste.]\n\nI borrow from the vulgar opinion, which is false, notwithstanding the\nwitty conceit of Arcesilaus in answer to one, who, being reproached that\nmany scholars went from his school to the Epicurean, but never any from\nthence to his school, said in answer, \u201cI believe it indeed; numbers of\ncapons being made out of cocks, but never any cocks out of capons.\u201d\n --[Diogenes Laertius, Life of Archesilaus, lib.  iv., 43.]--For, in truth,\nthe Epicurean sect is not at all inferior to the Stoic in steadiness, and\nthe rigour of opinions and precepts.  And a certain Stoic, showing more\nhonesty than those disputants, who, in order to quarrel with Epicurus,\nand to throw the game into their hands, make him say what he never\nthought, putting a wrong construction upon his words, clothing his\nsentences, by the strict rules of grammar, with another meaning, and a\ndifferent opinion from that which they knew he entertained in his mind\nand in his morals, the Stoic, I say, declared that he abandoned the\nEpicurean sect, upon this among other considerations, that he thought\ntheir road too lofty and inaccessible;\n\n     [\u201cAnd those are called lovers of pleasure, being in effect\n     lovers of honour and justice, who cultivate and observe all\n     the virtues.\u201d--Cicero, Ep.  Fam., xv. i, 19.]\n\nThese philosophers say that it is not enough to have the soul seated in\na good place, of a good temper, and well disposed to virtue; it is not\nenough to have our resolutions and our reasoning fixed above all the\npower of fortune, but that we are, moreover, to seek occasions wherein to\nput them to the proof: they would seek pain, necessity, and contempt to\ncontend with them and to keep the soul in breath:\n\n               \u201cMultum sibi adjicit virtus lacessita.\u201d\n\n               [\u201cVirtue is much strengthened by combats.\u201d\n                or:  \u201cVirtue attacked adds to its own force.\u201d\n                --Seneca, Ep., 13.]\n\n\u2018Tis one of the reasons why Epaminondas, who was yet of a third sect,\n--[The Pythagorean.]--refused the riches fortune presented to him by\nvery lawful means; because, said he, I am to contend with poverty, in\nwhich extreme he maintained himself to the last.  Socrates put himself,\nmethinks, upon a ruder trial, keeping for his exercise a confounded\nscolding wife, which was fighting at sharps.  Metellus having, of all the\nRoman senators, alone attempted, by the power of virtue, to withstand the\nviolence of Saturninus, tribune of the people at Rome, who would, by all\nmeans, cause an unjust law to pass in favour of the commons, and, by so\ndoing, having incurred the capital penalties that Saturninus had\nestablished against the dissentient, entertained those who, in this\nextremity, led him to execution with words to this effect: That it was a\nthing too easy and too base to do ill; and that to do well where there\nwas no danger was a common thing; but that to do well where there was\ndanger was the proper office of a man of virtue.  These words of Metellus\nvery clearly represent to us what I would make out, viz., that virtue\nrefuses facility for a companion; and that the easy, smooth, and\ndescending way by which the regular steps of a sweet disposition of\nnature are conducted is not that of a true virtue; she requires a rough\nand stormy passage; she will have either exotic difficulties to wrestle\nwith, like that of Metellus, by means whereof fortune delights to\ninterrupt the speed of her career, or internal difficulties, that the\ninordinate appetites and imperfections of our condition introduce to\ndisturb her.\n\nI am come thus far at my ease; but here it comes into my head that the\nsoul of Socrates, the most perfect that ever came to my knowledge, should\nby this rule be of very little recommendation; for I cannot conceive in\nthat person any the least motion of a vicious inclination: I cannot\nimagine there could be any difficulty or constraint in the course of his\nvirtue: I know his reason to be so powerful and sovereign over him that\nshe would never have suffered a vicious appetite so much as to spring in\nhim.  To a virtue so elevated as his, I have nothing to oppose.  Methinks\nI see him march, with a victorious and triumphant pace, in pomp and at\nhis ease, without opposition or disturbance.  If virtue cannot shine\nbright, but by the conflict of contrary appetites, shall we then say that\nshe cannot subsist without the assistance of vice, and that it is from\nher that she derives her reputation and honour?  What then, also, would\nbecome of that brave and generous Epicurean pleasure, which makes account\nthat it nourishes virtue tenderly in her lap, and there makes it play and\nwanton, giving it for toys to play withal, shame, fevers, poverty, death,\nand torments?  If I presuppose that a perfect virtue manifests itself in\ncontending, in patient enduring of pain, and undergoing the uttermost\nextremity of the gout; without being moved in her seat; if I give her\ntroubles and difficulty for her necessary objects: what will become of a\nvirtue elevated to such a degree, as not only to despise pain, but,\nmoreover, to rejoice in it, and to be tickled with the throes of a sharp\ncolic, such as the Epicureans have established, and of which many of\nthem, by their actions, have given most manifest proofs?  As have several\nothers, who I find to have surpassed in effects even the very rules of\ntheir discipline.  Witness the younger Cato: When I see him die, and\ntearing out his own bowels, I am not satisfied simply to believe that he\nhad then his soul totally exempt from all trouble and horror: I cannot\nthink that he only maintained himself in the steadiness that the Stoical\nrules prescribed him; temperate, without emotion, and imperturbed.  There\nwas, methinks, something in the virtue of this man too sprightly and\nfresh to stop there; I believe that, without doubt, he felt a pleasure\nand delight in so noble an action, and was more pleased in it than in any\nother of his life:\n\n     \u201cSic abiit a vita, ut causam moriendi nactum se esse gauderet.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cHe quitted life rejoicing that a reason for dying had arisen.\u201d\n      --Cicero, Tusc. Quaes., i. 30.]\n\nI believe it so thoroughly that I question whether he would have been\ncontent to have been deprived of the occasion of so brave an exploit; and\nif the goodness that made him embrace the public concern more than his\nown, withheld me not, I should easily fall into an opinion that he\nthought himself obliged to fortune for having put his virtue upon so\nbrave a trial, and for having favoured that theif--[Caesar]--in treading\nunderfoot the ancient liberty of his country.  Methinks I read in this\naction I know not what exaltation in his soul, and an extraordinary and\nmanly emotion of pleasure, when he looked upon the generosity and height\nof his enterprise:\n\n                    \u201cDeliberate morte ferocior,\u201d\n\n          [\u201cThe more courageous from the deliberation to die.\u201d\n           --Horace, Od., i. 37, 29.]\n\nnot stimulated with any hope of glory, as the popular and effeminate\njudgments of some have concluded (for that consideration was too mean and\nlow to possess so generous, so haughty, and so determined a heart as\nhis), but for the very beauty of the thing in itself, which he who had\nthe handling of the springs discerned more clearly and in its perfection\nthan we are able to do.  Philosophy has obliged me in determining that so\nbrave an action had been indecently placed in any other life than that of\nCato; and that it only appertained to his to end so; notwithstanding, and\naccording to reason, he commanded his son and the senators who\naccompanied him to take another course in their affairs:\n\n          \u201cCatoni, quum incredibilem natura tribuisset gravitatem,\n          eamque ipse perpetue constantia roboravisset, semperque\n          in proposito consilio permansisset, moriendum potius,\n          quam tyranni vultus aspiciendus, erat.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cCato, whom nature had given incredible dignity, which he had\n     fortified by perpetual constancy, ever remaining of his\n     predetermined opinion, preferred to die rather than to look\n     on the countenance of a tyrant.\u201d--Cicero, De Ofc., i. 31.]\n\nEvery death ought to hold proportion with the life before it; we do not\nbecome others for dying.  I always interpret the death by the life\npreceding; and if any one tell me of a death strong and constant in\nappearance, annexed to a feeble life, I conclude it produced by some\nfeeble cause, and suitable to the life before.  The easiness then of his\ndeath and the facility of dying he had acquired by the vigour of his\nsoul; shall we say that it ought to abate anything of the lustre of his\nvirtue?  And who, that has his brain never so little tinctured with the\ntrue philosophy, can be content to imagine Socrates only free from fear\nand passion in the accident of his prison, fetters, and condemnation?\nand that will not discover in him not only firmness and constancy (which\nwas his ordinary condition), but, moreover, I know not what new\nsatisfaction, and a frolic cheerfulness in his last words and actions?\nIn the start he gave with the pleasure of scratching his leg when his\nirons were taken off, does he not discover an equal serenity and joy in\nhis soul for being freed from past inconveniences, and at the same time\nto enter into the knowledge of the things to come?  Cato shall pardon me,\nif he please; his death indeed is more tragical and more lingering; but\nyet this is, I know not how, methinks, finer.  Aristippus, to one that\nwas lamenting this death: \u201cThe gods grant me such an one,\u201d said he.\nA man discerns in the soul of these two great men and their imitators\n(for I very much doubt whether there were ever their equals) so perfect a\nhabitude to virtue, that it was turned to a complexion.  It is no longer\na laborious virtue, nor the precepts of reason, to maintain which the\nsoul is so racked, but the very essence of their soul, its natural and\nordinary habit; they have rendered it such by a long practice of\nphilosophical precepts having lit upon a rich and fine nature; the\nvicious passions that spring in us can find no entrance into them; the\nforce and vigour of their soul stifle and extinguish irregular desires,\nso soon as they begin to move.\n\nNow, that it is not more noble, by a high and divine resolution, to\nhinder the birth of temptations, and to be so formed to virtue, that the\nvery seeds of vice are rooted out, than to hinder by main force their\nprogress; and, having suffered ourselves to be surprised with the first\nmotions of the passions, to arm ourselves and to stand firm to oppose\ntheir progress, and overcome them; and that this second effect is not\nalso much more generous than to be simply endowed with a facile and\naffable nature, of itself disaffected to debauchery and vice, I do not\nthink can be doubted; for this third and last sort of virtue seems to\nrender a man innocent, but not virtuous; free from doing ill, but not apt\nenough to do well: considering also, that this condition is so near\nneighbour to imperfection and cowardice, that I know not very well how to\nseparate the confines and distinguish them: the very names of goodness\nand innocence are, for this reason, in some sort grown into contempt.\nI very well know that several virtues, as chastity, sobriety, and\ntemperance, may come to a man through personal defects.  Constancy in\ndanger, if it must be so called, the contempt of death, and patience in\nmisfortunes, may ofttimes be found in men for want of well judging of\nsuch accidents, and not apprehending them for such as they are.  Want of\napprehension and stupidity sometimes counterfeit virtuous effects as I\nhave often seen it happen, that men have been commended for what really\nmerited blame.  An Italian lord once said this, in my presence, to the\ndisadvantage of his own nation: that the subtlety of the Italians, and\nthe vivacity of their conceptions were so great, and they foresaw the\ndangers and accidents that might befall them so far off, that it was not\nto be thought strange, if they were often, in war, observed to provide\nfor their safety, even before they had discovered the peril; that we\nFrench and the Spaniards, who were not so cunning, went on further, and\nthat we must be made to see and feel the danger before we would take the\nalarm; but that even then we could not stick to it.  But the Germans and\nSwiss, more gross and heavy, had not the sense to look about them, even\nwhen the blows were falling about their ears.  Peradventure, he only\ntalked so for mirth\u2019s sake; and yet it is most certain that in war raw\nsoldiers rush into dangers with more precipitancy than after they have\nbeen cudgelled*--(The original has eschauldex--scalded)\n\n         \u201cHaud ignarus .  .  .  .  quantum nova gloria in armis,\n          Et praedulce decus, primo certamine possit.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cNot ignorant how much power the fresh glory of arms and sweetest\n     honour possess in the first contest.\u201d--AEneid, xi. 154]\n\nFor this reason it is that, when we judge of a particular action, we are\nto consider the circumstances, and the whole man by whom it is performed,\nbefore we give it a name.\n\nTo instance in myself: I have sometimes known my friends call that\nprudence in me, which was merely fortune; and repute that courage and\npatience, which was judgment and opinion; and attribute to me one title\nfor another, sometimes to my advantage and sometimes otherwise.  As to\nthe rest, I am so far from being arrived at the first and most perfect\ndegree of excellence, where virtue is turned into habit, that even of the\nsecond I have made no great proofs.  I have not been very solicitous to\ncurb the desires by which I have been importuned.  My virtue is a virtue,\nor rather an innocence, casual and accidental.  If I had been born of a\nmore irregular complexion, I am afraid I should have made scurvy work;\nfor I never observed any great stability in my soul to resist passions,\nif they were never so little vehement: I know not how to nourish quarrels\nand debates in my own bosom, and, consequently, owe myself no great\nthanks that I am free from several vices:\n\n              \u201cSi vitiis mediocribus et mea paucis\n               Mendosa est natura, alioqui recta, velut si\n               Egregio inspersos reprehendas corpore naevos:\u201d\n\n     [\u201cIf my nature be disfigured only with slight and few vices, and is\n     otherwise just, it is as if you should blame moles on a fair body.\u201d\n      --Horatius, Sat., i. 6, 65.]\n\nI owe it rather to my fortune than my reason.  She has caused me to be\ndescended of a race famous for integrity and of a very good father; I\nknow not whether or no he has infused into me part of his humours, or\nwhether domestic examples and the good education of my infancy have\ninsensibly assisted in the work, or, if I was otherwise born so:\n\n                    \u201cSeu Libra, seu me Scorpius adspicit\n                    Formidolosus, pars violentior\n                    Natalis hors, seu tyrannus\n                    Hesperive Capricornus undae:\u201d\n\n     [\u201cWhether the Balance or dread Scorpio, more potent over my natal\n     hour, aspects me, or Capricorn, supreme over the Hesperian sea.\u201d\n      --Horace, Od., ii. 117.]\n\nbut so it is, that I have naturally a horror for most vices.  The answer\nof Antisthenes to him who asked him, which was the best apprenticeship\n\u201cto unlearn evil,\u201d seems to point at this.  I have them in horror, I say,\nwith a detestation so natural, and so much my own, that the same instinct\nand impression I brought of them with me from my nurse, I yet retain, and\nno temptation whatever has had the power to make me alter it.  Not so\nmuch as my own discourses, which in some things lashing out of the common\nroad might seem easily to license me to actions that my natural\ninclination makes me hate.  I will say a prodigious thing, but I will say\nit, however: I find myself in many things more under reputation by my\nmanners than by my opinion, and my concupiscence less debauched than my\nreason.  Aristippus instituted opinions so bold in favour of pleasure and\nriches as set all the philosophers against him: but as to his manners,\nDionysius the tyrant, having presented three beautiful women before him,\nto take his choice; he made answer, that he would choose them all, and\nthat Paris got himself into trouble for having preferred one before the\nother two: but, having taken them home to his house, he sent them back\nuntouched.  His servant finding himself overladen upon the way, with the\nmoney he carried after him, he ordered him to pour out and throw away\nthat which troubled him.  And Epicurus, whose doctrines were so\nirreligious and effeminate, was in his life very laborious and devout;\nhe wrote to a friend of his that he lived only upon biscuit and water,\nentreating him to send him a little cheese, to lie by him against he had\na mind to make a feast.  Must it be true, that to be a perfect good man,\nwe must be so by an occult, natural, and universal propriety, without\nlaw, reason, or example?  The debauches wherein I have been engaged, have\nnot been, I thank God, of the worst sort, and I have condemned them in\nmyself, for my judgment was never infected by them; on the contrary,\nI accuse them more severely in myself than in any other; but that is all,\nfor, as to the rest.  I oppose too little resistance and suffer myself to\nincline too much to the other side of the balance, excepting that I\nmoderate them, and prevent them from mixing with other vices, which for\nthe most part will cling together, if a man have not a care.  I have\ncontracted and curtailed mine, to make them as single and as simple as I\ncan:\n\n                              \u201cNec ultra\n                    Errorem foveo.\u201d\n\n               [\u201cNor do I cherish error further.\u201d\n                or: \u201cNor carry wrong further.\u201d\n                --Juvenal, viii. 164.]\n\nFor as to the opinion of the Stoics, who say, \u201cThat the wise man when he\nworks, works by all the virtues together, though one be most apparent,\naccording to the nature of the action\u201d; and herein the similitude of a\nhuman body might serve them somewhat, for the action of anger cannot\nwork, unless all the humours assist it, though choler predominate;\n--if they will thence draw a like consequence, that when the wicked man\ndoes wickedly, he does it by all the vices together, I do not believe it\nto be so, or else I understand them not, for I by effect find the\ncontrary.  These are sharp, unsubstantial subleties, with which\nphilosophy sometimes amuses itself.  I follow some vices, but I fly\nothers as much as a saint would do.  The Peripatetics also disown this\nindissoluble connection; and Aristotle is of opinion that a prudent and\njust man may be intemperate and inconsistent.  Socrates confessed to some\nwho had discovered a certain inclination to vice in his physiognomy, that\nit was, in truth, his natural propension, but that he had by discipline\ncorrected it.  And such as were familiar with the philosopher Stilpo\nsaid, that being born with addiction to wine and women, he had by study\nrendered himself very abstinent both from the one and the other.\n\nWhat I have in me of good, I have, quite contrary, by the chance of my\nbirth; and hold it not either by law, precept, or any other instruction;\nthe innocence that is in me is a simple one; little vigour and no art.\nAmongst other vices, I mortally hate cruelty, both by nature and\njudgment, as the very extreme of all vices: nay, with so much tenderness\nthat I cannot see a chicken\u2019s neck pulled off without trouble, and cannot\nwithout impatience endure the cry of a hare in my dog\u2019s teeth, though the\nchase be a violent pleasure.  Such as have sensuality to encounter,\nfreely make use of this argument, to shew that it is altogether \u201cvicious\nand unreasonable; that when it is at the height, it masters us to that\ndegree that a man\u2019s reason can have no access,\u201d and instance our own\nexperience in the act of love,\n\n                    \u201cQuum jam praesagit gaudia corpus,\n                    Atque in eo est Venus,\n                    ut muliebria conserat arva.\u201d\n\n     [None of the translators of the old editions used for this etext\n     have been willing to translate this passage from Lucretius, iv.\n     1099; they take a cop out by bashfully saying: \u201cThe sense is in the\n     preceding passage of the text.\u201d  D.W.]\n\nwherein they conceive that the pleasure so transports us, that our reason\ncannot perform its office, whilst we are in such ecstasy and rapture.  I\nknow very well it may be otherwise, and that a man may sometimes, if he\nwill, gain this point over himself to sway his soul, even in the critical\nmoment, to think of something else; but then he must ply it to that bent.\nI know that a man may triumph over the utmost effort of this pleasure: I\nhave experienced it in myself, and have not found Venus so imperious a\ngoddess, as many, and much more virtuous men than I, declare.  I do not\nconsider it a miracle, as the Queen of Navarre does in one of the Tales\nof her Heptameron--[\u201cVu gentil liure pour son estoffe.\u201d]--(which is a\nvery pretty book of its kind), nor for a thing of extreme difficulty, to\npass whole nights, where a man has all the convenience and liberty he can\ndesire, with a long-coveted mistress, and yet be true to the pledge first\ngiven to satisfy himself with kisses and suchlike endearments, without\npressing any further.  I conceive that the example of the pleasure of the\nchase would be more proper; wherein though the pleasure be less, there is\nthe higher excitement of unexpected joy, giving no time for the reason,\ntaken by surprise, to prepare itself for the encounter, when after a long\nquest the beast starts up on a sudden in a place where, peradventure, we\nleast expected it; the shock and the ardour of the shouts and cries of\nthe hunters so strike us, that it would be hard for those who love this\nlesser chase, to turn their thoughts upon the instant another way; and\nthe poets make Diana triumph over the torch and shafts of Cupid:\n\n              \u201cQuis non malarum, quas amor curas habet,\n               Haec inter obliviscitur?\u201d\n\n     [\u201cWho, amongst such delights would not remove out of his thoughts\n     the anxious cares of love.\u201d--Horace, Epod., ii. 37.]\n\nTo return to what I was saying before, I am tenderly compassionate of\nothers\u2019 afflictions, and should readily cry for company, if, upon any\noccasion whatever, I could cry at all.  Nothing tempts my tears but\ntears, and not only those that are real and true, but whatever they are,\nfeigned or painted.  I do not much lament the dead, and should envy them\nrather; but I very much lament the dying.  The savages do not so much\noffend me, in roasting and eating the bodies of the dead, as they do who\ntorment and persecute the living.  Nay, I cannot look so much as upon the\nordinary executions of justice, how reasonable soever, with a steady eye.\nSome one having to give testimony of Julius Caesar\u2019s clemency; \u201che was,\u201d\n says he, \u201cmild in his revenges.  Having compelled the pirates to yield by\nwhom he had before been taken prisoner and put to ransom; forasmuch as he\nhad threatened them with the cross, he indeed condemned them to it, but\nit was after they had been first strangled.  He punished his secretary\nPhilemon, who had attempted to poison him, with no greater severity than\nmere death.\u201d  Without naming that Latin author,--[Suetonius, Life of\nCasay, c. 74.]--who thus dares to allege as a testimony of mercy the\nkilling only of those by whom we have been offended; it is easy to guess\nthat he was struck with the horrid and inhuman examples of cruelty\npractised by the Roman tyrants.\n\nFor my part, even in justice itself, all that exceeds a simple death\nappears to me pure cruelty; especially in us who ought, having regard to\ntheir souls, to dismiss them in a good and calm condition; which cannot\nbe, when we have agitated them by insufferable torments.  Not long since,\na soldier who was a prisoner, perceiving from a tower where he was shut\nup, that the people began to assemble to the place of execution, and that\nthe carpenters were busy erecting a scaffold, he presently concluded\nthat the preparation was for him, and therefore entered into a resolution\nto kill himself, but could find no instrument to assist him in his design\nexcept an old rusty cart-nail that fortune presented to him; with this he\nfirst gave himself two great wounds about his throat, but finding these\nwould not do, he presently afterwards gave himself a third in the belly,\nwhere he left the nail sticking up to the head.  The first of his keepers\nwho came in found him in this condition: yet alive, but sunk down and\nexhausted by his wounds.  To make use of time, therefore, before he\nshould die, they made haste to read his sentence; which having done, and\nhe hearing that he was only condemned to be beheaded, he seemed to take\nnew courage, accepted wine which he had before refused, and thanked his\njudges for the unhoped-for mildness of their sentence; saying, that he\nhad taken a resolution to despatch himself for fear of a more severe and\ninsupportable death, having entertained an opinion, by the preparations\nhe had seen in the place, that they were resolved to torment him with\nsome horrible execution, and seemed to be delivered from death in having\nit changed from what he apprehended.\n\nI should advise that those examples of severity by which \u2018tis designed to\nretain the people in their duty, might be exercised upon the dead bodies\nof criminals; for to see them deprived of sepulture, to see them boiled\nand divided into quarters, would almost work as much upon the vulgar, as\nthe pain they make the living endure; though that in effect be little or\nnothing, as God himself says, \u201cWho kill the body, and after that have no\nmore that they can do;\u201d--[Luke, xii.  4.]--and the poets singularly\ndwell upon the horrors of this picture, as something worse than death:\n\n         \u201cHeu! reliquias semiustas regis, denudatis ossibus,\n          Per terram sanie delibutas foede divexarier.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cAlas! that the half-burnt remains of the king, exposing his bones,\n     should be foully dragged along the ground besmeared with gore.\u201d\n      --Cicero, Tusc. Quaes., i. 44.]\n\nI happened to come by one day accidentally at Rome, just as they were\nupon executing Catena, a notorious robber: he was strangled without any\nemotion of the spectators, but when they came to cut him in quarters, the\nhangman gave not a blow that the people did not follow with a doleful cry\nand exclamation, as if every one had lent his sense of feeling to the\nmiserable carcase.  Those inhuman excesses ought to be exercised upon the\nbark, and not upon the quick.  Artaxerxes, in almost a like case,\nmoderated the severity of the ancient laws of Persia, ordaining that the\nnobility who had committed a fault, instead of being whipped, as they\nwere used to be, should be stripped only and their clothes whipped for\nthem; and that whereas they were wont to tear off their hair, they should\nonly take off their high-crowned tiara.\u2019--[Plutarch, Notable Sayings of\nthe Ancient King.]--The so devout Egyptians thought they sufficiently\nsatisfied the divine justice by sacrificing hogs in effigy and\nrepresentation; a bold invention to pay God so essential a substance in\npicture only and in show.\n\nI live in a time wherein we abound in incredible examples of this vice,\nthrough the licence of our civil wars; and we see nothing in ancient\nhistories more extreme than what we have proof of every day, but I\ncannot, any the more, get used to it.  I could hardly persuade myself,\nbefore I saw it with my eyes, that there could be found souls so cruel\nand fell, who, for the sole pleasure of murder, would commit it; would\nhack and lop off the limbs of others; sharpen their wits to invent\nunusual torments and new kinds of death, without hatred, without profit,\nand for no other end but only to enjoy the pleasant spectacle of the\ngestures and motions, the lamentable groans and cries of a man dying in\nanguish.  For this is the utmost point to which cruelty can arrive:\n\n              \u201cUt homo hominem, non iratus, non timens,\n               tantum spectaturus, occidat.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThat a man should kill a man, not being angry, not in fear, only\n     for the sake of the spectacle.\u201d--Seneca, Ep., 90.]\n\nFor my own part, I cannot without grief see so much as an innocent beast\npursued and killed that has no defence, and from which we have received\nno offence at all; and that which frequently happens, that the stag we\nhunt, finding himself weak and out of breath, and seeing no other remedy,\nsurrenders himself to us who pursue him, imploring mercy by his tears:\n\n                        \u201cQuestuque cruentus,\n                         Atque imploranti similis,\u201d\n\n          [\u201cWho, bleeding, by his tears seems to crave mercy.\u201d\n           --AEnead, vii. 501.]\n\nhas ever been to me a very unpleasing sight; and I hardly ever take a\nbeast alive that I do not presently turn out again.  Pythagoras bought\nthem of fishermen and fowlers to do the same:\n\n                    \u201cPrimoque a caede ferarum,\n               Incaluisse puto maculatum sanguine ferrum.\u201d\n\n\n     [\u201cI think \u2018twas slaughter of wild beasts that first stained the\n     steel of man with blood.\u201d--Ovid, Met., xv. 106.]\n\nThose natures that are sanguinary towards beasts discover a natural\nproneness to cruelty.  After they had accustomed themselves at Rome to\nspectacles of the slaughter of animals, they proceeded to those of the\nslaughter of men, of gladiators.  Nature has herself, I fear, imprinted\nin man a kind of instinct to inhumanity; nobody takes pleasure in seeing\nbeasts play with and caress one another, but every one is delighted with\nseeing them dismember, and tear one another to pieces.  And that I may\nnot be laughed at for the sympathy I have with them, theology itself\nenjoins us some favour in their behalf; and considering that one and the\nsame master has lodged us together in this palace for his service, and\nthat they, as well as we, are of his family, it has reason to enjoin us\nsome affection and regard to them.  Pythagoras borrowed the\nmetempsychosis from the Egyptians; but it has since been received by\nseveral nations, and particularly by our Druids:\n\n          \u201cMorte carent animae; semperque, priore relicts\n          Sede, novis domibus vivunt, habitantque receptae.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cSouls never die, but, having left their former seat, live\n     and are received into new homes.\u201d--Ovid, Met., xv. 158.]\n\nThe religion of our ancient Gauls maintained that souls, being eternal,\nnever ceased to remove and shift their places from one body to another;\nmixing moreover with this fancy some consideration of divine justice; for\naccording to the deportments of the soul, whilst it had been in\nAlexander, they said that God assigned it another body to inhabit, more\nor less painful, and proper for its condition:\n\n                              \u201cMuta ferarum\n               Cogit vincla pati; truculentos ingerit ursis,\n               Praedonesque lupis; fallaces vulpibus addit:\n               Atque ubi per varios annos, per mille figuras\n\n               Egit, Lethaeo purgatos flumine, tandem\n               Rursus ad humanae revocat primordia formae:\u201d\n\n     [\u201cHe makes them wear the silent chains of brutes, the bloodthirsty\n     souls he encloses in bears, the thieves in wolves, the deceivers in\n     foxes; where, after successive years and a thousand forms, man had\n     spent his life, and after purgation in Lethe\u2019s flood, at last he\n     restores them to the primordial human shapes.\u201d\n      --Claudian, In Ruf., ii. 482.]\n\nIf it had been valiant, he lodged it in the body of a lion; if\nvoluptuous, in that of a hog; if timorous, in that of a hart or hare; if\nmalicious, in that of a fox, and so of the rest, till having purified it\nby this chastisement, it again entered into the body of some other man:\n\n               \u201cIpse ego nam memini, Trojani, tempore belli\n               Panthoides Euphorbus eram.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cFor I myself remember that, in the days of the Trojan war, I was\n     Euphorbus, son of Pantheus.\u201d--Ovid, Met., xv. 160; and see Diogenes\n     Laertius, Life of Pythagoras.]\n\nAs to the relationship betwixt us and beasts, I do not much admit of it;\nnor of that which several nations, and those among the most ancient and\nmost noble, have practised, who have not only received brutes into their\nsociety and companionship, but have given them a rank infinitely above\nthemselves, esteeming them one while familiars and favourites of the\ngods, and having them in more than human reverence and respect; others\nacknowledged no other god or divinity than they:\n\n          \u201cBellux a barbaris propter beneficium consecratae.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cBeasts, out of opinion of some benefit received by them, were\n     consecrated by barbarians\u201d--Cicero, De Natura Deor., i. 36.]\n\n\n                              \u201cCrocodilon adorat\n               Pars haec; illa pavet saturam serpentibus ibin:\n               Effigies sacri hic nitet aurea cercopitheci;\n                              Hic piscem flumints, illic\n               Oppida tota canem venerantur.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThis place adores the crocodile; another dreads the ibis, feeder\n     on serpents; here shines the golden image of the sacred ape; here\n     men venerate the fish of the river; there whole towns worship a\n     dog.\u201d--Juvenal, xv. 2.]\n\nAnd the very interpretation that Plutarch, gives to this error, which is\nvery well conceived, is advantageous to them: for he says that it was not\nthe cat or the ox, for example, that the Egyptians adored: but that they,\nin those beasts, adored some image of the divine faculties; in this,\npatience and utility: in that, vivacity, or, as with our neighbours the\nBurgundians and all the Germans, impatience to see themselves shut up; by\nwhich they represented liberty, which they loved and adored above all\nother godlike attributes, and so of the rest.  But when, amongst the more\nmoderate opinions, I meet with arguments that endeavour to demonstrate\nthe near resemblance betwixt us and animals, how large a share they have\nin our greatest privileges, and with how much probability they compare us\ntogether, truly I abate a great deal of our presumption, and willingly\nresign that imaginary sovereignty that is attributed to us over other\ncreatures.\n\nBut supposing all this were not true, there is nevertheless a certain\nrespect, a general duty of humanity, not only to beasts that have life\nand sense, but even to trees, and plants.  We owe justice to men, and\ngraciousness and benignity to other creatures that are capable of it;\nthere is a certain commerce and mutual obligation betwixt them and us.\nNor shall I be afraid to confess the tenderness of my nature so childish,\nthat I cannot well refuse to play with my dog, when he the most\nunseasonably importunes me to do so.  The Turks have alms and hospitals\nfor beasts.  The Romans had public care to the nourishment of geese, by\nwhose vigilance their Capitol had been preserved.  The Athenians made a\ndecree that the mules and moyls which had served at the building of the\ntemple called Hecatompedon should be free and suffered to pasture at\ntheir own choice, without hindrance.  The Agrigentines  had a common use\nsolemnly to inter the beasts they had a kindness for, as horses of some\nrare quality, dogs, and useful birds, and even those that had only been\nkept to divert their children; and the magnificence that was ordinary\nwith them in all other things, also particularly appeared in the\nsumptuosity and numbers of monuments erected to this end, and which\nremained in their beauty several ages after.  The Egyptians buried\nwolves, bears, crocodiles, dogs, and cats in sacred places, embalmed\ntheir bodies, and put on mourning at their death.  Cimon gave an\nhonourable sepulture to the mares with which he had three times gained\nthe prize of the course at the Olympic Games.  The ancient Xantippus\ncaused his dog to be interred on an eminence near the sea, which has ever\nsince retained the name, and Plutarch says, that he had a scruple about\nselling for a small profit to the slaughterer an ox that had been long in\nhis service.\n\n\n\nChapter XII.  Apology For Raimond Sebond.\n\nLearning is, indeed, a very great and a very material accomplishment;\nand those who despise it sufficiently discover their own want of\nunderstanding; but learning yet I do not prize it at the excessive rate\nthat some others do, as Herillus, the philosopher, for one, who therein\nplaces the sovereign good, and maintained \u201cThat it was only in her to\nrender us wise and contented,\u201d which I do not believe; no more than I\ndo what others have said, that learning is the mother of all virtue, and\nthat all vice proceeds from ignorance, which, if it be true, required\na very long interpretation. My house has long-been open to men of\nknowledge, and is very well known to them; for my father, who governed\nit fifty years and upwards, inflamed with the new ardour with which\nFrancis the First embraced letters, and brought them into esteem, with\ngreat diligence and expense hunted after the acquaintance of learned\nmen, receiving them into his house as persons sacred, and that had some\nparticular inspiration of divine wisdom; collecting their sayings and\nsentences as so many oracles, and with so much the greater reverence\nand religion as he was the less able to judge of them; for he had no\nknowledge of letters any more than his predecessors. For my part I love\nthem well, but I do not adore them. Amongst others, Peter Bunel, a man\nof great reputation for knowledge in his time, having, with some others\nof his sort, staid some days at Montaigne in my father\u2019s company,\nhe presented him at his departure with a book, entitled _Theologia\nnaturalis; sive Liber Creaturarum, magistri Raimondi de Sebonde._ And as\nthe Italian and Spanish tongues were familiar to my father, and as this\nbook was written in a sort of jargon of Spanish with Latin terminations,\nhe hoped that, with a little help, he might be able to understand it,\nand therefore recommended it to him for a very useful book, and proper\ntor the time wherein he gave it to him; which was when the novel\ndoctrines of Luther began to be in vogue, and in many places to stagger\nour ancient belief: wherein he was very well advised, wisely, in his own\nreason, foreseeing that the beginning of this distemper would easily\nrun into an execrable atheism, for the vulgar, not having the faculty of\njudging of things, suffering themselves to be carried away by chance and\nappearance, after having once been inspired with the boldness to\ndespise and control those opinions which they had before had in extreme\nreverence, such as those wherein their salvation is concerned, and\nthat some of the articles of their religion are brought into doubt and\ndispute, they afterwards throw all other parts of their belief into the\nsame uncertainty, they having with them no other authority or foundation\nthan the others they had already discomposed; and shake off all the\nimpressions they had received from the authority of the laws, or the\nreverence of the ancient customs, as a tyrannical yoke:\n\n\n   Nam cupide eonculcatur nimis ante metutum;\n\n\n   \u201cFor with most eagerness they spurn the law,\n   By which they were before most kept in awe;\u201d\n\n\nresolving to admit nothing for the future to which they had not first\ninterposed their own decrees, and given their particular consent.\n\nIt happened that my father, a little before his death, having\naccidentally found this book under a heap of other neglected papers,\ncommanded me to translate it for him into French. It is good too\ntranslate such authors as this, where there is little but the matter\nitself to express; but such wherein grace of language and elegance of\nstyle are aimed at, are dangerous to attempt, especially when a man is\nto turn them into a weaker idiom. It was a strange and a new undertaking\nfor me; but having by chance at that time nothing else to do, and not\nbeing able to resist the command of the best father that ever was, I did\nit as well as I could; and he was so well pleased with it as to order it\nto be printed, which after his death was done.\n\nI found the ideas of this author exceeding fine the contexture of his\nwork well followed, and his design full of piety; and because many\npeople take a delight to read it, and particularly the ladies, to whom\nwe owe the most service, I have often thought to assist them to clear\nthe book of two principal objections made to it. His design is bold and\ndaring, for he undertakes, by human and natural reasons, to establish\nand make good, against the atheists, all the articles of the Christian\nreligion: wherein, to speak the truth, he is so firm and so successful\nthat I do not think it possible to do better upon that subject; nay, I\nbelieve he has been equalled by none. This work seeming to me to be too\nbeautiful and too rich for an author whose name is so little known, and\nof whom all that we know is that he was a Spaniard, practising physic at\nToulouse about two hundred years ago; I enquired of Adrian Turnebus, who\nknew all things, what he thought of that book; who made answer, \u201cThat he\nthought it was some abstract drawn from St. Thomas d\u2019Aquin; for that, in\ntruth, his mind, so full of infinite erudition and admirable subtlety,\nwas alone capable of such thoughts.\u201d Be this as it may, whoever was the\nauthor and inventor (and \u2018tis not reasonable, without greater certainty,\nto deprive Sebond of that title), he was a man of great judgment and\nmost admirable parts.\n\nThe first thing they reprehend in his work is \u201cThat Christians are to\nblame to repose their belief upon human reason, which is only conceived\nby faith and the particular inspiration of divine grace.\u201d In which\nobjection there appears to be something of zeal to piety, and therefore\nwe are to endeavour to satisfy those who put it forth with the greater\nmildness and respect. This were a task more proper for a man well\nread in divinity than for me, who know nothing of it; nevertheless, I\nconceive that in a thing so divine, so high, and so far transcending\nall human intelligence, as is that truth, with which it has pleased\nthe bounty of God to enlighten us, it is very necessary that he should\nmoreover lend us his assistance, as a very extraordinary favour and\nprivilege, to conceive and imprint it in our understanding. And I do\nnot believe that means purely human are in any sort capable of doing it:\nfor, if they were, so many rare and excellent souls, and so abundantly\nfurnished with natural force, in former ages, could not have failed,\nby their reason, to arrive at this knowledge. \u2018Tis faith alone that\nlivelily mind certainly comprehends the deep mysteries of our religion;\nbut, withal, I do not say that it is not a worthy and very laudable\nattempt to accommodate those natural and human utensils with which God\nhas endowed us to the service of our faith: it is not to be doubted but\nthat it is the most noble use we can put them to; and that there is not\na design in a Christian man more noble than to make it the aim and end\nof all his studies to extend and amplify the truth of his belief. We do\nnot satisfy ourselves with serving God with our souls and understandings\nonly, we moreover owe and render him a corporal reverence, and apply our\nlimbs and motions, and external things to do him honour; we must here\ndo the same, and accompany our faith with all the reason we have, but\nalways with this reservation, not to fancy that it is upon us that\nit depends, nor that our arguments and endeavours can arrive at so\nsupernatural and divine a knowledge. If it enters not into us by an\nextraordinary infusion; if it enters not only by reason, but, moreover,\nby human ways, it is not in us in its true dignity and splendour: and\nyet, I am afraid, we only have it by this way.\n\nIf we hold upon God by the mediation of a lively faith; if we hold upon\nGod by him, and not by us; if we had a divine basis and foundation,\nhuman occasions would not have the power to shake us as they do; our\nfortress would not surrender to so weak a battery; the love of novelty,\nthe constraint of princes, the success of one party, and the rash and\nfortuitous change of our opinions, would not have the power to stagger\nand alter our belief: we should not then leave it to the mercy of every\nnew argument, nor abandon it to all the rhetoric in the world; we should\nwithstand the fury of these waves with an immovable and unyielding\nconstancy:\n\n\n   As a great rock repels the rolling tides,\n\n   That foam and bark about her marble sides,\n   From its strong bulk\n\n\nIf we were but touched with this ray of divinity, it would appear\nthroughout; not only our words, but our works also, would carry\nits brightness and lustre; whatever proceeded from us would be seen\nilluminated with this noble light. We ought to be ashamed that, in all\nthe human sects, there never was any of the faction, that did not, in\nsome measure, conform his life and behaviour to it, whereas so divine\nand heavenly an institution does only distinguish Christians by the\nname! Will you see the proof of this? Compare our manners to those of a\nMahometan or Pagan, you will still find that we fall very\n\nshort; there, where, out of regard to the reputation and advantage of\nour religion, we ought to shine in excellency at a vast distance beyond\nall others: and that it should be said of us, \u201cAre they so just, so\ncharitable, so good: Then they are Christians.\u201d All other signs are\ncommon to all religions; hope, trust, events, ceremonies, penance,\n\nmartyrs. The peculiar mark of our truth ought to be our virtue, as it\nis also the most heavenly and difficult, and the most worthy product\nof truth. For this our good St. Louis was in the right, who, when the\nTartar king, who was become Christian, designed to come to Lyons to kiss\nthe Pope\u2019s feet, and there to be an eye-witness of the sanctity he hoped\nto find in our manner, immediately diverted him from his purpose; for\nfear lest our disorderly way of living should, on the contrary, put\nhim out of conceit with so holy a belief! And yet it happened quite\notherwise since to that other, who, going to Rome, to the same end, and\nthere seeing the dissoluteness of the prelates and people of that time,\nsettled himself so much the more firmly in our religion, considering\nhow great the force and divinity of it must necessarily be that could\nmaintain its dignity and splendour among so much corruption, and in so\nvicious hands. If we had but one single grain of faith, we should remove\nmountains from their places, saith the sacred Word; our actions, that\nwould then be directed and accompanied by the divinity, would not be\nmerely human, they would have in them something of miraculous, as well\nas our belief: _Brevis est institutio vit\u00e6 honest\u00e6 beau\u00e6que, si\ncredos._ \u201cBelieve, and the way to happiness and virtue is a short one.\u201d\n Some impose upon the world that they believe that which they do not;\nothers, more in number, make themselves believe that they believe, not\nbeing able to penetrate into what it is to believe. We think it strange\nif, in the civil war which, at this time, disorders our state, we see\nevents float and vary aller a common and ordinary manner; which is\nbecause we bring nothing to it but our own. Justice, which is in one\nparty, is only there for ornament and palliation; it, is, indeed,\npretended, but \u2018tis not there received, settled and espoused: it is\nthere, as in the mouth of an advocate, not as in the heart and affection\nof the party. God owes his extraordinary assistance to faith and\nreligion; not to our passions. Men there are the conductors, and therein\nserve themselves with religion, whereas it ought to be quite contrary.\nObserve, if it be not by our own hands that we guide and train it, and\ndraw it like wax into so many contrary figures, from a rule in itself so\ndirect and firm. When and where was this more manifest than in France in\nour days? They who have taken it on the left hand, they who have taken\nit on the right; they who call it black, they who call it white, alike\nemploy it to their violent and ambitious designs, conduct it with\na progress, so conform in riot and injustice that they render the\ndiversity they pretended in their opinions, in a thing whereon the\nconduct and rule of our life depends, doubtful and hard to believe. Did\none ever see, come from the same school and discipline, manners more\nunited, and more the same? Do but observe with what horrid impudence\nwe toss divine arguments to and fro, and how irreligiously we have both\nrejected and retaken them, accord--as fortune has shifted our places in\nthese intestine storms.\n\nThis so solemn proposition, \u201cWhether it be lawful for a subject to rebel\nand take up arms against his prince for the defence of his religion,\u201d do\nyou remember in whose mouths, the last year, the affirmative of it\nwas the prop of one party, and the negative the pillar of another? And\nhearken now from what quarter comes the voice and instruction of the\none and the other, and if arms make less noise and rattle for this cause\nthan for that. We condemn those to the fire who say that truth must be\nmade to bear the yoke of our necessity; and how much worse does France\nthan say it? Let us confess the truth; whoever should draw out from the\narmy, even that raised by the king, those who take up arms out of pure\nzeal to religion, and also those who only do it to protect the laws of\ntheir country, or for the service of their prince, could hardly, out\nof both these put together, make one complete company of gens-d\u2019armes.\nWhence does this proceed, that there are so few to be found who have\nmaintained the same will and the same progress in our civil commotions,\nand that we see them one while move but a foot-pace, and another run\nfull speed? and the same men one while damage our affairs by their\nviolent heat and fierceness, and another by their coldness, gentleness,\nand slowness; but that they are pushed on by particular and casual\nconsiderations, according to the variety wherein they move?\n\nI evidently perceive that we do not willingly afford devotion any other\noffices but those that least suit with our own passions.\n\nThere hostility so admirable as the Christian. Our zeal performs\nwonders, when it seconds our inclinations to hatred, cruelty, ambition,\navarice, detraction, and rebellion: but when it moves, against the hair,\ntowards bounty, benignity, and temperance, unless, by miracle, some\nrare and virtuous disposition prompts us to it, we stir neither hand nor\ntoot. Our religion is intended to extirpate vices, whereas it screens,\nnourishes, and incites them. We must not mock God. If we believed in\nhim, I do not say by faith, but with a simple belief, that is to say\n(and I speak it to our great shame) if we believed in him and recognised\nhim as we do any other history, or as we would do one of our companions,\nwe should love him above all other things for the infinite bounty and\nbeauty that shines in him;--at least, he would go equal in our affection\nwith riches, pleasure, glory, and our friends. The best of us is not so\nmuch afraid to outrage him as he is afraid to injure his neighbour, his\nkinsman, or his master. Is there any understanding so weak that, having\non one side the object of one of our vicious pleasures, and on the other\n(in equal knowledge and persuasion) the state of an immortal glory,\nwould change the first for the other? and yet we often renounce this out\nof mere contempt: for what lust tempts us to blaspheme, if not, perhaps,\nthe very desire to offend. The philosopher Antisthenes, as he was being\ninitiated in the mysteries of Orpheus, the priest telling him, \u201cThat\nthose who professed themselves of that religion were certain to receive\nperfect and eternal felicity after death,\u201d--\u201cIf thou believest that,\u201d\n answered he, \u201cwhy dost thou not die thyself?\u201d Diogenes, more rudely,\naccording to his manner, and more remote from our purpose, to the priest\nthat in like manner preached to him, \u201cTo become of his religion, that he\nmight obtain the happiness of the other world;--\u201cWhat!\u201d said he, \u201cthou\nwouldest have me to believe that Agesilaus and Epaminondas, who were so\ngreat men, shall be miserable, and that thou, who art but a calf, and\ncanst do nothing to purpose, shalt be happy, because thou art a priest?\u201d\n Did we receive these great promises of eternal beatitude with the same\nreverence and respect that we do a philosophical discourse, we should\nnot have death in so great horror:\n\n\n   Non jam se moriens dissolvi conqurreretur;\n   Sed magis ire foras, stemque relinquere ut angais,\n   Gauderet, prealonga senex aut cornua cervus.\n\n   \u201cWe should not on a death bed grieve to be\n   Dissolved, but rather launch out cheerfully\n   From our old hut, and with the snake, be glad\n   To cast off the corrupted slough we had;\n   Or with th\u2019 old stag rejoice to be now clear\n   From the large horns, too ponderous grown to bear.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cI desire to be dissolved,\u201d we should say, \u201cand to be with Jesus Christ\u201d\n The force of Plato\u2019s arguments concerning the immortality of the soul\nset some of his disciples to seek a premature grave, that they might the\nsooner enjoy the things he had made them hope for.\n\nAll this is a most evident sign that we only receive our religion\nafter our own fashion, by our own hands, and no otherwise than as other\nreligions are received. Either we are happened in the country where it\nis in practice, or we reverence the antiquity of it, or the authority\nof the men who have maintained it, or fear the menaces it fulminates\nagainst misbelievers, or are allured by its promises. These\nconsiderations ought, \u2018tis true, to be applied to our belief but as\nsubsidiaries only, for they are human obligations. Another religion,\nother witnesses, the like promises and threats, might, by the same way,\nimprint a quite contrary belief. We are Christians by the same title\nthat we are Perigordians or Germans. And what Plato says, \u201cThat there\nare few men so obstinate in their atheism whom a pressing danger will\nnot reduce to an acknowledgment of the divine power,\u201d does not concern\na true Christian: \u2018tis for mortal and human religions to be received by\nhuman recommendation. What kind of faith can that be that cowardice and\nwant of courage establish in us? A pleasant faith, that does not believe\nwhat it believes but for want of courage to disbelieve it! Can a vicious\npassion, such as inconstancy and astonishment, cause any regular product\nin our souls? \u201cThey are confident in their judgment,\u201d says he, \u201cthat\nwhat is said of hell and future torments is all feigned: but an occasion\nof making the expedient presenting itself, when old age or diseases\nbring them to the brink of the grave, the terror of death, by the horror\nof that future condition, inspires them with a new belief!\u201d And by\nreason that such impressions render them timorous, he forbids in his\n_Laws_ all such threatening doctrines, and all persuasion that anything\nof ill can befall a man from the gods, excepting for his great good when\nthey happen to him, and for a medicinal effect. They say of Bion that,\ninfected with the atheism of Theodoras, he had long had religious men in\ngreat scorn and contempt, but that death surprising him, he gave\nhimself up to the most extreme superstition; as if the gods withdrew and\nreturned according to the necessities of Bion. Plato and these examples\nwould conclude that we are brought to a belief of God either by reason\nor by force. Atheism being a proposition as unnatural as monstrous,\ndifficult also and hard to establish in the human understanding, how\narrogant soever, there are men enough seen, out of vanity and pride, to\nbe the authors of extraordinary and reforming opinions, and outwardly\nto affect the profession of them; who, if they are such fools, have,\nnevertheless, not the power to plant them in their own conscience. Yet\nwill they not fail to lift up their hands towards heaven if you give\nthem a good thrust with a sword in the breast, and when fear or sickness\nhas abated and dulled the licentious fury of this giddy humour they will\neasily re-unite, and very discreetly suffer themselves to be reconciled\nto the public faith and examples. A doctrine seriously digested is one\nthing, and those superficial impressions another; which springing from\nthe disorder of an unhinged understanding, float at random and great\nuncertainty in the fancy. Miserable and senseless men, who strive to be\nworse than they can!\n\nThe error of paganism and the ignorance of our sacred truth, let this\ngreat soul of Plato, but great only in human greatness, fall also into\nthis other mistake, \u201cThat children and old men were most susceptible of\nreligion,\u201d as if it sprung and derived its credit from our weakness.\nThe knot that ought to bind the judgment and the will, that ought to\nrestrain the soul and join it to our creator, should be a knot that\nderives its foldings and strength not from our considerations, from our\nreasons and passions, but from a divine and supernatural constraint,\nhaving but one form, one face, and one lustre, which is the authority\nof God and his divine grace. Now the heart and soul being governed and\ncommanded by faith, \u2018tis but reason that they should muster all our\nother faculties, according as they are able to perform to the service\nand assistance of their design. Neither is it to be imagined that all\nthis machine has not some marks imprinted upon it by the hand of the\nmighty architect, and that there is not in the things of this world\nsome image that in some measure resembles the workman who has built and\nformed them. He has, in his stupendous works, left the character of his\ndivinity, and \u2018tis our own weakness only that hinders us from discerning\nit. \u2018Tis what he himself is pleased to tell us, \u201cThat he manifests his\ninvisible operations to us by those that are visible.\u201d Sebond applied\nhimself to this laudable and noble study, and demonstrates to us that\nthere is not any part or member of the world that disclaims or derogates\nfrom its maker. It were to do wrong to the divine goodness, did not the\nuniverse consent to our belief. The heavens, the earth, the elements,\nour bodies and our souls,--all things concur to this; we have but to\nfind out the way to use them; they instruct us, if we are capable\nof instruction. For this world is a sacred temple, into which man is\nintroduced, there to contemplate statues, not the works of a mortal\nhand, but such as the divine purpose has made the objects of sense; the\nsun, the stars, the water, and the earth, to represent those that are\nintelligible to us. \u201cThe invisible tilings of God,\u201d says St. Paul,\n\u201cappear by the creation of the world, his eternal wisdom and divinity\nbeing considered by his works.\u201d\n\n\n   And God himself envies not men the grace\n   Of seeing and admiring heaven\u2019s face;\n   But, rolling it about, he still anew\n   Presents its varied splendour to our view,\n   And on oar minds himself inculcates, so\n   That we th\u2019 Almighty mover well may know:\n   Instructing us by seeing him the cause\n   Of ill, to revcreoce and obey his laws.\u201d\n\n\nNow our prayers and human discourses are but as sterile and undigested\nmatter. The grace of God is the form; \u2018tis that which gives fashion and\nvalue to it. As the virtuous actions of Socrates and Cato remain vain\nand fruitless, for not having had the love and obedience to the true\ncreator of all things, so is it with our imaginations and discourses;\nthey have a kind of body, but it is an inform mass, without fashion and\nwithout light, if faith and grace be not added thereto. Faith coming to\ntinct and illustrate Sehond\u2019s arguments renders them firm and stolid;\nand to that degree that they are capable of serving for directions, and\nof being the first guides to an elementary Christian to put him into the\nway of this knowledge. They in some measure form him to, and render him\ncapable of, the grace of God, by which means he afterwards completes and\nperfects himself in the true belief. I know a man of authority, bred up\nto letters, who has confessed to me to have been brought back from the\nerrors of unbelief by Sebond\u2019s arguments. And should they be stripped of\nthis ornament, and of the assistance and approbation of the faith,\nand be looked upon as mere fancies only, to contend with those who are\nprecipitated into the dreadful and horrible darkness of irr\u00e9ligion, they\nwill even there find them as solid and firm as any others of the same\nquality that can be opposed against them; so that we shall be ready to\nsay to our opponents:\n\n\n   Si melius quid habes, arcesse; vel imperium fer:\n\n      \u201cIf you have arguments more fit.\n   Produce them, or to these submit.\u201d\n\n\nlet them admit the force of our reasons, or let them show us others,\nand upon some other subject, better woven and of finer thread. I am,\nunawares, half engaged in the second objection, to which I proposed to\nmake answer in the behalf of Sebond. Some say that his arguments are\nweak, and unable to make good what he intends, and undertake with great\nease to confute them. These are to be a little more roughly handled, for\nthey are more dangerous and malicious than the first Men willingly wrest\nthe sayings of others to favour their own prejudicate opinions. To an\natheist all writings tend to atheis\u00efm: he corrupts the most innocent\nmatter with his own venom. These have their judgments so prepossessed\nthat they cannot relish Sebond\u2019s reasons. As to the rest, they think we\ngive them very fair play in putting them into the liberty of combatting\nour religion with weapons merely human, whom, in her majesty, full of\nauthority and command, they durst not attack. The means that I shall\nuse, and that I think most proper to subdue this frenzy, is to crush and\nspurn under foot pride and human arrogance; to make them sensible of\nthe inanity, vanity, and vileness of man; to wrest the wretched arms\nof their reason out of their hands; to make them bow down and bite the\nground under the authority and reverence of the Divine Majesty. \u2018Tis to\nthat alone that knowledge and wisdom appertain; that alone that can make\na true estimate of itself, and from which we purloin whatever we value\nourselves upon: [--Greek--] \u201cGod permits not any being but himself to be\ntruly wise.\u201d Let us subdue this presumption, the first foundation of the\ntyranny of the evil spirit _Deus superbis re-sistit, humilibus autem\ndal gratiam._ \u201cGod resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble.\u201d\n \u201cUnderstanding is in the gods,\u201d says Plato, \u201cand not at all, or very\nlittle, in men.\u201d Now it is in the mean time a great consolation to a\nChristian man to see our frail and mortal parts so fitly suited to our\nholy and divine faith that, when we employ them to the subjects of their\nown mortal and frail nature they are not even there more unitedly or\nmore firmly adjusted. Let us see, then, if man has in his power other\nmore forcible and convincing reasons than those of Sebond; that is to\nsay, if it be in him to arrive at any certainty by argument and reason.\nFor St. Augustin, disputing against these people, has good cause to\nreproach them with injustice, \u201cIn that they maintain the part of our\nbelief to be false that our reason cannot establish.\u201d And to show that\na great many things may be, and have been, of which our nature could\nnot sound the reason and causes, he proposes to them certain known and\nundoubted experiments, wherein men confess they see nothing; and this he\ndoes, as all other things, with a curious and ingenious inquisition.\nWe must do more than this, and make them know that, to convince the\nweakness of their reason, there is no necessity of culling out uncommon\nexamples: and that it is so defective and so blind that there is no\nfaculty clear enough for it; that to it the easy and the hard are all\none; that all subjects equally, and nature in general, disclaim its\nauthority and reject its mediation.\n\nWhat does truth mean when she preaches to us to fly worldly philosophy,\nwhen she so often inculcates to us, \u201cThat our wisdom is but folly in the\nsight of God: that the vainest of all vanities is man: that the man who\npresumes upon his wisdom does not yet know what wisdom is; and that man,\nwho is nothing, if he thinks himself to be anything, does seduce and\ndeceive himself.\u201d These sentences of the Holy Spirit do so clearly and\nvividly express that which I would maintain that I should need no other\nproof against men who would with all humility and obedience submit to\nhis authority: but these will be whipped at their own expense, and will\nnot suffer a man to oppose their reason but by itself.\n\nLet us then, for once, consider a man alone, without foreign assistance,\narmed only with his own proper arms, and unfurnished of the divine grace\nand wisdom, which is all his honour, strength, and the foundation of his\nbeing. Let us see how he stands in this fine equipage. Let him make me\nunderstand, by the force of his reason, upon what foundations he has\nbuilt those great advantages he thinks he has over other creatures. Who\nhas made him believe that this admirable motion of the celestial arch,\nthe eternal light of those luminaries that roll so high over his head,\nthe wondrous and fearful motions of that infinite ocean, should be\nestablished and continue so many ages for his service and convenience?\nCan any thing be imagined so ridiculous, that this miserable and\nwretched creature, who is not so much as master of himself, but subject\nto the injuries of all things, should call himself master and emperor of\nthe world, of which he has not power to know the least part, much less\nto command the whole? And the privilege which he attributes to himself\nof being the only creature in this vast fabric who has the understanding\nto discover the beauty and the paris of it; the only one who can\nreturn thanks to the architect, and keep account of the revenues and\ndisbursements of the world; who, I wonder, sealed him this patent? Let\nus see his commission for this great employment Was it granted in favour\nof the wise only? Few people will be concerned in it. Are fools and\nwicked persons worthy so extraordinary a favour, and, being the worst\npart of the world, to be preferred before the rest? Shall we believe\nthis man?--\u201cFor whose sake shall we, therefore, conclude that the world\nwas made? For theirs who have the use of reason: these are gods and men,\nthan whom certainly nothing can be better:\u201d we can never sufficiently\ndecry the impudence of this conjunction. But, wretched creature,\nwhat has he in himself worthy of such an advantage? Considering the\nincorruptible existence of the celestial bodies; beauty; magnitude, and\ncontinual revolution by so exact a rule;\n\n\n      Cum suspicimus m\u00e6ni c\u00e6lestia mundi\n   Templa super, stellisque micantibus arthera fiium,\n   El venit in mcntem lun\u00e6 solisque viarurn.\n\n      \u201cWhen we the heavenly arch above behold.\n   And the vast sky adorned with stars of gold.\n   And mark the r\u2019eglar course? that the sun\n   And moon in their alternate progress run.\u201d\n\n\nconsidering the dominion and influence those bodies have, not only over\nour lives and fortunes;\n\n\n   Facta etenim et vitas hominum suspendit ab aatris;\n\n   \u201cMen\u2019s lives and actions on the stars depend.\u201d\n\n\nbut even over our inclinations, our thoughts and wills, which they\ngovern, incite and agitate at the mercy of their influences, as our\nreason teaches us;\n\n\n      \u201cContemplating the stars he finds that they\n   Rule by a secret and a silent sway;\n   And that the enamell\u2019d spheres which roll above\n   Do ever by alternate causes move.\n   And, studying these, he can also foresee,\n   By certain signs, the turns of destiny;\u201d\n\n\nseeing that not only a man, not only kings, but that monarchies,\nempires, and all this lower world follow the influence of the celestial\nmotions,\n\n\n      \u201cHow great a change a little motion brings!\n   So great this kingdom is that governs kings:\u201d\n\n\nif our virtue, our vices, our knowledge, and this very discourse we are\nupon of the power of the stars, and the comparison we are making betwixt\nthem and us, proceed, as our reason supposes, from their favour;\n\n\n      \u201cOne mad in love may cross the raging main,\n   To level lofty Ilium with the plain;\n   Another\u2019s fate inclines him more by far\n   To study laws and statutes for the bar.\n   Sons kill their father, fathers kill their sons,\n   And one arm\u2019d brother \u2018gainst another runs..\n   This war\u2019s not their\u2019s, but fate\u2019s, that spurs them on\n   To shed the blood which, shed, they must bemoan;\n   And I ascribe it to the will of fate\n   That on this theme I now expatiate:\u201d\n\n\nif we derive this little portion of reason we have from the bounty of\nheaven, how is it possible that reason should ever make us equal to it?\nHow subject its essence and condition to our knowledge? Whatever we see\nin those bodies astonishes us: _Qu\u00e6 molitio, qua ferramenta, qui vectes,\nqu\u00e6 machina, qui ministri tanti operis fuerunt?_ \u201cWhat contrivance, what\ntools, what materials, what engines, were employed about so stupendous\na work?\u201d Why do we deprive them of soul, of life, and discourse? Have we\ndiscovered in them any immoveable or insensible stupidity, we who\nhave no commerce with them but by obedience? Shall we say that we have\ndiscovered in no other creature but man the use of a reasonable soul?\nWhat! have we seen any thing like the sun? Does he cease to be, because\nwe have seen nothing like him? And do his motions cease, because there\nare no other like them? If what we have not seen is not, our knowledge\nis marvellously contracted: _Qu\u00e6 sunt tant\u00e6 animi angusti\u00e6!_ \u201cHow narrow\nare our understandings!\u201d Are they not dreams of human vanity, to make\nthe moon a celestial earth? there to fancy mountains and vales, as\nAnaxagoras did? there to fix habitations and human abodes, and plant\ncolonies for our convenience, as Plato and Plutarch have done? And of\nour earth to make a luminous and resplendent star? \u201cAmongst the\nother inconveniences of mortality this is one, that darkness of the\nunderstanding which leads men astray, not so much from a necessity of\nerring, but from a love of error. The corruptible body stupifies\nthe soul, and the earthly habitation dulls the faculties of the\nimagination.\u201d\n\nPresumption is our natural and original disease. The most wretched and\nfrail of all creatures is man, and withal the proudest. He feels and\nsees himself lodged here in the dirt and filth of the world, nailed and\nrivetted to the worst and deadest part of the universe, in the lowest\nstory of the house, the most remote from the heavenly arch, with animals\nof the worst condition of the three; and yet in his imagination will be\nplacing himself above the circle of the moon, and bringing the heavens\nunder his feet. \u2018Tis by the same vanity of imagination that he equals\nhimself to God, attributes to himself divine qualities, withdraws and\nseparates himself from the the crowd of other creatures, cuts out the\nshares of the animals, his fellows and companions, and distributes to\nthem portions of faculties and force, as himself thinks fit How does\nhe know, by the strength of his understanding, the secret and internal\nmotions of animals?--from what comparison betwixt them and us does he\nconclude the stupidity he attributes to them? When I play with my cat\nwho knows whether I do not make her more sport than she makes me? We\nmutually divert one another with our play. If I have my hour to begin\nor to refus\u00e7, she also has hers. Plato, in his picture of the golden age\nunder Saturn, reckons, among the chief advantages that a man then had,\nhis communication with beasts, of whom, inquiring and informing himself,\nhe knew the true qualities and differences of them all, by which he\nacquired a very perfect intelligence and prudence, and led his life\nmore happily than we could do. Need we a better proof to condemn human\nimpudence in the concern of beasts? This great author was of opinion\nthat nature, for the most part in the corporal form she gave them, had\nonly regard to the use of prognostics that were derived thence in his\ntime. The defect that hinders communication betwixt them and us, why may\nit not be in our part as well as theirs? \u2018Tis yet to determine where the\nfault lies that we understand not one another,--for we understand them\nno more than they do us; and by the same reason they may think us to be\nbeasts as we think them. \u2018Tis no great wonder if we understand not them,\nwhen we do not understand a Basque or a Troglodyte. And yet some have\nboasted that they understood them, as Apollonius Tyanaus, Melampus,\nTiresias, Thales, and others. And seeing, as cusmographers report, that\nthere are nations that have a dog for their king, they must of necessity\nbe able to interpret his voice and motions. We must observe the parity\nbetwixt us, have some tolerable apprehension of their meaning, and so\nhave beasts of ours,--much about the same. They caress us, threaten us,\nand beg of us, and we do the same to them.\n\nAs to the rest, we manifestly discover that they have a full and\nabsolute communication amongst themselves, and that they perfectly\nunderstand one another, not only those of the same, but of divers kinds:\n\n\n      \u201cThe tamer herds, and wilder sort of brutes.\n   Though we of higher race conclude them mutes.\n   Yet utter dissonant and various notes,\n   From gentler lungs or more distended throats,\n   As fear, or grief, or anger, do them move,\n   Or as they do approach the joys of love.\u201d\n\n\nIn one kind of barking of a dog the horse knows there is anger, of\nanother sort of bark he is not afraid. Even in the very beasts that\nhave no voice at all, we easily conclude, from the society of offices\nwe observe amongst them, some other sort of communication: their very\nmotions discover it:\n\n\n      \u201cAs infants who, for want of words, devise\n   Expressive motions with their hands and eyes.\u201d\n\n\nAnd why not, as well as our dumb people, dispute, argue, and tell\nstories by signs? Of whom I have seen some, by practice, so clever and\nactive that way that, in fact, they wanted nothing of the perfection\nof making themselves understood. Lovers are angry, reconciled, intreat,\nthank, appoint, and, in short, speak all things by their eyes:\n\n\n      \u201cEven silence in a lover\n   Love and passion can discover.\u201d\n\n\nWhat with the hands? We require, promise, call, dismiss, threaten, pray,\nsupplicate, deny, refuse, interrogate, admire, number, confess, repent,\nfear, express confusion, doubt, instruct, command, incite, encourage,\nswear, testify, accuse, condemn, absolve, abuse, despise, defy, provoke,\nflatter, applaud, bless, submit, mock, reconcile, recommend, exalt,\nentertain, congratulate, complain, grieve, despair, wonder, exclaim, and\nwhat not! And all this with a variety and multiplication, even emulating\nspeech. With the head we invite, remand, confess, deny, give the lie,\nwelcome, honour, reverence, disdain, demand, rejoice, lament, reject,\ncaress, rebuke, submit, huff, encourage, threaten, assure, and inquire.\nWhat with the eyebrows?--what with the shoulders! There is not a motion\nthat does not speak, and in an intelligible language without discipline,\nand a public language that every one understands: whence it should\nfollow, the variety and use distinguished from others considered, that\nthese should rather be judged the property of human nature. I omit\nwhat necessity particularly does suddenly suggest to those who are in\nneed;--the alphabets upon the fingers, grammars in gesture, and the\nsciences which are only by them exercised and expressed; and the nations\nthat Pliny reports have no other language. An ambassador of the city of\nAbdera, after a long conference with Agis, King of Sparta, demanded of\nhim, \u201cWell, sir, what answer must I return to my fellow-citizens?\u201d \u201cThat\nI have given thee leave,\u201d said he, \u201cto say what thou wouldest, and as\nmuch as thou wouldest, without ever speaking a word.\u201d is not this a\nsilent speaking, and very easy to be understood?\n\nAs to the rest, what is there in us that we do not see in the operations\nof animals? Is there a polity better ordered, the offices better\ndistributed, and more inviolably observed and maintained, than that\nof bees? Can we imagine that such, and so regular, a distribution of\nemployments can be carried on without reasoning and deliberation?\n\n\n      \u201cHence to the bee some sages have assign\u2019d\n   Some portion of the god and heavenly wind.\u201d\n\n\nThe swallows that we see at the return of the spring, searching all the\ncorners of our houses for the most commodious places wherein to build\ntheir nest; do they seek without judgment, and amongst a thousand choose\nout the most proper for their purpose, without discretion? And in that\nelegant and admirable contexture of their buildings, can birds rather\nmake choice of a square figure than a round, of an obtuse than of a\nright angle, without knowing their properties and effects? Do they bring\nwater, and then clay, without knowing that the hardness of the latter\ngrows softer by being wetted? Do they mat their palace with moss or down\nwithout foreseeing that their tender young will lie more safe and easy?\nDo they secure themselves from the wet and rainy winds, and place their\nlodgings against the east, without knowing the different qualities of\nthe winds, and considering that one is more wholesome than another?\nWhy does the spider make her web tighter in one place, and slacker in\nanother; why now make one sort of knot, and then another, if she has not\ndeliberation, thought, and conclusion? We sufficiently discover in most\nof their works how much animals excel us, and how unable our art is to\nimitate them. We see, nevertheless, in our rougher performances, that we\nemploy all our faculties, and apply the utmost power of our souls; why\ndo we not conclude the same of them?\n\nWhy should we attribute to I know not what natural and servile\ninclination the works that excel all we can do by nature and art?\nwherein, without being aware, we give them a mighty advantage over us\nin making nature, with maternal gentleness and love, accompany and learn\nthem, as it were, by the hand to all the actions and commodities of\ntheir life, whilst she leaves us to chance and fortune, and to seek out\nby art the things that are necessary to our conservation, at the same\ntime denying us the means of being able, by any instruction or effort of\nunderstanding, to arrive at the natural sufficiency of beasts; so that\ntheir brutish stupidity surpasses, in all conveniences, all that our\ndivine intelligence can do. Really, at this rate, we might with great\nreason call her an unjust stepmother: but it is nothing so, our polity\nis not so irregular and unformed.\n\nNature has universally cared for all her creatures, and there is not\none she has not amply furnished with all means necessary for the\nconservation of its being. For the common complaints I hear men make (as\nthe license of their opinions one while lifts them up above the clouds,\nand then again depresses them to the antipodes), that we are the only\nanimal abandoned naked upon the bare earth, tied and bound, not having\nwherewithal to arm and clothe us but by the spoil of others; whereas\nnature has covered all other creatures either with shells, husks,\nbark, hair, wool, prickles, leather, down, feathers, scales, or silk,\naccording to the necessities of their being; has armed them with talons,\nteeth, or horns, wherewith to assault and defend, and has herself taught\nthem that which is most proper for them, to swim, to run, to fly, and\nsing, whereas man neither knows how to walk, speak, eat, or do any thing\nbut weep, without teaching;\n\n\n      \u201cLike to the wretched mariner, when toss\u2019d\n   By raging seas upon the desert coast,\n   The tender babe lies naked on the earth,\n   Of all supports of life stript by his birth;\n   When nature first presents him to the day,\n   Freed from the cell wherein before he lay,\n   He fills the ambient air with doleful cries.\n   Foretelling thus life\u2019s future miseries;\n   But beasts, both wild and tame, greater and less,\n   Do of themselves in strength and bulk increase;\n   They need no rattle, nor the broken chat,\n   Ay which the nurse first teaches boys to prate\n   They look not out for different robes to wear,\n   According to the seasons of the year;\n   And need no arms nor walls their goods to save,\n   Since earth and liberal nature ever have,\n   And will, in all abundance, still produce\n   All things whereof they can have need or use:\u201d\n\n\nthese complaints are false; there is in the polity of the world a\ngreater equality and more uniform relation. Our skins are as sufficient\nto defend us from the injuries of the weather as theirs are; witness\nseveral nations that yet know not the use of clothes. Our ancient Gauls\nwere but slenderly clad, any more than the Irish, our neighbours, though\nin so cold a climate; but we may better judge of this by ourselves: for\nall those parts that we are pleased to expose to the air are found very\nable to endure it: the face, the feet, the hands, the arms, the head,\naccording to the various habit; if there be a tender part about us,\nand that would seem to be in danger from cold, it should be the stomach\nwhere the digestion is; and yet our forefathers were there always\nopen, and our ladies, as tender and delicate as they are, go sometimes\nhalf-bare as low as the navel. Neither is the binding or swathing of\ninfants any more necessary; and the Laced\u00e6moman mothers brought theirs\nin all liberty of motion of members, without any ligature at all. Our\ncrying is common with the greatest part of other animals, and there are\nbut few creatures that are not observed to groan, and bemoan themselves\na long time after they come into the world; forasmuch as it is a\nbehaviour suitable to the weakness wherein they find themselves. As\nto the custom of eating, it is in us, as in them, natural, and without\ninstruction;\n\n\n      \u201cFor every one soon finds his natural force.\n   Which he, or better may employ, or worse.\u201d\n\n\nWho doubts but an infant, arrived to the strength of feeding himself,\nmay make shift to find something to eat And the earth produces and\noffers him wherewithal to supply his necessity, without other culture\nand artifice; and if not at all times, no more does she do it to beasts,\nwitness the provision we see ants and other creatures hoard up against\nthe dead seasons of the year. The late discovered nations, so abundantly\nfurnished with natural meat and drink, without care, or without cookery,\nmay give us to understand that bread is not our only food, and that,\nwithout tillage, our mother nature has provided us sufficiently of all\nwe stand in need of: nay, it appears more fully and plentifully than she\ndoes at present, now that we have added our own industry:\n\n\n      \u201cThe earth did first spontaneously afford\n   Choice fruits and wines to furnish out the board;\n   With herbs and flow\u2019rs unsown in verdant fields.\n   But scarce by art so good a harvest yields;\n   Though men and oxen mutually have strove,\n   With all their utmost force the soil t\u2019 improve,\u201d\n\n\nthe debauchery and irregularity of our appetites outstrips all the\ninventions we can contrive to satisfy it.\n\nAs to arms, we have more natural ones than than most other animals more\nvarious motions of limbs, and naturally and without lesson extract more\nservice from them. Those that are trained to fight naked are seen\nto throw themselves into the like hazards that we do. If some beasts\nsurpass us in this advantage, we surpass many others. And the industry\nof fortifying the body, and covering it by acquired means, we have by\ninstinct and natural precept? That it is so, the elephant shows\nwho sharpen, and whets the teeth he makes use of in war (for he has\nparticular ones for that service, which he spares, and never employs\nthem at all to any other use); when bulls go to fight, they toss and\nthrow the dust about them; boars whet their tusks; and the ichneumon,\nwhen he is about to engage with the crocodile, fortifies his body,\nand covers and crusts it all over with close-wrought and well-tempered\nslime, as with a cuirass. Why shall we not say that it is also natural\nfor us to arm ourselves with wood and iron?\n\nAs to speech, it is certain that if it be not natural it is not\nnecessary. Nevertheless I believe that a child which had been brought up\nin an absolute solitude, remote from all society of men (which would\nbe an experiment very hard to make), would have some kind of speech to\nexpress his meaning by. And \u2018tis not to be supposed that nature should\nhave denied that to us which she has given to several other animals:\nfor what is this faculty we observe in them, of complaining, rejoicing,\ncalling to one another for succour, and inviting each other to love,\nwhich they do with the voice, other than speech? And why should they\nnot speak to one another? They speak to us, and we to them. In how many\nseveral sorts of ways do we speak to our dogs, and they answer us?\nWe converse with them in another sort of language, and use other\nappellations, than we do with birds, hogs, oxen, horses, and alter the\nidiom according to the kind.\n\n\n      \u201cThus from one swarm of ants some sally out.\n   To spy another\u2019s stock or mark its rout.\u201d\n\n\nLactantius seems to attribute to beasts not only speech, but laughter\nalso. And the difference of language which is seen amongst us, according\nto the difference of countries, is also observed in animals of the\nsame kind. Aristotle, in proof of this, instances the Various calls of\npartridges, according to the situation of places:\n\n\n      \u201cAnd various birds do from their warbling throats\n   At various times, utter quite different notes,\n   And some their hoarse songs with the seasons change.\u201d\n\n\nBut it is yet to be known what language this child would speak; and of\nthat what is said by guess has no great appearance. If a man will allege\nto me, in opposition to this opinion, that those who are naturally deaf\nspeak not, I answer that this is not only because they could not receive\nthe instruction of speaking by ear, but rather because the sense of\nhearing, of which they are deprived, relates to that of speaking, and\nthat these hold together by a natural and inseparable tie, in such\nmanner that what we speak we must first speak to ourselves within, and\nmake it sound in our own ears, before we can utter it to others.\n\nAll this I have said to prove the resemblance there is in human things,\nand to bring us back and join us to the crowd. We are neither above nor\nbelow the rest All that is under heaven, says the sage, runs one law and\none fortune:\n\n\n      \u201cAll things remain\n   Bound and entangled in one fatal chain.\u201d\n\n\nThere is, indeed, some difference,--there are several orders and\ndegrees; but it is under the aspect of one and the same nature:\n\n\n      \u201cAll things by their own rites proceed, and draw\n   Towards their ends, by nature\u2019s certain law.\u201d\n\n\nMan must be compelled and restrained within the bounds of this polity.\nMiserable creature! he is not in a condition really to step over the\nrail. He is fettered and circumscribed, he is subjected to the same\nnecessity that the other creatures of his rank and order are, and of\na very mean condition, without any prerogative of true and real\npre-eminence. That which he attributes to himself, by vain fancy and\nopinion, has neither body nor taste. And if it be so, that he only, of\nall the animals, has this liberty of imagination and irregularity of\nthoughts, representing to him that which is, that which is not, and that\nhe would have, the false and the true, \u2018tis an advantage dearly bought,\nand of which he has very little reason to be proud; for thence springs\nthe principal and original fountain of all the evils that befal\nhim,--sin, sickness, irresolution, affliction, despair. I say, then,\nto return to my subject, that there is no appearance to induce a man to\nbelieve that beasts should, by a natural and forced inclination, do the\nsame things that we do by our choice and industry. We ought from like\neffects to conclude like faculties, and from greater effects greater\nfaculties; and consequently confess that the same reasoning, and the\nsame ways by which we operate, are common with them, or that they have\nothers that are better. Why should we imagine this natural constraint in\nthem, who experience no such effect in ourselves? added that it is more\nhonourable to be guided and obliged to act regularly by a natural and\ninevitable condition, and nearer allied to the divinity, than to act\nregularly by a temerarious and fortuitous liberty, and more safe to\nentrust the reins of our conduct in the hands of nature than our\nown. The vanity of our presumption makes us prefer rather to owe our\nsufficiency to our own exertions than to her bounty, and to enrich the\nother animals with natural goods, and abjure them in their favour,\nin order to honour and ennoble ourselves with goods acquired, very\nfoolishly in my opinion; for I should as much value parts and virtues\nnaturally and purely my own as those I had begged and obtained from\neducation. It is not in our power to obtain a nobler reputation than to\nbe favoured of God and nature.\n\nFor instance, take the fox, the people of Thrace make use of when they\nwish to pass over the ice of some frozen river, and turn him out before\nthem to that purpose; when we see him lay his ear upon the bank of\nthe river, down to the ice, to listen if from a more remote or nearer\ndistance he can hear the noise of the waters\u2019 current, and, according as\nhe finds by that the ice to be of a less or greater thickness, to retire\nor advance,--have we not reason to believe thence that the same rational\nthoughts passed through his head that we should have upon the like\noccasions; and that it is a ratiocination and consequence, drawn from\nnatural sense, that that which makes a noise runs, that which runs\nis not frozen, what is not frozen is liquid, and that which is liquid\nyields to impression! For to attribute this to a mere quickness of the\nsense of hearing, without reason and consequence, is a chim\u00e6ra that\ncannot enter into the imagination. We are to suppose the same of\nthe many sorts of subtleties and inventions with which beasts secure\nthemselves from, and frustrate, the enterprizes we plot against them.\n\nAnd if we will make an advantage even of this, that it is in our power\nto seize them, to employ them in our service, and to use them at our\npleasure, \u2018tis still but the same advantage we have over one another. We\nhave our slaves upon these terms: the Climacid\u00e6, were they not women\nin Syria who, squat on all fours, served for a ladder or footstool, by\nwhich the ladies mounted their coaches? And the greatest part of free\npersons surrender, for very trivial conveniences, their life and being\ninto the power of another. The wives and concubines of the Thracians\ncontended who should be chosen to be slain upon their husband\u2019s tomb.\nHave tyrants ever failed of finding men enough vowed to their devotion?\nsome of them moreover adding this necessity, of accompanying them in\ndeath as well as life? Whole armies have bound themselves after this\nmanner to their captains. The form of the oath in the rude school of\ngladiators was in these words: \u201cWe swear to suffer ourselves to be\nchained, burnt, wounded, and killed with the sword, and to endure all\nthat true gladiators suffer from their master, religiously engaging both\nbody and soul in his service.\u201d\n\n\n      Uire meum, si vis, flamma caput, et pete ferro\n   Corpus, et iutorto verbere terga seca.\n\n      \u201cWound me with steel, or burn my head with fire.\n   Or scourge my shoulders with well-twisted wire.\u201d\n\n\nThis was an obligation indeed, and yet there, in one year, ten thousand\nentered into it, to their destruction. When the Scythians interred their\nking they strangled upon his body the most beloved of his concubines,\nhis cup-bearer, the master of his horse, his chamberlain, the usher of\nhis chamber, and his cook. And upon the anniversary thereof they killed\nfifty horses, mounted by fifty pages, that they had impaled all up the\nspine of the back to the throat, and there left them fixed in triumph\nabout his tomb. The men that serve us do it cheaper, and for a less\ncareful and favourable usage than what we treat our hawks, horses and\ndogs withal. To what solicitude do we not submit for the conveniences of\nthese? I do not think that servants of the most abject condition would\nwillingly do that for their masters that princes think it an honour to\ndo for their beasts. Diogenes seeing his relations solicitous to redeem,\nhim from servitude: \u201cThey are fools,\u201d said he; \u201c\u2018tis he that keeps and\nnourishes me that in reality serves me.\u201d And they who entertain beasts\nought rather to be said to serve them, than to be served by them. And\nwithal in this these have something more generous in that one lion\nnever submitted to another lion, nor one horse to another, for want of\ncourage. As we go to the chase of beasts, so do tigers and lions to\nthe chase of men, and do the same execution upon one another; dogs upon\nhares, pikes upon tench, swallows upon grass-hoppers, and sparrow-hawks\nupon blackbirds and larks:\n\n\n      \u201cThe stork with snakes and lizards from the wood\n   And pathless wilds supports her callow brood,\n   While Jove\u2019s own eagle, bird of noble blood,\n   Scours the wide country for undaunted food;\n   Sweeps the swift hare or swifter fawn away,\n   And feeds her nestlings with the generous prey.\u201d\n\n\nWe divide the quarry, as well as the pains and labour of the chase, with\nour hawks and hounds. And about Amphipolis, in Thrace, the hawkers and\nwild falcons equally divide the prey in the half. As also along the lake\nM\u00e6otis, if the fisherman does not honestly leave the wolves an equal\nshare of what he has caught, they presently go and tear his nets in\npieces. And as we have a way of sporting that is carried on more by\nsubtlety than force, as springing hares, and angling with line and hook,\nthere is also the like amongst other animals. Aristotle says that the\ncuttle-fish casts a gut out of her throat as long as a line, which she\nextends and draws back at pleasure; and as she perceives some little\nfish approach her she lets it nibble upon the end of this gut, lying\nherself concealed in the sand or mud, and by little and little draws it\nin, till the little fish is so near her that at one spring she may catch\nit.\n\nAs to strength, there is no creature in the world exposed to so many\ninjuries as man. We need not a whale, elephant, or a crocodile, nor any\nsuch-like animals, of which one alone is sufficient to dispatch a great\nnumber of men, to do our business; lice are sufficient to vacate Sylla\u2019s\ndictatorship; and the heart and life of a great and triumphant emperor\nis the breakfast of a little contemptible worm!\n\nWhy should we say that it is only for man, or knowledge built up by\nart and meditation, to distinguish the things useful for his being, and\nproper for the cure of his diseases, and those which are not; to know\nthe virtues of rhubarb and polypody. When we see the goats of Candia,\nwhen wounded with an arrow, among a million of plants choose out\ndittany for their cure; and the tortoise, when she has eaten a viper,\nimmediately go out to look for origanum to purge her; the dragon to rub\nand clear his eyes with fennel; the storks to give themselves clysters\nof sea-water; the elephants to draw not only out of their own bodies,\nand those of their companions, but out of the bodies of their masters\ntoo (witness the elephant of King Porus whom Alexander defeated), the\ndarts and javelins thrown at them in battle, and that so dexterously\nthat we ourselves could not do it with so little pain to the\npatient;--why do we not say here also that this is knowledge and reason?\nFor to allege, to their disparagement, that \u2018tis by the sole instruction\nand dictate of nature that they know all this, is not to take from them\nthe dignity of knowledge and reason, but with greater force to attribute\nit to them than to us, for the honour of so infallible a mistress.\nChrysippus, though in other things as scornful a judge of the condition\nof animals as any other philosopher whatever, considering the motions of\na dog, who coming to a place where three ways met, either to hunt after\nhis master he has lost, or in pursuit of some game that flies before\nhim, goes snuffing first in one of the ways, and then in another, and,\nafter having made himself sure of two, without finding the trace of\nwhat he seeks, dashes into the third without examination, is forced to\nconfess that this reasoning is in the dog: \u201cI have traced my master to\nthis place; he must of necessity be gone one of these three ways; he is\nnot gone this way nor that, he must then infallibly be gone this other;\u201d\n and that assuring himself by this conclusion, he makes no use of his\nnose in the third way, nor ever lays it to the ground, but suffers\nhimself to be carried on there bv the force of reason. This sally,\npurely logical, and this use of propositions divided and conjoined, and\nthe right enumeration of parts, is it not every whit as good that the\ndog knows all this of himself as well as from Trapezuntius?\n\nAnimals are not incapable, however, of being instructed after our\nmethod. We teach blackbirds, ravens, pies, and parrots, to speak: and\nthe facility wherewith we see they lend us their voices, and render both\nthem and their breath so supple and pliant, to be formed and confined\nwithin a certain number of letters and syllables, does evince that they\nhave a reason within, which renders them so docile and willing to learn.\nEverybody, I believe, is glutted with the several sorts of tricks that\ntumblers teach their dogs; the dances, where they do not miss any one\ncadence of the sound they hear; the several various motions and leaps\nthey make them perform by the command of a word. But I observe this\neffect with the greatest admiration, which nevertheless is very common,\nin the dogs that lead the blind, both in the country and in cities: I\nhave taken notice how they stop at certain doors, where they are wont\nto receive alms; how they avoid the encounter of coaches and carts, even\nthere where they have sufficient room to pass; I have seen them, by the\ntrench of a town, forsake a plain and even path and take a worse, only\nto keep their masters further from the ditch;--how could a man have\nmade this dog understand that it was his office to look to his master\u2019s\nsafely only, and to despise his own conveniency to serve him? And how\nhad he the knowledge that a way was wide enough for him that was not so\nfor a blind man? Can all this be apprehended without ratiocination!\n\nI must not omit what Plutarch says he saw of a dog at Rome with the\nEmperor Vespasian, the father, at the theatre of Marcellus. This dog\nserved a player, that played a farce of several parts and personages,\nand had therein his part. He had, amongst other things, to counterfeit\nhimself for some time dead, by reason of a certain drug he was supposed\nto eat After he had swallowed a piece of bread, which passed for the\ndrug, he began after awhile to tremble and stagger, as if he was taken\ngiddy: at last, stretching himself out stiff, as if dead, he suffered\nhimself to be drawn and dragged from place to place, as it was his part\nto do; and afterward, when he knew it to be time, he began first gently\nto stir, as if awaking out of a profound sleep, and lifting up his head\nlooked about him after such a manner as astonished all the spectators.\n\nThe oxen that served in the royal gardens of Susa, to water them, and\nturn certain great wheels to draw water for that purpose, to which\nbuckets were fastened (such as there are many in Languedoc), being\nordered every one to draw a hundred turns a day, they were so accustomed\nto this number that it was impossible by any force to make them draw one\nturn more; but, their task being performed, they would suddenly stop and\nstand still. We are almost men before we can count a hundred, and have\nlately discovered nations that have no knowledge of numbers at all.\n\nThere is more understanding required in the teaching of\u2019 others than in\nbeing taught. Now, setting aside what Democritus held and proved, \u201cThat\nmost of the arts we have were taught us by other animals,\u201d as by the\nspider to weave and sew; by the swallow to build; by the swan and\nnightingale music; and by several animals to make medicines:--Aristotle\nis of opinion \u201cThat the nightingales teach their young ones to sing, and\nspend a great deal of time and care in it;\u201d whence it happens that those\nwe bring up in cages, and which have not had the time to learn of their\nparents, want much of the grace of their singing: we may judge by this\nthat they improve by discipline and study; and, even amongst the wild,\nit is not all and every one alike--every one has learnt to do better\nor worse, according to their capacity. And so jealous are they one of\nanother, whilst learning, that they contention with emulation, and by\nso vigorous a contention that sometimes the vanquished fall dead upon the\nplace, the breath rather failing than the voice. The younger ruminate\npensively and begin to mutter some broken notes; the disciple listens\nto the master\u2019s lesson, and gives the best account he is able; they\nare silent oy turns; one may hear faults corrected and observe some\nreprehensions of the teacher. \u201c\u00cf have formerly seen,\u201d says Arrian, \u201can\nelephant having a cymbal hung at each leg, and another fastened to his\ntrunk, at the sound of which all the others danced round about him,\nrising and bending at certain cadences, as they were guided by\nthe instrument; and \u2018twas delightful to hear this harmony.\u201d In the\nspectacles of Rome there were ordinarily seen elephants taught to move\nand dance to the sound of the voice, dances wherein were several changes\nand cadences very hard to learn. And some have been known so intent upon\ntheir lesson as privately to practice it by themselves, that they might\nnot be chidden nor beaten by their masters.\n\nBut this other story of the pie, of which we have Plutarch himself for a\nwarrant, is very strange. She lived in a barber\u2019s shop at Rome, and did\nwonders in imitating with her voice whatever she heard. It happened one\nday that certain trumpeters stood a good while sounding before the\nshop. After that, and all the next day, the pie was pensive, dumb, and\nmelancholic; which every body wondered at, and thought the noise of the\ntrumpets had so stupified and astonished her that her voice was\ngone with her hearing. But they found at last that it was a profound\nmeditation and a retiring into herself, her thoughts exercising and\npreparing her voice to imitate the sound of those trumpets, so that the\nfirst voice she uttered was perfectly to imitate their strains, stops,\nand changes; having by this new lesson quitted and taken in disdain all\nshe had learned before.\n\nI will not omit this other example of a dog, also, which the same\nPlutarch (I am sadly confounding all order, but I do not propose\narrangement here any more than elsewhere throughout my book) which\nPlutarch says he saw on board a ship. This dog being puzzled how to get\nthe oil that was in the bottom of a jar, which he could not reach with\nhis tongue by reason of the narrow mouth of the vessel, went and fetched\nstones and let them fall into the jar till he made the oil rise so high\nthat he could reach it. What is this but an effect of a very subtle\ncapacity! \u2018Tis said that the ravens of Barbary do the same, when the\nwater they would drink is too low. This action is somewhat akin to what\nJuba, a king of their nation relates of the elephants: \u201cThat when, by\nthe craft of the hunter, one of them is trapped in certain deep pits\nprepared for them, and covered over with brush to deceive them, all the\nrest, in great diligence, bring a great many stones and logs of wood to\nraise the bottom so that he may get out.\u201d But this animal, in\nseveral other effects, comes so near to human capacity that, should I\nparticularly relate all that experience hath delivered to us, I should\neasily have what I usually maintain granted: namely, that there is more\ndifference betwixt such and such a man than betwixt such a beast and\nsuch a man. The keeper of an elephant in a private house of Syria robbed\nhim every meal of the half of his allowance. One day his master would\nhimself feed him, and poured the full measure of barley he had ordered\nfor his allowance into his manger which the elephant, casting an angry\nlook at the keeper, with his trunk separated the one-half from the\nother, and thrust it aside, by that declaring the wrong was done him.\nAnd another, having a keeper that mixed stones with his corn to make\nup the measure, came to the pot where he was boiling meat for his own\ndinner, and filled it with ashes. These are particular effects: but that\nwhich all the world has seen, and all the world knows, that in all the\narmies of the Levant one of the greatest force consisted in elephants,\nwith whom they did, without comparison, much greater execution than we\nnow do with our artillery; which takes, pretty nearly, their place in\na day of battle (as may easily be supposed by such as are well read in\nancient history);\n\n\n      \u201cThe sires of these huge animals were wont\n   The Carthaginian Hannibal to mount;\n   Our leaders also did these beasts bestride,\n   And mounted thus Pyrrhus his foes defied;\n   Nay, more, upon their backs they used to bear\n   Castles with armed cohorts to the war.\u201d\n\n\nThey must necessarily have very confidently relied upon the fidelity and\nunderstanding of these beasts when they entrusted them with the vanguard\nof a battle, where the least stop they should have made, by reason of\nthe bulk and heaviness of their bodies, and the least fright that should\nhave made them face about upon their own people, had been enough to\nspoil all: and there are but few examples where it has happened that\nthey have fallen foul upon their own troops, whereas we ourselves break\ninto our own battalions and rout one another. They had the charge not of\none simple movement only, but of many several things to be performed in\nthe battle: as the Spaniards did to their dogs in their new conquest of\nthe Indies, to whom they gave pay and allowed them a share in the spoil;\nand those animals showed as much dexterity and judgment in pursuing the\nvictory and stopping the pursuit; in charging and retiring, as occasion\nrequired; and in distinguishing their friends from their enemies, as\nthey did ardour and fierceness.\n\nWe more admire and value things that are unusual and strange than those\nof ordinary observation. I had not else so long insisted upon these\nexamples: for I believe whoever shall strictly observe what we\nordinarily see in those animals we have amongst us may there find as\nwonderful effects as those we seek in remote countries and ages. \u2018Tis\none and the same nature that rolls on her course, and whoever has\nsufficiently considered the present state of things, might certainly\nconclude as to both the future ana the past. I have formerly seen men,\nbrought hither by sea from very distant countries, whose language not\nbeing understood by us, and moreover their mien, countenance, and habit,\nbeing quite differing from ours; which of us did not repute them savages\nand brutes! Who did not attribute it to stupidity and want of common\nsense to see them mute, ignorant of the French tongue, ignorant of our\nsalutations and cringes, our port and behaviour, from which all human\nnature must by all means take its pattern and example. All that seems\nstrange to us, and that we do not understand, we condemn. The same\nthing happens also in the judgments we make of beasts. They have several\nconditions like to ours; from those we may, by comparison, draw some\nconjecture: but by those qualities that are particular to themselves,\nwhat know we what to make of them! The horses, dogs, oxen, sheep, birds,\nand most of the animals that live amongst us, know our voices, and\nsuffer themselves to be governed by them: so did Crassus\u2019s lamprey, and\ncame when he called it; as also do the eels that are found in the Lake\nArethusa; and I have seen several ponds where the fishes come to eat at\na certain call of those who use to feed them.\n\n\n      \u201cThey every one have names, and one and all\n   Straightway appear at their own master\u2019s call:\u201d\n\n\nWe may judge of that. We may also say that the elephants have some\nparticipation of religion forasmuch as after several washings and\npurifications they are observed to lift up their trunk like arms,\nand, fixing their eyes towards the rising of the sun, continue long in\nmeditation and contemplation, at certain hours of the days, of their\nown motion; without instruction or precept But because we do not see any\nsuch signs in other animals, we cannot for that conclude that they are\nwithout religion, nor make any judgment of what is concealed from us. As\nwe discern something in this action which the philosopher Cleanthes\ntook notice of, because it something resembles our own. He saw, he says,\n\u201cAnts go from their ant-hill, carrying the dead body of an ant towards\nanother ant-hill, whence several other ants came out to meet them, as if\nto speak with them; where, after having been a while together, the last\nreturned to consult, you may suppose, with their fellow-citizens, and so\nmade two or three journeys, by reason of the difficulty of capitulation.\nIn the conclusion, the last comers brought the first a worm out of their\nburrow, as it were for the ransom of the defunct, which the first laid\nupon their backs and carried home, leaving the dead body to the others.\u201d\n This was the interpretation that Cleanthes gave of this transaction,\ngiving us by that to understand that those creatures that have no voice\nare not, nevertheless, without intercourse and mutual communication,\nwhereof \u2018tis through our own defect that we do not participate; and for\nthat reason foolishly take upon us to pass our censure. But they yet\nproduce either effects far beyond our capacity, to which we are so far\nfrom being able to arrive by imitation that we cannot so much as by\nimitation conceive it. Many are of opinion that in the great and last\nnaval engagement that Antony lost to Augustus, his admiral galley was\nstayed in the middle of her course by the little fish the Latins call\n_remora_, by reason of the property she has of staying all sorts of\nvessels to which she fastens herself. And the Emperor Caligula, sailing\nwith a great navy upon the coast of Romania, his galley only was\nsuddenly stayed by the same fish, which, he caused to be taken, fastened\nas it was to the keel of his ship, very angry that such a little animal\ncould resist both the sea, the wind, and the force of all his oars, by\nbeing only fastened by the beak to his galley (for it is a shell-fish);\nand was moreover, not without great reason, astonished that, being\nbrought to him in the vessel, it had no longer the strength it had\nwithout. A citizen of Cyzicus formerly acquired the reputation of a good\nmathematician for having learnt the quality of the hedge-hog: he has his\nburrow open in divers places, and to several winds, and, foreseeing the\nwind that is to come, stops the hole on that side, which that citizen\nobserving, gave the city certain predictions of the wind which was\npresently to blow. The cam\u00e9l\u00e9on takes her colour from the place upon\nwhich she is laid; but the polypus gives himself what colour he pleases,\naccording to occasion, either to conceal himself from what he fears, or\nfrom what he has a design to seize: in the cam\u00e9l\u00e9on \u2018tis a passive, but\nin the polypus \u2018tis an active, change. We have some changes of\ncolour, as in fear, anger, shame, and other passions, that alter our\ncomplexions; but it is by the effect of suffering, as with the cam\u00e9l\u00e9on.\nIt is in the power of the jaundice, indeed, to make us turn yellow,\nbut \u2018tis not in the power of our own will. Now these effects that we\ndiscover in other animals, much greater than ours, seem to imply some\nmore excellent faculty in them unknown to us; as \u2018tis to be presumed\nthere are several other qualities and abilities of theirs, of which no\nappearances have arrived at us.\n\nAmongst all the predictions of elder times, the most ancient and the\nmost certain were those taken from the flight of birds; we have nothing\ncertain like it, nor any thing to be so much admired. That rule and\norder of the moving of the wing, whence they derived the consequences of\nfuture things, must of necessity be guided by some excellent means to\nso noble an operation: for to attribute this great effect to any natural\ndisposition, without the intelligence, consent, and meditation of him by\nwhom it is produced, is an opinion evidently false. That it is so, the\ncramp-fish has this quality, not only to benumb all the members that\ntouch her, but even through the nets transmit a heavy dulness into the\nhands of those that move and handle them; nay, it is further said that\nif one pour water upon her, he will feel this numbness mount up the\nwater to the hand, and stupefy the feeling through the water. This is a\nmiraculous force; but \u2018tis not useless to the cramp-fish; she knows it,\nand makes use on\u2019t; for, to catch the prey she desires, she will bury\nherself in the mud, that other fishes swimming over her, struck and\nbenumbed with this coldness of hers, may fall into her power. Cranes,\nswallows, and other birds of passage, by shifting their abode according\nto the seasons, sufficiently manifest the knowledge they have of their\ndivining faculty, and put it in use. Huntsmen assure us that to cull out\nfrom amongst a great many puppies that which ought to be preserved as\nthe best, the best way is to refer the choice to the mother; as thus,\ntake them and carry them out of the kennel, and the first she brings\nback will certainly be the best; or if you make a show as if you would\nenviron the kennel with fire, that one she first catches up to save. By\nwhich it appears they have a sort of prognostic which we have not; or\nthat they have some virtue in judging of their whelps other and more\ncertain than we have.\n\nThe manner of coming into the world, of engendering, nourishing, acting,\nmoving, living and dying of beasts, is so near to ours that whatever we\nretrench from their moving causes, and add to our own condition above\ntheirs, can by no means proceed from any meditation of our own reason.\nFor the regimen of our health, physicians propose to us the example of\nthe beasts\u2019 manners and way of living; for this saying (out of Plutarch)\nhas in all times been in the mouth of these people: \u201cKeep warm thy feet\nand head, as to the rest, live like a beast.\u201d\n\nThe chief of all natural actions is generation; we have a certain\ndisposition of members which is the most proper for us to that end;\nnevertheless, we are ordered by Lucretius to conform to the gesture and\nposture of the brutes as the most effectual:--\n\n\n      More ferarum,\n   Quadrupedumque magis ritu, plerumque putantur\n   Concipere uxores:\n   Quia sic loca sumere possunt,\n   Pectoribus positis, sublatis semina lumbis;\n\n\nand the same authority condemns, as hurtful, those indiscreet and\nimpudent motions which the women have added of their own invention, to\nwhom it proposes the more temperate and modest pattern and practice of\nthe beasts of their own sex:--\n\n\n      Nam mulier prohibet se concipere atque r\u00e9pugn\u00e2t,\n   Clunibus ipsa viri Venerem si l\u00e6ta retractet,\n   Atque exossato ciet omni pectore fluctua.\n   Ejicit enim sulci recta regione viaque\n   Vomerem, atque locis avertit seminis ictum.\n\n\nIf it be justice to render to every one their due, the beasts that\nserve, love, and defend their benefactors, and that pursue and fall upon\nstrangers and those who offend them, do in this represent a certain air\nof our justice; as also in observing a very equitable equality in the\ndistribution of what they have to their young. And as to friendship,\nthey have it without comparison more lively and constant than men have.\nKing Lysimachus\u2019s dog, Hyrcanus, master being dead, lay on his bed,\nobstinately refusing either to eat or drink; and, the day that his\nbody was burnt, he took a run and leaped into the fire, where he was\nconsumed, As also did the dog of one Pyrrhus, for he would not stir from\noff his master\u2019s bed from the time he died; and when they carried him\naway let himself be carried with him, and at last leaped into the pile\nwhere they burnt his master\u2019s body. There are inclinations of affection\nwhich sometimes spring in us, without the consultation of reason; and by\na fortuitous temerity, which others call sympathy; of which beasts\nare as capable as we. We see horses take such an acquaintance with\none another that we have much ado to make them eat or travel, when\nseparated; we observe them to fancy a particular colour in those of\ntheir own kind, and, where they meet it, run to it with great joy and\ndemonstrations of good will, and have a dislike and hatred for some\nother colour. Animals have choice, as well as we, in their amours, and\ncull out their mistresses; neither are they exempt from our jealousies\nand implacable malice.\n\nDesires are either natural and necessary, as to eat and drink; or\nnatural and not necessary, as the coupling with females; or neither\nnatural nor necessary; of which last sort are almost all the desires of\nmen; they are all superfluous and artificial. For \u2018tis marvellous how\nlittle will satisfy nature, how little she has left us to desire; our\nragouts and kickshaws are not of her ordering. The Stoics say that a man\nmay live on an olive a day. The delicacy of our wines is no part of her\ninstruction, nor the refinements we introduce into the indulgence of our\namorous appetites:--\n\n\n      Neque ilia\n   Magno prognatum deposcit consule cunnum.\n\n      \u201cNature, in her pursuit of love, disclaims\n   The pride of titles, and the pomp of names.\u201d\n\n\nThese irregular desires, that the ignorance of good and a false opinion\nhave infused into us, are so many that they almost exclude all the\nnatural; just as if there were so great a number of strangers in the\ncity as to thrust out the natural inhabitants, or, usurping upon their\nancient rights and privileges, should extinguish their authority and\nintroduce new laws and customs of their own. Animals are much more\nregular than we, and keep themselves with greater moderation within the\nlimits nature has prescribed; but yet not so exactly that they have not\nsometimes an analogy with our debauches. And as there have been furious\ndesires that have impelled men to the love of beasts, so there have been\nexamples of beasts that have fallen in love with us, and been seized\nwith monstrous affection betwixt kinds; witness the elephant who was\nrival to Aristophanes the grammarian in the love of a young herb-wench\nin the city of Alexandria, who was nothing behind him in all the offices\nof a very passionate suitor; for going through the market where they\nsold fruit, he would take some in his trunk and carry them to her.\nHe would as much as possible keep her always in his sight, and would\nsometimes put his trunk under her handkerchief into her bosom, to feel\nher breasts. They tell also of a dragon in love with a girl, and of a\ngoose enamoured of a child; of a ram that was suitor to the minstrelless\nGlaucia, in the town of Asopus; and we see not unfrequently baboons\nfuriously in love with women. We see also certain male animals that\nare fond of the males of their own kind. Oppian and others give us some\nexamples of the reverence that beasts have to their kindred in their\ncopulations; but experience often shows us the contrary:--\n\n\n      Nec habetur turpe juvenc\u00e6\n   Ferre patrem tergo; fit equo sua filia conjux;\n   Quasque creavit, init pecudes caper; ipsaque cujus\n   Semine concepta est, ex illo concipit ales.\n\n      \u201cThe heifer thinks it not a shame to take\n   Her lusty sire upon her willing back:\n   The horse his daughter leaps, goats scruple not\n   T\u2019 increase the herd by those they have begot;\n   And birds of all sorts do in common live,\n   And by the seed they have conceived conceive.\u201d\n\n\nAnd for subtle cunning, can there be a more pregnant example than in the\nphilosopher Thales\u2019s mule? who, fording a river, laden with salt, and\nby accident stumbling there, so that the sacks he carried were all wet,\nperceiving that by the melting of the salt his burden was something\nlighter, he never failed, so oft as he came to any river, to lie down\nwith his load; till his master, discovering the knavery, ordered that he\nshould be laden with wood? wherein, finding himself mistaken, he ceased\nto practise that device. There are several that very vividly represent\nthe true image of our avarice; for we see them infinitely solicitus to\nget all they can, and hide it with that exceeding great care, though\nthey never make any use of it at all. As to thrift, they surpass us not\nonly in the foresight and laying up, and saving for the time to come,\nbut they have, moreover, a great deal of the science necessary thereto.\nThe ants bring abroad into the sun their grain and seed to air, refresh\nand dry them when they perceive them to mould and grow musty, lest they\nshould decay and rot. But the caution and prevention they use in gnawing\ntheir grains of wheat surpass all imagination of human prudence; for by\nreason that the wheat does not always continue sound and dry, but grows\nsoft, thaws and dissolves as if it were steeped in milk, whilst hasting\nto germination; for fear lest it should shoot and lose the nature and\nproperty of a magazine for their subsistence, they nibble off the end by\nwhich it should shoot and sprout.\n\nAs to what concerns war, which is the greatest and most magnificent of\nhuman actions, I would very fain know whether we would use it for an\nargument of some prerogative or, on contrary, for a testimony of our\nweakness and imperfection; as, in truth, the science of undoing and\nkilling one another, and of ruining and destroying our own kind, has\nnothing in it so tempting as to make it be coveted by beasts who have it\nnot.\n\n\n      Quando leoni Fortior eripuit vitam leo? quo nemore unquam\n   Expiravit aper majoris dentibus apri?\n\n      \u201cNo lion drinks a weaker lion\u2019s gore,\n   No boar expires beneath a stronger boar.\u201d\n\n\nYet are they not universally exempt; witness the furious encounters of\nbees, and the enterprises of the princes of the contrary armies:--\n\n\n      S\u00e6pe duobus Regibus incessit magno discordia motu;\n   Continuoque animos vulgi et trepidantia bello\n   Gorda licet long\u00e9 pr\u00e6sciscere.\n\n      \u201cBut if contending factions arm the hive,\n   When rival kings in doubtful battle strive,\n   Tumultuous crowds the dread event prepare,\n   And palpitating hearts that beat to war.\u201d\n\n\nI never read this divine description but that, methinks, I there see\nhuman folly and vanity represented in their true and lively colours. For\nthese warlike movements, that so ravish us with their astounding noise\nand horror, this rattle of guns, drums, and cries,\n\n\n      Fulgur ibi ad coelum se tollit, totaque circum\n   \u00c6re renidescit tellus, subterque vir\u00fbm vi\n   Excitur pedibus sonitus, clamoreque montes\n   Icti rejectant voces ad sidera mundi;\n\n      \u201cWhen burnish\u2019d arms to heaven dart their rays,\n   And many a steely beam i\u2019 th\u2019 sunlight plays,\n   When trampled is the earth by horse and man,\n   Until the very centre groans again,\n   And that the rocks, struck by the various cries,\n   Reverberate the sound unto the skies;\u201d\n\n\nin the dreadful embattling of so many thousands of armed men, and so\ngreat fury, ardour, and courage, \u2018tis pleasant to consider by what idle\noccasions they are excited, and by how light ones appeased:--\n\n\n      Paridis propter narratur amorem\n   Greci\u00e6 Barbari\u00e6 diro collisa duello:\n\n      \u201cOf wanton Paris the illicit love\n   Did Greece and Troy to ten years\u2019 warfare move:\u201d\n\n\nall Asia was ruined and destroyed for the lust of Paris; the envy of\none single man, a despite, a pleasure, a domestic jealousy, causes that\nought not to set two oyster-wenches by the ears, is the mover of all\nthis mighty bustle. Shall we believe those very men who are themselves\nthe principal authors of these mischiefs? Let us then hear the greatest,\nthe most powerful, the most victorious emperor that ever was, turning\ninto a jest, very pleasantly and ingeniously, several battles fought\nboth by sea and land, the blood and lives of five hundred thousand men\nthat followed his fortune, and the strength and riches of two parts of\nthe world drained for the expense of his expeditions:--\n\n\n      Quod futuit Glaphyran Antonius, hanc mihi poenam\n   Fulvia constituit, se quoqne uti futuam.\n   Fulviam ego ut futuam! quid, si me Manius oret\n   Podicem, faciam?

Allons, sonnes trompettes.\n\n       \u2018Cause Anthony is fired with Glaphire\u2019s charms\n   Fain would his Fulvia tempt me to her arms.\n   If Anthony be false, what then? must I\n   Be slave to Fulvia\u2019s lustful tyranny?\n   Then would a thousand wanton, waspish wives,\n\n\n(I use my Latin with the liberty of conscience you are pleased to allow\nme.) Now this great body, with so many fronts, and so many motions,\nwhich seems to threaten heaven and earth:--\n\n\n      Quam multi Lybico volvuntur marmore fluctus,\n   S\u00e6vus ubi Orion hibemis conditur undis,\n   Vel quam solo novo dens\u00e6 torrentur Arist\u00e6,\n   Aut Hermi campo, aut Lyci\u00e6 flaventibus arvis;\n   Scuta sonant, pulsuque pedum tremit excita tellus:\n\n      \u201cNot thicker billows beat the Lybian main,\n   When pale Orion sits in wintry rain;\n   Nor thicker harvests on rich Hermus rise,\n   Or Lycian fields, when Phobus burns the skies,\n   Than stand these troops: their bucklers ring around;\n   Their trampling turns the turf and shakes the solid ground:\u201d\n\n\nthis furious monster, with so many heads and arms, is yet man--feeble,\ncalamitous, and miserable man! \u2018Tis but an ant-hill disturbed and\nprovoked:--\n\n\n   It nigrum campis agmen:\n\n   \u201cThe black troop marches to the field:\u201d\n\n\na contrary blast, the croaking of a flight of ravens, the stumble of\na horse, the casual passage of an eagle, a dream, a voice, a sign, a\nmorning mist, are any one of them sufficient to beat down and overturn\nhim. Dart but a sunbeam in his face, he is melted and vanished. Blow\nbut a little dust in his eyes, as our poet says of the bees, and all our\nensigns and legions, with the great Pompey himself at the head of them,\nare routed and crushed to pieces; for it was he, as I take it, that\nSertorious beat in Spain with those fine arms, which also served Eumenes\nagainst Antigonus, and Surena against Crassus:--\n\n\n      \u201cSwarm to my bed like bees into their hives.\n   Declare for love, or war, she said; and frown\u2019d:\n   No love I\u2019ll grant: to arms bid trumpets sound.\u201d\n\n\n      Hi motus animorum, atque hoc certamina tanta,\n   Pulveris exigui jactu compressa quiescent.\n\n      \u201cYet at thy will these dreadful conflicts cease,\n   Throw but a little dust and all is peace.\u201d\n\n\nLet us but slip our flies after them, and they will have the force and\ncourage to defeat them. Of fresh memory, the Portuguese having besieged\nthe city of Tamly, in the territory of Xiatine, the inhabitants of the\nplace brought a great many hives, of which are great plenty in that\nplace, upon the wall; and with fire drove the bees so furiously upon the\nenemy that they gave over the enterprise, not being able to stand their\nattacks and endure their stings; and so the citizens, by this new sort\nof relief, gained liberty and the victory with so wonderful a fortune,\nthat at the return of their defenders from the battle they found they\nhad not lost so much as one. The souls of emperors and cobblers are cast\nin the same mould; the weight and importance of the actions of princes\nconsidered, we persuade ourselves that they must be produced by some as\nweighty and important causes; but we are deceived; for they are pushed\non, and pulled back in their motions, by the same springs that we are\nin our little undertakings. The same reason that makes us wrangle with\na neighbour causes a war betwixt princes; the same reason that makes us\nwhip a lackey, falling into the hands of a king makes him ruin a whole\nprovince. They are as lightly moved as we, but they are able to do more.\nIn a gnat and an elephant the passion is the same.\n\nAs to fidelity, there is no animal in the world so treacherous as man.\nOur histories have recorded the violent pursuits that dogs have made\nafter the murderers of their masters. King Pyrrhus observing a dog that\nwatched a dead man\u2019s body, and understanding that he had for three\ndays together performed that office, commanded that the body should be\nburied, and took the dog along with him. One day, as he was at a general\nmuster of his army, this dog, seeing his master\u2019s murderers, with great\nbarking and extreme signs of anger flew upon them, and by this first\naccusation awakened the revenge of this murder, which was soon after\nperfected by form of justice. As much was done by the dog of the wise\nHesiod, who convicted the sons of Ganictor of Naupactus of the murder\ncommitted on the person of his master. Another dog being to guard a\ntemple at Athens, having spied a sacrilegious thief carrying away\nthe finest jewels, fell to barking at him with all his force, but the\nwarders not awaking at the noise, he followed him, and day being broke,\nkept off at a little distance, without losing sight of him; if he\noffered him any thing to eat he would not take it, but would wag his\ntail at all the passengers he met, and took whatever they gave him; and\nif the thief laid down to sleep, he likewise stayed upon the same place.\nThe news of this dog being come to the warders of the temple they put\nthemselves upon the pursuit, inquiring of the colour of the dog, and\nat last found him in the city of Cromyon, and the thief also, whom they\nbrought back to Athens, where he got his reward; and the judges, in\nconsideration of this good office, ordered a certain measure of corn\nfor the dog\u2019s daily sustenance, at the public charge, and the priests to\ntake care of it. Plutarch delivers this story for a certain truth, and\nthat it happened in the age wherein he lived.\n\nAs to gratitude (for I think we need bring this word into a little\nrepute), this one example, which Apion reports himself to have been an\neye-witness of, shall suffice.\n\n\u201cOne day,\u201d says he, \u201cat Rome, they entertained the people with the sight\nof the fighting of several strange beasts, and principally of lions\nof an unusual size; there was one amongst the rest who, by his furious\ndeportment, by the strength and largeness of his limbs, and by his loud\nand dreadful roaring, attracted the eyes of all the spectators. Amongst\nother slaves that were presented to the people in this combat of beasts\nthere was one Androdus, of Dacia, belonging to a Roman lord of consular\ndignity. This lion having seen him at a distance first made a sudden\nstop, as it were in a wondering posture, and then softly approached\nnearer in a gentle and peaceable manner, as if it were to enter into\nacquaintance with him. This being done, and being now assured of what he\nsought for, he began to wag his tail, as dogs do when they flatter their\nmasters, and to kiss and lick the hands and thighs of the poor wretch,\nwho was beside himself, and almost dead with fear. Androdus being by\nthis kindness of the lion a little come to himself, and having taken so\nmuch heart as to consider and know him, it was a singular pleasure to\nsee the joy and caresses that passed betwixt them. At which the people\nbreaking into loud acclamations of joy, the emperor caused the slave\nto be called, to know from him the cause of so strange an event; who\nthereupon told him a new and a very strange story: \u201cMy master,\u201d said\nhe, \u201cbeing pro-consul in Africa, I was constrained, by his severity and\ncruel usage, being daily beaten, to steal from him and run away; and,\nto hide myself secretly from a person of so great authority in the\nprovince, I thought it my best way to fly to the solitudes, sands, and\nuninhabitable parts of that country, resolving that in case the means of\nsupporting life should chance to fail me, to make some shift or other\nto kill myself. The sun being excessively hot at noon, and the heat\nintolerable, I lit upon a private and almost inaccessible cave, and went\ninto it Soon after there came in to me this lion, with one foot wounded\nand bloody, complaining and groaning with the pain he endured. At his\ncoming I was exceeding afraid; but he having spied me hid in the comer\nof his den, came gently to me, holding out and showing me his wounded\nfoot, as if he demanded my assistance in his distress. I then drew out\na great splinter he had got there, and, growing a little more familiar\nwith him, squeezing the wound thrust out the matter, dirt, and gravel\nwhich was got into it, and wiped and cleansed it the best I could. He,\nfinding himself something better, and much eased of his pain, laid him\ndown to rest, and presently fell asleep with his foot in my hand. From\nthat time forward he and I lived together in this cave three whole years\nupon one and the same diet; for of the beasts that he killed in hunting\nhe always brought me the best pieces, which I roasted in the sun for\nwant of fire, and so ate it. At last, growing weary of this wild\nand brutish life, the lion being one day gone abroad to hunt for our\nordinary provision, I departed thence, and the third day after was taken\nby the soldiers, who brought me from Africa to this city to my master,\nwho presently condemned me to die, and to be thus exposed to the wild\nbeasts. Now, by what I see, this lion was also taken soon after, who has\nnow sought to recompense me for the benefit and cure that he received\nat my hands.\u201d This is the story that Androdus told the emperor, which he\nalso conveyed from hand to hand to the people; wherefore, at the general\nrequest, he was absolved from his sentence and set at liberty, and the\nlion was, by order of the people, presented to him. \u201cWe afterwards saw,\u201d\n says Apion, \u201cAndrodus leading this lion, in nothing but a small leash,\nfrom tavern to tavern at Rome, and receiving what money every body would\ngive him, the lion being so gentle as to suffer himself to be covered\nwith the flowers that the people threw upon him, every one that met him\nsaying, \u2018There goes the lion that entertained the man; there goes the\nman that cured the lion.\u2019\u201d\n\nWe often lament the loss of beasts we love, and so do they the loss of\nus:--\n\n\n      Post, bellator equus, positis insignibus, \u00c6thon\n   It lacrymans, guttisque humect\u00e2t grandibus ora.\n\n      \u201cTo close the pomp, \u00c6thon, the steed of state.\n   Is led, the fun\u2019ral of his lord to wait.\n   Stripped of his trappings, with a sullen pace\n   He walks, and the big tears run rolling down his face.\u201d\n\n\nAs some nations have their wives in common, and some others have every\none his own, is not the same seen among beasts, and marriages better\nkept than ours? As to the society and confederation they make\namongst themselves, to league together and to give one another mutual\nassistance, is it not known that oxen, hogs, and other animals, at the\ncry of any of their kind that we offend, all the herd run to his aid\nand embody for his defence? The fish Scarus, when he has swallowed the\nangler\u2019s hook, his fellows all crowd about him and gnaw the line in\npieces; and if, by chance, one be got into the bow net, the others\npresent him their tails on the outside, which he holding fast with his\nteeth, they after that manner disengage and draw him out.\n\nMullets, when one of their companions is engaged, cross the line over\ntheir back, and, with a fin they have there, indented like a saw, cut\nand saw it asunder. As to the particular offices that we receive from\none another for the service of life, there are several like examples\namongst them. \u2018Tis said that the whale never moves that she has not\nalways before her a little fish like the sea-gudgeon, for this reason\ncalled the guide-fish, whom the whale follows, suffering himself to be\nled and turned with as great facility as the rudder guides the ship; in\nrecompense of which service also, whereas all the other things, whether\nbeast or vessel, that enter into the dreadful gulf of this monster\u2019s\nmouth, are immediately lost and swallowed up, this little fish retires\ninto it in great security, and there sleeps, during which time the whale\nnever stirs; but so soon as ever it goes out he immediately follows\nit; and if by accident he loses the sight of his little guide, he goes\nwandering here and there, and strikes his sides against the rocks like a\nship that has lost her helm; which Plutarch affirms to have seen in\nthe island of Anticyra. There is a like society betwixt the little bird\ncalled the wren and the crocodile. The wren serves for a sentinel over\nthis great animal; and if the ichneumon, his mortal enemy, approach\nto fight him, this little bird, for fear lest he should surprise him\nasleep, both with his voice and bill rouses him and gives him notice\nof his danger. He feeds of this monster\u2019s leavings, who receives him\nfamiliarly into his mouth, suffering him to peck in his jaws and betwixt\nhis teeth, and thence to pick out the bits of flesh that remain; and\nwhen he has a mind to shut his mouth, he first gives the bird warning to\ngo out by closing it by little and little, and without bruising or doing\nit any harm at all. The shell-fish called the naker, lives in the same\nintelligence with the shrimp, a little sort of animal of the lobster\nkind, which serves him in the nature of a porter, sitting at the opening\nof the shell, which the naker keeps always gaping and open till the\nshrimp sees some little fish, proper for their prey, within the hollow\nof the shell, where she enters too, and pinches the naker so to the\nquick that she is forced to close her shell, where they two together\ndevour the prey they have trapped in their fort. In the manner of living\nof the tunnies we observe a singular knowledge of the three parts of\nmathematics. As to astrology, they teach it men, for they stay in the\nplace where they are surprised by the brumal solstice, and never\nstir thence till the next equinox; for which reason Aristotle himself\nattributes to them this science. As to geometry and arithmetic, they\nalways form their numbers in the figure of a cube, every way square, and\nmake up the body of a battalion, solid, close, and environed round\nwith six equal sides, and swim in this square order, as large behind\nas before; so that whoever in seeing them can count one rank may\neasily number the whole troop, by reason that the depth is equal to the\nbreadth, and the breadth to the length.\n\nAs to magnanimity, it will be hard to exhibit a better instance of it\nthan in the example of the great dog sent to Alexander the Great from\nthe Indies. They first brought him a stag to encounter, next a boar, and\nafter that a bear, all which he slighted, and disdained to stir from\nhis place; but when he saw a lion he then immediately roused himself,\nevidently manifesting that he declared that alone worthy to enter the\nlists with him. Touching repentance and the acknowledgment of faults,\n\u2018tis reported of an elephant that, having in the impetuosity of his rage\nkilled his keeper, he fell into so extreme a sorrow that he would never\nafter eat, but starved himself to death. And as to clemency, \u2018tis said\nof a tiger, the most cruel of all beasts, that a kid having been put\nin to him, he suffered a two days\u2019 hunger rather than hurt it, and the\nthird broke the grate he was shut up in, to seek elsewhere for prey; so\nunwilling he was to fall upon the kid, his familiar and his guest, And\nas to the laws of familiarity and agreement, formed by conversation,\nit ordinarily happens that we bring up cats, dogs, and hares, tame\ntogether.\n\nBut that which seamen by experience know, and particularly in the\nSicilian Sea, of the quality of the halcyons, surpasses all human\nthought of what kind of animal has nature even so much honoured the\nbirth? The poets indeed say that one only island, Delos, which was\nbefore a floating island, was fixed for the service of Latona\u2019s\nlying-in; but God has ordered that the whole ocean should be stayed,\nmade stable and smooth, without waves, without winds or rain, whilst\nthe halcyon produces her young, which is just about the solstice, the\nshortest day of the year; so that by her privilege we have seven days\nand seven nights in the very heart of winter wherein we may sail without\ndanger. Their females never have to do with any other male but their\nown, whom they serve and assist all their lives, without ever forsaking\nhim. If he becomes weak and broken with age, they take him upon their\nshoulders and carry him from place to place, and serve him till death.\nBut the most inquisitive into the secrets of nature could never yet\narrive at the knowledge of the wonderful fabric wherewith the halcyon\nbuilds her nest for her little ones, nor guess at the materials.\nPlutarch, who has seen and handled many of them, thinks it is the bones\nof some fish which she joins and binds together, interlacing them, some\nlengthwise and others across, and adding ribs and hoops in such manner\nthat she forms at last a round vessel fit to launch; which being done,\nand the building finished, she carries it to the beach, where the sea\nbeating gently against it shows where she is to mend what is not well\njointed and knit, and where better to fortify the seams that are leaky,\nthat open at the beating of the waves; and, on the contrary, what is\nwell built and has had the due finishing, the beating of the waves does\nso close and bind together that it is not to be broken or cracked by\nblows either of stone or iron without very much ado. And that which is\nmore to be admired is the proportion and figure of the cavity within,\nwhich is composed and proportioned after such a manner as not to receive\nor admit any other thing than the bird that built it; for to any thing\nelse it is so impenetrable, close, and shut, nothing can enter, not so\nmuch as the water of the sea. This is a very dear description of this\nbuilding, and borrowed from a very good hand; and yet me-thinks it does\nnot give us sufficient light into the difficulty of this architecture.\nNow from what vanity can it proceed to despise and look down upon,\nand disdainfully to interpret, effects that we can neither imitate nor\ncomprehend?\n\nTo pursue a little further this equality and correspondence betwixt us\nand beasts, the privilege our soul so much glorifies herself upon, of\nthings she conceives to her own law, of striping all things that come\nto her of their mortal and corporeal qualities, of ordering and\nplacing things she conceives worthy her taking notice of, stripping and\ndivesting them of their corruptible qualities, and making them to\nlay aside length, breadth, depth, weight, colour, smell, roughness,\nsmoothness, hardness, softness, and all sensible accidents, as mean\nand superfluous vestments, to accommodate them to her own immortal and\nspiritual condition; as Rome and Paris, for example, that I have in\nmy fancy, Paris that I imagine, I imagine and comprehend it without\ngreatness and without place, without stone, without plaster, and without\nwood; this very same privilege, I say, seems evidently to be in beasts;\nfor a courser accustomed to trumpets, to musket-shots, and battles, whom\nwe see start and tremble in his sleep and stretched upon his litter,\nas if he were in a fight; it is almost certain that he conceives in\nhis soul the beat of a drum without noise, and an army without arms and\nwithout body:--\n\n\n      Quippe videbis equos fortes, cum membra jacebunt\n   In somnis, sudare tamen, spirareque s\u00e6pe,\n   Et quasi de palm\u00e2 summas contendere vires:\n\n      \u201cYou shall see maneg\u2019d horses in their sleep\n   Sweat, snort, start, tremble, and a clutter keep,\n   As if with all their force they striving were\n   The victor\u2019s palm proudly away to bear:\u201d\n\n\nthe hare, that a greyhound imagines in his sleep, after which we see\nhim pant so whilst he sleeps, stretch out his tail, shake his legs, and\nperfectly represents all the motions of a course, is a hare without fur\nand without bones:--\n\n\n      Venantumque canes in molli s\u00e6pe quiete\n   Jactant crura tamen subito, vocesque repente\n   Mittunt, et crebras reducunt naribus auras,\n   Ut vestigia si teneant inventa ferarum:\n   Expergef\u00e6tique sequuntur inania s\u00e6pe\n   Cervorum simulacra, fag\u00e6 quasi dedita cernant;\n   Donee discussis redeant erroribus ad se:\n\n      \u201cAnd hounds stir often in their quiet rest,\n   Spending their mouths, as if upon a quest,\n   Snuff, and breathe quick and short, as if they went\n   In a full chase upon a burning scent:\n   Nay, being wak\u2019d, imagin\u2019d stags pursue,\n   As if they had them in their real view,\n   Till, having shook themselves more broad awake,\n   They do at last discover the mistake:\u201d\n\n\nthe watch-dogs, that we often observe to snarl in their dreams, and\nafterwards bark out, and start up as if they perceived some stranger\nat hand; the stranger that their soul discerns is a man spiritual and\nimperceptible, without dimension, without colour, and without being:--\n\n\n      Consueta domi catulorum blanda propago\n   Degere, s\u00e6pe levem ex oculis volucremque soporem\n   Discutere, et corpus de terra corripere instant,\n   Proinde quasi ignotas facies atque ora tuantur.\n\n      \u201cThe fawning whelps of household curs will rise,\n   And, shaking the soft slumber from their eyes,\n   Oft bark and stare at ev\u2019ry one within,\n   As upon faces they had never seen.\u201d\n\n\nto the beauty of the body, before I proceed any further I should know\nwhether or no we are agreed about the description. \u2018Tis likely we do\nnot well know what beauty is in nature and in general, since to our\nown human beauty we give so many divers forms, of which, were there any\nnatural rule and prescription, we should know it in common, as the heat\nof the fire. But we fancy the forms according to our own appetite and\nliking:--\n\n\n   Turpis Romano Belgicus ore color:\n\n   \u201cA German hue ill suits, a Roman face.\u201d\n\n\nThe Indians paint it black and tawny, with great swelled lips, wide flat\nnoses and load the cartilage betwixt the nostrils with great rings of\ngold, to make it hang down to the mouth; as also the under lip with\ngreat hoops, enriched with precious stones, that weigh them down to fall\nupon the chin, it being with them a singular grace to show their teeth,\neven below the roots. In Peru the greatest ears are the most beautiful,\nwhich they stretch out as far as they can by art. And a man now living\nsays that he has seen in an eastern nation this care of enlarging them\nin so great repute, and the ear loaded with so ponderous jewels, that he\ndid with great ease put his arm, sleeve and all, through the hole of\nan ear. There are elsewhere nations that take great care to black their\nteeth, and hate to see them white, whilst others paint them red. The\nwomen are reputed more beautiful, not only in Biscay, but elsewhere,\nfor having their heads shaved; and, which is more, in certain frozen\ncountries, as Pliny reports. The Mexicans esteem a low forehead a great\nbeauty, and though they shave all other parts, they nourish hair on\nthe forehead and increase it by art, and have great breasts in so great\nreputation that they affect to give their children suck over their\nshoulders. We should paint deformity so. The Italians fashion it gross\nand massy; the Spaniards gaunt and slender; and amongst us one has\nit white, another brown; one soft and delicate, another strong and\nvigorous; one will have his mistress soft and gentle, others haughty and\nmajestic. Just as the preference in beauty that Plato attributes to the\nspherical figure the Epicureans gave rather to the pyramidal or square,\nand cannot swallow a god in the form of a bowl. But, be it how it will,\nnature has no more privileged us in this from her common laws than in\nthe rest And if we will judge ourselves aright, we shall find that, if\nthere be some animals less favoured in this than we, there are others,\nand in greater number, that are more; _a multis animalibus decore\nvincimur_ \u201cMany animals surpass us in beauty,\u201d even among the\nterrestrial, our compatriots; for as to those of sea, setting the figure\naside, which cannot fall into any manner of proportion, being so much\nanother thing in colour, clearness, smoothness, and arrangement, we\nsufficiently give place to them; and no less, in all qualities, to the\naerial. And this prerogative that the poets make such a mighty matter\nof, our erect stature, looking towards heaven our original,\n\n\n      Pronaque cum spectent animalia c\u00e6tera terrain,\n   Os homini sublime d\u00e9dit, columque tueri\n   Jussit, et erectos ad sidera tollere vultus,\n\n      \u201cWhilst all the brutal creatures downward bend\n   Their sight, and to their earthly mother tend,\n   He set man\u2019s face aloft, that, with his eyes\n   Uplifted, he might view the starry skies,\u201d\n\n\nis truly poetical; for there are several little beasts who have their\nsight absolutely turned towards heaven; and I find the gesture of camels\nand ostriches much higher raised and more erect than ours. What animals\nhave not their faces above and not before, and do not look opposite,\nas we do; and that do not in their natural posture discover as much of\nheaven and earth as man? And what qualities of our bodily constitution,\nin Plato and Cicero, may not indifferently serve a thousand sorts of\nbeasts? Those that most resemble us are the most despicable and deformed\nof all the herd; for those, as to outward appearance and form of visage,\nare baboons:--\n\n\n      Simia quam similis, turpissima bestia, nobis?\n\n      \u201cHow like to man, in visage and in shape,\n   Is, of all beasts the most uncouth, the ape?\u201d\n\n\nas to the internal and vital parts, the hog. In earnest, when I consider\nman stark naked, even in that sex which seems to have greatest share of\nbeauty, his defects, natural subjection, and imperfections, I find that\nwe have more reason than any other animal, to cover ourselves; and are\nto be excused from borrowing of those to whom nature has in this been\nkinder than to us, to trick ourselves out with their beauties, and hide\nourselves under their spoils, their wool, feathers, hair, and silk. Let\nus observe, as to the rest, that man is the sole animal whose nudities\noffend his own companions, and the only one who in his natural actions\nwithdraws and hides himself from his own kind. And really \u2018tis also\nan effect worth consideration, that they who are masters in the trade\nprescribe, as a remedy for amorous passions, the full and free view of\nthe body a man desires; for that to cool the ardour there needs no more\nbut freely and fully to see what he loves:--\n\n\n      Ille quod obsc\u00e6nas in aperto corpore partes\n   Viderat, in cursu qui fuit, h\u00e6sit amor.\n\n      \u201cThe love that\u2019s tilting when those parts appear\n   Open to view, flags in the hot career,\u201d\n\n\nAnd, although this receipt may peradventure proceed from a nice and cold\nhumour, it is notwithstanding a very great sign of our deficiencies\nthat use and acquaintance should make us disgust one another. It is\nnot modesty, so much as cunning and prudence, that makes our ladies so\ncircumspect to refuse us admittance into their cabinets before they are\npainted and tricked up for the public view:--\n\n\n      Nec Veneres nostras hoc fallit; quo magis ips\u00e6\n   Omnia summopere hos vit\u00e6 postscenia celant,\n   Quos retinere volunt, adstrictoque esse in amore:\n\n      \u201cOf this our ladies are full well aware,\n   Which make them, with such privacy and care,\n   Behind the scene all those defects remove,\n   Likely to check the flame of those they love,\u201d\n\n\nwhereas, in several animals there is nothing that we do not love, and\nthat does not please our senses; so that from their very excrements\nwe do not only extract wherewith to heighten our sauces, but also our\nrichest ornaments and perfumes. This discourse reflects upon none but\nthe ordinary sort of women, and is not so sacrilegious as to comprehend\nthose divine, supernatural, and extraordinary beauties, which we see\nshine occasionally among us like stars under a corporeal and terrestrial\nveil.\n\nAs to the rest, the very share that we allow to beasts of the bounty\nof nature, by our own confession, is very much to their advantage. We\nattribute to ourselves imaginary and fantastic good, future and absent\ngood, for which human capacity cannot of herself be responsible; or\ngood, that we falsely attribute to ourselves by the license of opinion,\nas reason, knowledge, and honour, and leave to them for their dividend,\nessential, durable, and palpable good, as peace, repose, security,\ninnocence, and health; health, I say, the fairest and richest present\nthat nature can make us. Insomuch that philosophy, even the Stoic, is so\nbold as to say, \u201cThat Heraclitus and Pherecides, could they have trucked\ntheir wisdom for health, and have delivered themselves, the one of his\ndropsy, and the other of the lousy disease that tormented him, they had\ndone well.\u201d By which they set a greater value upon wisdom, comparing and\nputting it into the balance with health, than they do with this other\nproposition, which is also theirs; they say that if Circe had presented\nUlysses with the two potions, the one to make a fool become a wise\nman, and the other to make a wise man become a fool, that Ulysses ought\nrather to have chosen the last, than consent to that by which Circe\nchanged his human figure into that of a beast; and say that wisdom\nitself would have spoke to him after this manner: \u201cForsake me, let me\nalone, rather than lodge me under the body and figure of an ass.\u201d How!\nthe philosophers, then will abandon this great and divine wisdom for\nthis corporeal and terrestrial covering? It is then no more by reason,\nby discourse, and by the soul, that we excel beasts; \u2018tis by our beauty,\nour fair complexion, and our fine symmetry of parts, for which we must\nquit our intelligence, our prudence, and all the rest. Well, I accept\nthis open and free confession; certainly they knew that those parts,\nupon which we so much value ourselves, are no other than vain fancy.\nIf beasts then had all the virtue, knowledge, wisdom, and stoical\nperfection, they would still be beasts, and would not be comparable to\nman, miserable, wicked, mad, man. For, in short, whatever is not as we\nare is nothing worth; and God, to procure himself an esteem among us,\nmust put himself into that shape, as we shall show anon. By which it\nappears that it is not upon any true ground of reason, but by a foolish\npride and vain opinion, that we prefer ourselves before other animals,\nand separate ourselves from their society and condition.\n\nBut to return to what I was upon before; we have for our part\ninconstancy, irresolution, incertitude, sorrow, superstition, solicitude\nof things to come, even after we shall be no more, ambition, avarice,\njealousy, envy, irregular, frantic, and untamed appetites, war, lying,\ndisloyalty, detraction, and curiosity. Doubtless, we have strangely\noverpaid this fine reason, upon which we so much glorify ourselves, and\nthis capacity of judging and knowing, if we have bought it at the price\nof this infinite number of passions to which we are eternally subject.\nUnless we shall also think fit, as even Socrates does, to add to the\ncounterpoise that notable prerogative above beasts, That whereas nature\nhas prescribed them certain seasons and limits for the delights of\nVenus, she has given us the reins at all hours and all seasons.\u201d _Ut\nvinum ogrotis, quia prodest rar\u00f4, nocet sopissime, melius est non\nadhibere omnino, quam, spe dubio salutis, in apertam per-niciem\nincurrere; sic, haud scio an melius fuerit humano generi motum istum\ncelerem cogitationis, acumen, solertiam, quam rationem vocamus, quoniam\npestifera sint multis, ad-modum paucis saluiaria, non dari omnino,\nquam tam muniice et tam large dari?_ As it falls out that wine often\nhurting the sick, and very rarely doing them good, it is better not to\ngive them any at all than to run into an apparent danger out of hope of\nan uncertain benefit, so I know not whether it had not been better for\nmankind that this quick motion, this penetration, this subtlety that we\ncall reason, had not been given to man at all; considering how pestiferous\nit is to many, and useful but to few, than to have been conferred in so\nabundant manner, and with so liberal a hand.\u201d Of what advantage can we\nconceive the knowledge of so many things was to Yarro and Aristotle? Did\nit exempt them from human inconveniences? Were they by it freed from\nthe accidents that lay heavy upon the shoulders of a porter? Did they\nextract from their logic any consolation for the gout? Or, for knowing\nhow this humour is lodged in the joints, did they feel it the less?\nDid they enter into composition with death by knowing that some nations\nrejoice at his approach; or with cuckoldry, by knowing that in some\nparts of the world wives are in common? On the contrary, having been\nreputed the greatest men for knowledge, the one amongst the Romans\nand the other amongst the Greeks, and in a time when learning did most\nflourish, we have not heard, nevertheless, that they had any particular\nexcellence in their lives; nay, the Greek had enough to do to clear\nhimself from some notable blemishes in his. Have we observed that\npleasure and health have a better relish with him that understands\nastrology and grammar than with others?\n\n\n   Illiterati num minus nervi rigent?\n\n   \u201cTh\u2019 illiterate ploughman is as fit\n   For Venus\u2019 service as the wit:\u201d\n\n\nor shame and poverty less troublesome to the first than to the last?\n\n\n      Scilicet et morbis et debilitate carebis,\n   Et luctum et curam effugies, et tempora vit\u00e6\n   Longa tibi post h\u00e6c fato meliore dabuntur.\n\n      \u201cDisease thy couch shall flee,\n   And sorrow and care; yes, thou, be sure, wilt see\n   Long years of happiness, till now unknown.\u201d\n\n\nI have known in my time a hundred artisans, a hundred labourers, wiser\nand more happy than the rectors of the university, and whom I had much\nrather have resembled. Learning, methinks, has its place amongst the\nnecessary, things of life, as glory, nobility, dignity, or at the most,\nas beauty, riches, and such other qualities, which indeed are useful\nto it, but remotely, and more by opinion than by nature. We stand\nvery little more in need of offices, rules, and laws of living in our\nsociety, than cranes and ants do in theirs; and yet we see that these\ncarry themselves very regularly without erudition. If man was wise, he\nwould take the true value of every thing according as it was useful\nand proper to his life. Whoever will number us by our actions and\ndeportments will find many more excellent men amongst the ignorant than\namong the learned; aye, in all sorts of virtue. Old Rome seems to me\nto have been of much greater value, both for peace and war, than that\nlearned Rome that ruined itself. And, though all the rest should be\nequal, yet integrity and innocency would remain to the ancients, for\nthey cohabit singularly well with simplicity. But I will leave this\ndiscourse, that would lead me farther than I am willing to follow; and\nshall only say this further, \u2018tis only humility and submission that can\nmake a complete good man. We are not to leave the knowledge of his duty\nto every man\u2019s own judgment; we are to prescribe it to him, and not\nsuffer him to choose it at his own discretion; otherwise, according to\nthe imbecility, and infinite variety of our reasons and opinions, we\nshould at large forge ourselves duties that would, as Epicurus says,\nenjoin us to eat one another.\n\nThe first law that ever God gave to man was a law of pure obedience; it\nwas a commandment naked and simple, wherein man had nothing to inquire\nafter, nor to dispute; forasmuch as to obey is the proper office of a\nrational soul, acknowledging a heavenly superior and benefactor. From\nobedience and submission spring all other virtues, as all sin does from\nselfopinion. And, on the contrary, the first temptation that by the\ndevil was offered to human nature, its first poison insinuated itself\ninto us by the promise made us of knowledge and wisdom; _Eritis sicut\nDii, scientes bonum et malum._ \u201cYe shall be as gods, knowing good and\nevil.\u201d And the sirens, in Homer, to allure Ulysses, and draw him within\nthe danger of their snares, offered to give him knowledge. The plague of\nman is the opinion of wisdom; and for this reason it is that ignorance\nis so recommended to us, by our religion, as proper to faith and\nobedience; _Cavete ne quis vos decipiat per philosophiam et inanes\nseductiones, secundum elementa mundi._ \u201cTake heed, lest any man deceive\nyou by philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, and the\nrudiments of the world.\u201d There is in this a general consent amongst\nall sorts of philosophers, that the sovereign good consists in the\ntranquillity of the soul and body; but where shall we find it?\n\n\n      Ad summum, sapiens uno minor est Jove, dives,\n   Liber, honoratus, pulcher, rex deniqne regum;\n   Pr\u00e6cipue sanus, nisi cum pituita molesta est:\n\n      \u201cIn short, the wise is only less than Jove,\n   Rich, free, and handsome; nay, a king above\n   All earthly kings; with health supremely blest,\n   Excepting when a cold disturbs his rest!\u201d\n\n\nIt seems, in truth, that nature, for the consolation of our miserable\nand wretched state, has only given us presumption for our inheritance.\n\u2018Tis as Epictetus says, that man has nothing properly his own, but the\nuse of his opinion; we have nothing but wind and smoke for our portion.\nThe gods have health in essence, says philosophy, and sickness in\nintelligence. Man, on the contrary, possesses his goods by fancy, his\nills in essence. We have reason to magnify the power of our imagination;\nfor all our goods are only in dream. Hear this poor calamitous animal\nhuff! \u201cThere is nothing,\u201d says Cicero, \u201cso charming as the employment of\nletters; of letters, I say, by means whereof the infinity of things, the\nimmense grandeur of nature, the heavens even in this world, the earth,\nand the seas are discovered to us; \u2018tis they that have taught us\nreligion, moderation, and the grandeur of courage, and that have rescued\nour souls from darkness, to make her see all things, high, low, first,\nlast, and middling; \u2018tis they that furnish us wherewith to live happily\nand well, and conduct us to pass over our lives without displeasure, and\nwithout offence.\u201d Does not this man seem to speak of the condition of\nthe ever-living and almighty God? But as to effects, a thousand little\ncountrywomen have lived lives more equal, more sweet, and constant than\nhis.\n\n\n      Deus ille fuit, deus, inclyte Memmi,\n   Qui princeps vit\u00e6 rationem invenit earn, qu\u00e6\n   Nunc appellatur sapientia; quique per artem\n   Fluctibus \u00e8 tantis vitam, tantisque tenebris,\n   In tam tranquilla et tam clara luce locavit:\n\n      \u201cThat god, great Memmus, was a god no doubt\n   Who, prince of life, first found that reason out\n   Now wisdom called; and by his art, who did\n   That life in tempests tost, and darkness hid,\n   Place in so great a calm, and clear a light:\u201d\n\n\nhere are brave ranting words; but a very slight accident put this man\u2019s\nunderstanding in a worse condition than that of the meanest shepherd,\nnotwithstanding this instructing god, this divine wisdom. Of the same\nstamp and impudence is the promise of Democritus\u2019s book: \u201cI am going to\nspeak of all things;\u201d and that foolish title that Aristotle prefixes\nto one of his, order only afforded him a few lucid intervals which\nhe employed in composing his book, and at last made him kill\nhimself,--Eusebius\u2019s Chronicon.\n\nOf the Mortal Gods; and the judgment of Chrysippus, that \u201cDion was as\nvirtuous as God;\u201d and my Seneca himself says, that \u201cGod had given him\nlife; but that to live well was his own;\u201d conformably to this other: _In\nvirtute vere gloriamur; quod non contingeret, si id donum \u00e0 Deo, non \u00e0\nnobis haberemus:_ \u201cWe truly glory in our virtue; which would not be,\nif it was given us of God, and not by ourselves;\u201d this is also Seneca\u2019s\nsaying; \u201cthat the wise man hath fortitude equal with God, but that his\nis in spite of human frailty, wherein therefore he more than equals\nGod.\u201d There is nothing so ordinary as to meet with sallies of the like\ntemerity; there is none of us, who take so much offence to see himself\nequalled with God, as he does to see himself undervalued by being ranked\nwith other creatures; so much more are we jealous of our own interest\nthan that of our Creator.\n\nBut we must trample under foot this foolish vanity, and briskly and\nboldly shake the ridiculous foundation upon which these false opinions\nare founded. So long as man shall believe he has any means and power of\nhimself, he will never acknowledge what he owes to his Maker; his eggs\nshall always be chickens, as the saying is; we must therefore strip him\nto his shirt. Let us see some notable examples of the effects of his\nphilosophy: Posidonius being tormented with a disease so painful as made\nhim writhe his arms and gnash his teeth, thought he sufficiently scorned\nthe dolour, by crying out against it: \u201cThou mayst do thy worst, I will\nnot confess that thou art an evil.\u201d He was as sensible of the pain as\nmy footman, but he made a bravado of bridling his tongue, at least,\nand restraining it within the laws of his sect: _Re succumbere non\noportebat, verbis gloriantem._ \u201cIt did not become him, that spoke so\nbig, to confess his frailty when he came to the test.\u201d Arcesilas being\nill of the gout, and Car-neades, who had come to see him, going away\ntroubled at his condition, he called him back, and showing him his feet\nand breast: \u201cThere is nothing comes thence hither,\u201d said he. This has\nsomething a better grace, for he feels himself in pain, and would be\ndisengaged from it; but his heart, notwithstanding, is not conquered nor\nsubdued by it. The other stands more obstinately to his point, but, I\nfear, rather verbally than really. And Dionysius Heracleotes, afflicted\nwith a vehement smarting in his eyes, was reduced to quit these stoical\nresolutions. But even though knowledge should, in effect, do as they\nsay, and could blunt the point, and dull the edge, of the misfortunes\nthat attend us, what does she, more than what ignorance does more purely\nand evidently?--The philosopher Pyrrho, being at sea in very great\ndanger, by reason of a mighty storm, presented nothing to the imitation\nof those who were with him, in that extremity, but a hog they had on\nboard, that was fearless and unconcerned at the tempest. Philosophy,\nwhen she has said all she can, refers us at last to the example of a\ngladiator, wrestler, or muleteer, in which sort of people we commonly\nobserve much less apprehension of death, sense of pain, and other\ninconveniences, and more of endurance, than ever knowledge furnished\nany one withal, that was not bom and bred to hardship. What is the cause\nthat we make incisions, and cut the tender limbs of an infant, and those\nof a horse, more easily than our own--but ignorance only? How many has\nmere force of imagination made sick? We often see men cause themselves\nto be let blood, purged, and physicked, to be cured of diseases they\nonly feel in opinion.--When real infirmities fail us, knowledge lends us\nher\u2019s; that colour, that complexion, portend some catarrhous defluxion;\nthis hot season threatens us with a fever; this breach in the\nlife-line of your left hand gives you notice of some near and dangerous\nindisposition; and at last she roundly attacks health itself; saying,\nthis sprightliness and vigour of youth cannot continue in this posture;\nthere must be blood taken, and the heat abated, lest it turn against\nyourself. Compare the life of a man subjected to such imaginations,\nto that of a labourer that suffers himself to be led by his natural\nappetite, measuring things only by the present sense, without knowledge,\nand without prognostic, that feels no pain or sickness, but when he is\nreally ill. Whereas the other has the stone in his soul, before he has\nit in his bladder; as if it were not time enough to suffer the evil when\nit shall come, he must anticipate it by fancy, and run to meet it.\n\nWhat I say of physic may generally serve in example for all other\nsciences. Thence is derived that ancient opinion of the philosophers\nthat placed the sovereign good in the discovery of the weakness of our\njudgment My ignorance affords me as much occasion of hope as of fear;\nand having no other rule for my health than that of the examples of\nothers, and of events I see elsewhere upon the like occasion, I find of\nall sorts, and rely upon those which by comparison are most favourable\nto me. I receive health with open arms, free, full, and entire, and\nby so much the more whet my appetite to enjoy it, by how much it is\nat present less ordinary and more rare; so far am I from troubling its\nrepose and sweetness with the bitterness of a new and constrained manner\nof living. Beasts sufficiently show us how much the agitation of our\nminds brings infirmities and diseases upon us. That which is told us of\nthose of Brazil, that they never die but of old age, is attributed to\nthe serenity and tranquillity of the air they live in; but I rather\nattribute it to the serenity and tranquillity of their souls, free from\nall passion, thought, or employment, extended or unpleasing, a people\nthat pass over their lives in a wonderful simplicity and ignorance,\nwithout letters, without law, without king, or any manner of religion.\nAnd whence comes that, which we find by experience, that the heaviest\nand dullest men are most able; and the most to be desired in amorous\nperformances; and that the love of a muleteer often renders itself more\nacceptable than that of a gentleman, if it be not that the agitation\nof the soul in the latter disturbs his physical ability, dissolves and\ntires it, as it also ordinarily troubles and tires itself. What puts the\nsoul beside itself, and more usually throws it into madness, but her own\npromptness, vigour, and agility, and, finally, her own proper force? Of\nwhat is the most subtle folly made, but of the most subtle wisdom? As\ngreat friendships spring from great enmities, and vigorous health from\nmortal diseases, so from the rare and vivid agitations of our souls\nproceed the most wonderful and most distracted frenzies; \u2018tis but half\na turn of the toe from the one to the other. In the actions of madmen we\nsee how infinitely madness resembles the most vigorous operations of\nthe soul. Who does not know how indiscernible the difference is betwixt\nfolly and the sprightly elevations of a free soul, and the effects of a\nsupreme and extraordinary virtue? Plato says that melancholy persons are\nthe most capable of discipline, and the most excellent; and accordingly\nin none is there so great a propension to madness. Great wits are ruined\nby their own proper force and pliability; into what a condition, through\nhis own agitation and promptness of fancy, is one of the most judicious,\ningenious, and nearest formed, of any other Italian poet, to the air of\nthe ancient and true poesy, lately fallen! Has he not vast obligation\nto this vivacity that has destroyed him? to this light that has blinded\nhim? to this exact and subtle apprehension of reason that has put him\nbeside his own? to this curious and laborious search after sciences,\nthat has reduced him to imbecility? and to this rare aptitude to the\nexercises of the soul, that has rendered him without exercise and\nwithout soul? I was more angry, if possible, than compassionate, to see\nhim at Ferrara in so pitiful a condition surviving himself, forgetting\nboth himself and his works, which, without his knowledge, though before\nhis face, have been published unformed and incorrect.\n\nWould you have a man healthy, would you have him regular, and in a\nsteady and secure posture? Muffle him up in the shades of stupidity and\nsloth. We must be made beasts to be made wise, and hoodwinked before we\nare fit to be led. And if one shall tell me that the advantage of having\na cold and dull sense of pain and other evils, brings this disadvantage\nalong with it, to render us consequently less sensible also in the\nfruition of good and pleasure, this is true; but the misery of our\ncondition is such that we have not so much to enjoy as to avoid, and\nthat the extremest pleasure does not affect us to the degree that a\nlight grief does: _Segnius homines bona quam mala sentiunt._ We are not\nso sensible of the most perfect health as we are of the least sickness.\n\n\n      Pungit\n   In cute vix sum ma violatum plagula corpus;\n   Quando valere nihil quemquam movet. Hoc juvat unum,\n   Quod me non torquet latus, aut pes;\n   C\u00e6tera quisquam Vix queat aut sanum sese, aut sentire valentem.\n\n      \u201cThe body with a little sting is griev\u2019d,\n   When the most perfect health is not perceiv\u2019d,\n   This only pleases me, that spleen nor gout\n   Neither offend my side nor wring my foot;\n   Excepting these, scarce any one can tell,\n   Or e\u2019er observes, when he\u2019s in health and well.\u201d\n\n\nOur well-being is nothing but the not being ill. Which is the reason why\nthat sect of philosophers, which sets the greatest value upon pleasure,\nhas yet fixed it chiefly in unconsciousness of pain. To be freed from\nill is the greatest good that man can hope for or desire; as Ennius\nsays,--\n\n\n   Nimium boni est, cui nihil est mali;\n\n\nfor that every tickling and sting which are in certain pleasures, and\nthat seem to raise us above simple health and passiveness, that active,\nmoving, and, I know not how, itching, and biting pleasure; even that\nvery pleasure itself aims at nothing but insensibility as its mark. The\nappetite that carries us headlong to women\u2019s embraces has no other end\nbut only to cure the torment of our ardent and furious desires, and only\nrequires to be glutted and laid at rest, and delivered from the fever.\nAnd so of the rest. I say, then, that if simplicity conducts us to a\nstate free from evil, she leads us to a very happy one according to our\ncondition. And yet we are not to imagine it so stupid an insensibility\nas to be totally without sense; for Crantor had very good reason to\ncontrovert the insensibility of Epicurus, if founded so deep that the\nvery first attack and birth of evils were not to be perceived: \u201cI do not\napprove such an insensibility as is neither possible nor to be desired.\nI am very well content not to be sick; but if I am, I would know that\nI am so; and if a caustic be applied, or incisions made in any part, I\nwould feel them.\u201d In truth, whoever would take away the knowledge and\nsense of evil, would at the same time eradicate the sense of pleasure,\nand finally annihilate man himself: _Istud nihil dolere, non sine magn\u00e2\nmercede contingit, immanitatis in animo, stuporis in corpore._ \u201cAn\ninsensibility that is not to be purchased but at the price of inhumanity\nin the soul, and of stupidity of the body.\u201d Evil appertains to man\nof course. Neither is pain always to be avoided, nor pleasure always\npursued.\n\n\u2018Tis a great advantage to the honour of ignorance that knowledge itself\nthrows us into its arms, when she finds herself puzzled to fortify\nus against the weight of evil; she is constrained to come to this\ncomposition, to give us the reins, and permit us to fly into the lap\nof the other, and to shelter ourselves under her protection from the\nstrokes and injuries of fortune. For what else is her meaning when she\ninstructs us to divert our thoughts from the ills that press upon us,\nand entertain them with the meditation of pleasures past and gone; to\ncomfort ourselves in present afflictions with the remembrance of fled\ndelights, and to call to our succour a vanished satisfaction, to oppose\nit to the discomfort that lies heavy upon us? _Levationes \u00e6gritudinum\nin avocatione a cogitand\u00e2 molesti\u00e2, et revocation ad contemplandas\nvoluptates, ponit_; \u201cHe directs us to alleviate our grief and pains by\nrejecting unpleasant thoughts, and recalling agreeable ideas;\u201d if it be\nnot that where her power fails she would supply it with policy, and make\nuse of sleight of hand where force of limbs will not serve her turn? For\nnot only to a philosopher, but to any man in his right wits, when he has\nupon him the thirst of a burning fever, what satisfaction can it be to\nhim to remember the pleasure he took in drinking Greek wine a month ago?\nIt would rather only make matters worse to him:--\n\n\n   Che ricordarsi il ben doppia la noia.\n\n   \u201cThe thinking of pleasure doubles trouble.\u201d\n\n\nOf the same stamp is this other counsel that philosophy gives, only to\nremember the happiness that is past, and to forget the misadventures we\nhave undergone; as if we had the science of oblivion in our own power,\nand counsel, wherein we are yet no more to seek.\n\n\n   Suavis laborum est pr\u00e6teritorum r\u00e6moria.\n\n   \u201cSweet is the memory of by-gone pain.\u201d\n\n\nHow does philosophy, that should arm me to contend with fortune, and\nsteel my courage to trample all human adversities under foot, arrive to\nthis degree of cowardice to make me hide my head at this rate, and save\nmyself by these pitiful and ridiculous shifts? For the memory represents\nto us not what we choose, but what she pleases; nay, there is nothing\nthat so much imprints any thing in our memory as a desire to forget it.\nAnd \u2018tis a good way to retain and keep any thing safe in the soul to\nsolicit her to lose it. And this is false: _Est situm in nobis, ut\net adversa quasi perpetua oblivione obruamus, et secunda jucunde et\nsuaviter meminerimus;_ \u201cit is in our power to bury, as it were, in a\nperpetual oblivion, all adverse accidents, and to retain a pleasant and\ndelightful memory of our successes;\u201d and this is true: _Memini etiam quo\nnolo; oblivisci non possum quo volo._ \u201cI do also remember what I would\nnot; but I cannot forget what I would.\u201d And whose counsel is this? His,\n_qui se unies sapiervtem profiteri sit ausus;_ \u201cwho alone durst profess\nhimself a wise man.\u201d\n\n\n      Qui genus humanum ingenio superavit, et omnes\n   Pr\u00e6stinxit stellas, exortus uti \u00e6thereus Sol.\n\n      \u201cWho from mankind the prize of knowledge won,\n   And put the stars out like the rising sun.\u201d\n\n\nTo empty and disfurnish the memory, is not this the true way to\nignorance?\n\n\n   Iners malorum remedium ignorantia est.\n\n   \u201cIgnorance is but a dull remedy for evils.\u201d\n\n\nWe find several other like precepts, whereby we are permitted to borrow\nfrivolous appearances from the vulgar, where we find the strongest\nreason will not answer the purpose, provided they administer\nsatisfaction and comfort Where they cannot cure the wound, they are\ncontent to palliate and benumb it I believe they will not deny this,\nthat if they could add order and constancy in a state of life that could\nmaintain itself in ease and pleasure by some debility of judgment, they\nwould accept it:--\n\n\n      Potare, et spargere flores\n   Incipiam, patiarque vel inconsultus haberi.\n\n      \u201cGive me to drink, and, crown\u2019d with flowers, despise\n   The grave disgrace of being thought unwise.\u201d\n\n\nThere would be a great many philosophers of Lycas\u2019s mind this man, being\notherwise of very regular manners, living quietly and contentedly in his\nfamily, and not failing in any office of his duty, either towards his\nown or strangers, and very carefully preserving himself from hurtful\nthings, became, nevertheless, by some distemper in his brain, possessed\nwith a conceit that he was perpetually in the theatre, a spectator of\nthe finest sights and the best comedies in the world; and being cured by\nthe physicians of his frenzy, was hardly prevented from endeavouring by\nsuit to compel them to restore him again to his pleasing imagination:--\n\n\n      Pol I me occidistis, amici,\n   Non servastis, ait; cui sic extorta voluptas,\n   Et demptus per vim mentis gratissimus error;\n\n      \u201cBy heaven! you\u2019ve killed me, friends, outright,\n   And not preserved me; since my dear delight\n   And pleasing error, by my better sense\n   Unhappily return\u2019d, is banished hence;\u201d\n\n\nwith a madness like that of Thrasylaus the son of Pythodorus, who made\nhimself believe that all the ships that weighed anchor from the port of\nPir\u00e6us, and that came into the haven, only made their voyages for\nhis profit; congratulating them upon their successful navigation, and\nreceiving them with the greatest joy; and when his brother Crito caused\nhim to be restored to his better understanding, he infinitely regretted\nthat sort of condition wherein he had lived with so much delight and\nfree from all anxiety of mind. \u2018Tis according to the old Greek verse,\nthat \u201cthere is a great deal of convenience in not being over-wise.\u201d\n\nAnd Ecclesiastes, \u201cIn much wisdom there is much sorrow;\u201d and \u201cWho gets\nwisdom gets labour and trouble.\u201d\n\nEven that to which philosophy consents in general, that last remedy\nwhich she applies to all sorts of necessities, to put an end to the life\nwe are not able to endure. _Placet?--Pare. Non placet?--Qu\u00e2cumque vis,\nexi. Pungit dolor?--Vel fodiat sane. Si nudus es, da jugulum; sin tectus\narmis Vulcaniis, id est fortitudine, r\u00e9sist\u00e9;_ \u201cDoes it please?--Obey\nit. Not please?--Go where thou wilt. Does grief prick thee,--nay, stab\nthee?--If thou art naked, present thy throat; if covered with the arms\nof Vulcan, that is, fortitude, resist it.\u201d And this word, so used in\nthe Greek festivals, _aut bibat, aut abeat,_ \u201ceither drink or go,\u201d which\nsounds better upon the tongue of a Gascon, who naturally changes the h\ninto v, than on that of Cicero:--\n\n\n      Vivere si recte nescis, decede peritis.\n   Lusisti satis, edisti satis, atque bibisti;\n   Tempus abire tibi est, ne potum largius \u00e6quo\n   Rideat et pulset lasciva decentius \u00e6tas.\n\n      \u201cIf to live well and right thou dost not know,\n   Give way, and leave thy place to those that do.\n   Thou\u2019st eaten, drunk, and play\u2019d to thy content,\n   \u2018Tis time to make thy parting compliment,\n   Lest youth, more decent in their follies, scoff\n   The nauseous scene, and hiss thee reeling off;\u201d\n\n\nWhat is it other than a confession of his impotency, and a sending back\nnot only to ignorance, to be there in safety, but even to stupidity,\ninsensibility, and nonentity?\n\n\n      Democritum postquam matura vetustas\n   Admonuit memorem motus languescere mentis;\n   Sponte sua letho caput obvius obtulit ipse.\n\n      \u201cSoon as, through age, Democritus did find\n   A manifest decadence in his mind,\n   He thought he now surviv\u2019d to his own wrong,\n   And went to meet his death, that stay\u2019d too long.\u201d\n\n\n\u2018Tis what Antisthenes said, \u201cThat a man should either make provision\nof sense to understand, or of a halter to hang himself;\u201d and what\nChrysippus alleged upon this saying of the poet Tyrt\u00e6us:--\n\n\n   \u201cOr to arrive at virtue or at death;\u201d\n\n\nand Crates said, \u201cThat love would be cured by hunger, if not by time;\nand whoever disliked these two remedies, by a rope.\u201d That Sextius, of\nwhom both Seneca and Plutarch speak with so high an encomium, having\napplied himself, all other things set aside, to the study of philosophy,\nresolved to throw himself into the sea, seeing the progress of his\nstudies too tedious and slow. He ran to find death, since he could not\novertake knowledge. These are the words of the law upon the subject:\n\u201cIf peradventure some great inconvenience happen, for which there is no\nremedy, the haven is near, and a man may save himself by swimming out\nof his body as out of a leaky skiff; for \u2018tis the fear of dying, and not\nthe love of life, that ties the fool to his body.\u201d\n\nAs life renders itself by simplicity more pleasant, so more innocent\nand better, also it renders it as I was saying before: \u201cThe simple\nand ignorant,\u201d says St. Paul, \u201craise themselves up to heaven and take\npossession of it; and we, with all our knowledge, plunge ourselves into\nthe infernal abyss.\u201d I am neither swayed by Valentinian, a professed\nenemy to all learning and letters, nor by Licinius, both Roman emperors,\nwho called them the poison and pest of all political government; nor by\nMahomet, who, as \u2018tis said, interdicted all manner of learning to his\nfollowers; but the example of the great Lycurgus, and his authority,\nwith the reverence of the divine Lacedemonian policy, so great, so\nadmirable, and so long flourishing in virtue and happiness, without any\ninstitution or practice of letters, ought certainly to be of very great\nweight. Such as return from the new world discovered by the Spaniards\nin our fathers\u2019 days, testify to us how much more honestly and regularly\nthose nations live, without magistrate and without law, than ours do,\nwhere there are more officers and lawyers than there are of other sorts\nof men and business:--\n\n\n      Di cittatorie piene, e di libelli,\n   D\u2019esamine, e di carte di procure,\n   Hanno le mani e il seno, e gran fastelli\n   Di chioge, di consigli, et di letture:\n   Per cui le faculta de* poverelli\n   Non sono mai nelle citt\u00e0 sicure;\n   Hanno dietro e dinanzi, e d\u2019ambi i lati,\n   Notai, procuratori, ed avvocati.\n\n      \u201cTheir bags were full of writs, and of citations,\n   Of process, and of actions and arrests,\n   Of bills, of answers, and of replications,\n   In courts of delegates, and of requests,\n   To grieve the simple sort with great vexations;\n   They had resorting to them as their guests,\n   Attending on their circuit, and their journeys,\n   Scriv\u2019ners, and clerks, and lawyers, and attorneys.\u201d\n\n\nIt was what a Roman senator of the latter ages said, that their\npredecessors\u2019 breath stunk of garlic, but their stomachs were perfumed\nwith a good conscience; and that, on the contrary, those of his time\nwere all sweet odour without, but stunk within of all sorts of vices;\nthat is to say, as I interpret it, that they abounded with learning\nand eloquence, but were very defective in moral honesty. Incivility,\nignorance, simplicity, roughness, are the natural companions of\ninnocence; curiosity, subtlety, knowledge, bring malice in their train;\nhumility, fear, obedience, and affability, which are the principal\nthings that support and maintain human society, require an empty and\ndocile soul, and little presuming upon itself.\n\nChristians have a particular knowledge, how natural and original an evil\ncuriosity is in man; the thirst of knowledge, and the desire to\nbecome more wise, was the first ruin of man, and the way by which he\nprecipitated himself into eternal damnation. Pride was his ruin and\ncorruption. \u2018Tis pride that diverts him from the common path, and makes\nhim embrace novelties, and rather choose to be head of a troop, lost and\nwandering in the path of error; to be a master and a teacher of lies,\nthan to be a disciple in the school of truth, suffering himself to be\nled and guided by the hand of another, in the right and beaten\nroad. \u2018Tis, peradventure, the meaning of this old Greek saying, that\nsuperstition follows pride, and obeys it as if it were a father:\n[--Greek--] Ah, presumption, how much dost thou hinder us?\n\nAfter that Socrates was told that the god of wisdom had assigned to him\nthe title of sage, he was astonished at it, and, searching and examining\nhimself throughout, could find no foundation for this divine judgment.\nHe knew others as just, temperate, valiant, and learned, as himself; and\nmore eloquent, more handsome, and more profitable to their country than\nhe. At last he concluded that he was not distinguished from others, nor\nwise, but only because he did not think himself so; and that his God\nconsidered the opinion of knowledge and wisdom as a singular absurdity\nin man; and that his best doctrine was the doctrine of ignorance, and\nsimplicity his best wisdom. The sacred word declares those miserable\namong us who have an opinion of themselves: \u201cDust and ashes,\u201d says it\nto such, \u201cwhat hast thou wherein to glorify thyself?\u201d And, in another\nplace, \u201cGod has made man like unto a shadow,\u201d of whom who can judge,\nwhen by removing the light it shall be vanished! Man is a thing of\nnothing.\n\nOur force is so far from being able to comprehend the divine height,\nthat, of the works of our Creator, those best bear his mark, and are\nwith better title his, which we the least understand. To meet with an\nincredible thing is an occasion to Christians to believe; and it is\nso much the more according to reason, by how much it is against human\nreason. If it were according to reason, it would be no more a miracle;\nand if it were according to example, it would be no longer a singular\nthing. _Melius scitur Deus nesdendo_: \u201cGod is better known by not\nknowing him,\u201d says St. Austin: and Tacitus, _Sanctius est ac reverentius\nde actis Deorum credere, quam scire_; \u201cit is more holy and reverent to\nbelieve the works of God than to know them;\u201d and Plato thinks there is\nsomething of impiety in inquiring too curiously into God, the world,\nand the first causes of things: _Atque illum quidem parentem hujus\nuniversitaiis invenire, difficile; et, quum jam inveneris, indicare in\nvulgtis, nefas_: \u201cto find out the parent of the world is very difficult;\nand when found out, to reveal him to the vulgar is sin,\u201d says Cicero. We\ntalk indeed of power, truth, justice; which are words that signify some\ngreat thing; but that thing we neither see nor conceive at all. We say\nthat God fears, that God is angry, that God loves,\n\n\n   Immortalia mortali sermone notantes:\n\n   \u201cGiving to things immortal mortal names.\u201d\n\n\nThese are all agitations and emotions that cannot be in God, according\nto our form, nor can we imagine them, according to his. It only belongs\nto God to know himself, and to interpret his own works; and he does it\nin our language, going out of himself, to stoop to us who grovel upon\nthe earth. How can prudence, which is the choice between good and evil,\nbe properly attributed to him whom no evil can touch? How can reason\nand intelligence, which we make use of, to arrive by obscure at apparent\nthings; seeing that nothing is obscure to him? How justice, which\ndistributes to every one what appertains to him, a thing begot by the\nsociety and community of men, how is that in God? How temperance, which\nis the moderation of corporal pleasures, that have no place in the\nDivinity? Fortitude to support pain, labour, and dangers, as little\nappertains to him as the rest; these three things have no access to\nhim. For which reason Aristotle holds him equally exempt from virtue\nand vice: _Neque gratia, neque ira teneri potest; quod quo talia essent,\nimbecilla essent omnia?_ \u201cHe can neither be affected with favour nor\nindignation, because both these are the effects of frailty.\u201d\n\nThe participation we have in the knowledge of truth, such as it is,\nis not acquired by our own force: God has sufficiently given us to\nunderstand that, by the witnesses he has chosen out of the common\npeople, simple and ignorant men, that he has been pleased to employ\nto instruct us in his admirable secrets. Our faith is not of our\nown acquiring; \u2018tis purely the gift of another\u2019s bounty: \u2018tis not by\nmeditation, or by virtue of our own understanding, that we have\nacquired our religion, but by foreign authority and command wherein the\nimbecility of our own judgment does more assist us than any force of it;\nand our blindness more than our clearness of sight: \u2018tis more by__ the\nmediation of our ignorance than of our knowledge that we know any thing\nof the divine wisdom. \u2018Tis no wonder if our natural and earthly parts\ncannot conceive that supernatural and heavenly knowledge: let us bring\nnothing of our own, but obedience and subjection; for, as it is written,\n\u201cI will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the\nunderstanding of the prudent. Where is the wise? Where is the scribe?\nWhere is the disputer of this world? Hath not God made foolish the\nwisdom of this world? For after that, in the wisdom of God, the world\nknew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save\nthem that believe.\u201d\n\nFinally, should I examine whether it be in the power of man to find out\nthat which he seeks and if that quest, wherein he has busied himself so\nmany ages, has enriched him with any new force, or any solid truth; I\nbelieve he will confess, if he speaks from his conscience, that all\nhe has got by so long inquiry is only to have learned to know his\nown weakness. We have only by a long study confirmed and verified the\nnatural ignorance we were in before. The same has fallen out to men\ntruly wise, which befalls the ears of corn; they shoot and raise their\nheads high and pert, whilst empty; but when full and swelled with grain\nin maturity, begin to flag and droop. So men, having tried and sounded\nall things, and having found in that mass of knowledge, and provision of\nso many various things, nothing solid and firm, and nothing but\nvanity, have quitted their presumption, and acknowledged their natural\ncondition. \u2018Tis what Velleius reproaches Cotta withal and Cicero, \u201cthat\nthey had learned of Philo, that they had learned nothing.\u201d Pherecydes,\none of the seven sages, writing to Thales upon his death-bed; \u201cI have,\u201d\n said he, \u201cgiven order to my people, after my interment, to carry my\nwritings to thee. If they please thee and the other sages, publish; if\nnot, suppress them. They contain no certainty with which I myself am\nsatisfied. Neither do I pretend to know the truth, or to attain to it.\nI rather open than discover things.\u201d The wisest man that ever was, being\nasked what he knew, made answer, \u201cHe knew this, that he knew nothing.\u201d\n By which he verified what has been said, that the greatest part of what\nwe know is the least of what we do not; that is to say, that even\nwhat we think we know is but a piece, and a very little one, of our\nignorance. We know things in dreams, says Plato, and are ignorant of\nthem in truth. _Ormes pene veteres nihil cognosci, nihil percipi,\nnihil sciri posse dixerunt; angustos sensus, imbecilles animos, brevia\ncurricula vito._ \u201cAlmost all the ancients have declared that there is\nnothing to be known, nothing to be perceived or understood; the senses\nare too limited, men\u2019s minds too weak, and the course of life too short.\u201d\n And of Cicero himself, who stood indebted to his learning for all he\nwas worth, Valerius says, \u201cThat he began to disrelish letters in his old\nage; and when at his studies, it was with great independency upon any\none party; following what he thought probable, now in one sect, and\nthen in another, evermore wavering under the doubts of the academy.\u201d\n _Dicendum est, sed ita ut nihil affirment, quceram omnia, dubitans\nplerumque, et mihi diffidens._ \u201cSomething I must say, but so as to\naffirm nothing; I inquire into all things, but for the most part in\ndoubt and distrust of myself.\u201d\n\nI should have too fair a game should I consider man in his common way of\nliving and in gross; yet I might do it by his own rule, who judges truth\nnot by weight, but by the number of votes. Let us set the people aside,\n\n\n      Qui vigilans stertit,....\n   Mortua cui vita est prope jam vivo atque videnti;\n\n     \u201cHalf of his life by lazy sleep\u2019s possess\u2019d,\n   And when awake his soul but nods at best;\u201d\n\n\nwho neither feel nor judge, and let most of their natural faculties lie\nidle; I will take man in his highest ground. Let us consider him in\nthat little number of men, excellent and culled out from the rest, who,\nhaving been endowed with a remarkable and particular natural force, have\nmoreover hardened and whetted it by care, study, and art, and raised\nit to the highest pitch of wisdom to which it can possibly arrive. They\nhave adjusted their souls to all ways and all biases; have propped and\nsupported them with all foreign helps proper for them, and enriched and\nadorned them with all they could borrow for their advantage, both within\nand without the world; \u2018tis in these is placed the utmost and most\nsupreme height to which human nature can attain. They have regulated\nthe world with policies and laws. They have instructed it with arts and\nsciences, and by the example of their admirable manners. I shall make\naccount of none but such men as these, their testimony and experience.\nLet us examine how far they have proceeded, and where they stopped. The\nerrors and defects that we shall find amongst these men the world may\nboldly avow as their own.\n\nWhoever goes in search of any thing must come to this, either to say\nthat he has found it, or that it is not to be found, or that he is yet\nupon the search. All philosophy is divided into these three kinds; her\ndesign is to seek out truth, knowledge, and certainty. The Peripatetics,\nEpicureans, Stoics, and others, have thought they have found it. These\nestablished the sciences we have, and have treated of them as of certain\nknowledge. Clitomachus, Carneades, and the Academics, have despaired\nin their search, and concluded that truth could not be conceived by our\nunderstandings. The result of these is weakness and human ignorance.\nThis sect has had the most and the most noble followers. Pyrrho, and\nother skeptics or epechists, whose dogmas are held by many of the\nancients to be taken from Homer, the seven sages, and from Archilochus\nand Euripides, and to whose number these are added, Zeno, Democritus,\nand Xenophanes, say that they are yet upon the inquiry after truth.\nThese conclude that the others, who think they have found it out, are\ninfinitely deceived; and that it is too daring a vanity in the second\nsort to determine that human reason is not able to attain unto it;\nfor this establishing a standard of our power, to know and judge the\ndifficulty of things, is a great and extreme knowledge, of which they\ndoubt whether man is capable:--\n\n\n      Nil sciri quisquis putat, id quoque nescit,\n   An sciri possit; quam se nil scire fatetur.\n\n      \u201cHe that says nothing can be known, o\u2019erthrows\n   His own opinion, for he nothing knows,\n   So knows not that.\u201d\n\n\nThe ignorance that knows itself, judges and condemns itself, is not an\nabsolute ignorance; to be such, it must be ignorant of itself; so that\nthe profession of the Pyrrhonians is to waver, doubt, and inquire, not\nto make themselves sure of, or responsible to themselves for any\nthing. Of the three actions of the soul, imaginative, appetitive, and\nconsentive, they receive the two first; the last they kept ambiguous,\nwithout inclination or approbation, either of one thing or another,\nso light as it is. Zeno represented the motion of his imagination upon\nthese divisions of the faculties of the soul thus: \u201cAn open and expanded\nhand signified appearance; a hand half shut, and the fingers a little\nbending, consent; a clenched fist, comprehension; when with the left\nhe yet thrust the right fist closer, knowledge.\u201d Now this situation of\ntheir judgment upright and inflexible, receiving all objects without\napplication or consent, leads them to their ataraxy, which is a\npeaceable condition of life, temperate, and exempt from the agitations\nwe receive by the impression of opinion and knowledge that we think we\nhave of things; whence spring fear, avarice, envy, immoderate desires,\nambition, pride, superstition, love of novelty, rebellion, disobedience,\nobstinacy, and the greatest part of bodily ills; nay, and by that they\nare exempt from the jealousy of their discipline; for they debate after\na very gentle manner; they fear no requital in their disputes; when they\naffirm that heavy things descend they would be sorry to be believed,\nand love tobe contradicted, to engender doubt and suspense of judgment,\nwhich is their end. They only put forward their propositions to\ncontend with those they think we have in our belief. If you take their\narguments, they will as readily maintain the contrary; \u2018tis all one to\nthem, they have no choice. If you maintain that snow is black, they will\nargue on the contrary that it is white; if you say it is neither the\none nor the other, they will maintain that it is both. If you hold, of\ncertain judgment, that you know nothing, they will maintain that you do.\nYea, and if by an affirmative axiom you assure them that you doubt, they\nwill argue against you that you doubt not; or that you cannot judge and\ndetermine that you doubt. And by this extremity of doubt, which jostles\nitself, they separate and divide themselves from many opinions, even\nof those they have several ways maintained, both concerning doubt and\nignorance. \u201cWhy shall not they be allowed to doubt,\u201d say they, \u201cas well\nas the dogmatists, one of whom says green, another yellow? Can any thing\nbe proposed to us to grant, or deny, which it shall not be permitted to\nconsider as ambiguous?\u201d And where others are carried away, either by\nthe custom of their country, or by the instruction of parents, or by\naccident, as by a tempest, without judgment and without choice, nay,\nand for the most part before the age of discretion, to such and such\nan opinion, to the sect whether Stoic or Epicurean, with which they\nare prepossessed, enslaved, and fast bound, as to a thing they cannot\nforsake: _Ad quamcumque disciplinant, velut tempestate, delati, ad earn,\ntanquam ad saxum, adhorescunt;_ \u201cevery one cleaves to the doctrine he\nhas happened upon, as to a rock against which he has been thrown by\ntempest;\u201d why shall not these likewise be permitted to maintain their\nliberty, and consider things without obligation or slavery? _hoc\nliberiores et solutiores, quod integra illis est judicandi potestas_:\n\u201cin this more unconstrained and free, because they have the greater\npower of judging.\u201d Is it not of some advantage to be disengaged from the\nnecessity that curbs others? Is it not better to remain in suspense than\nto entangle one\u2019s self in the innumerable errors that human fancy has\nproduced? Is it not much better to suspend one\u2019s persuasion than to\nintermeddle with these wrangling and seditious divisions: \u201cWhat shall\nI choose?\u201d \u201cWhat you please, provided you will choose.\u201d A very foolish\nanswer; but such a one, nevertheless, as all dogmatism seems to point\nat, and by which we are not permitted to be ignorant of what we are\nignorant of.\n\nTake the most eminent side, that of the greatest reputation; it will\nnever be so sure that you shall not be forced to attack and contend with\na hundred and a hundred adversaries to defend it. Is it not better to\nkeep out of this hurly-burly? You are permitted to embrace Aristotle\u2019s\nopinions of the immortality of the soul with as much zeal as your honour\nand life, and to give the lie to Plato thereupon, and shall they be\ninterdicted to doubt him? If it be lawful for Pan\u00e6tius to maintain\nhis opinion about augury, dreams, oracles, vaticinations, of which the\nStoics made no doubt at all; why may not a wise man dare to do the\nsame in all things that he dared to do in those he had learned of his\nmasters, established by the common consent of the school, whereof he\nis a professor and a member? If it be a child that judges, he knows not\nwhat it is; if a wise man, he is prepossessed. They have reserved for\nthemselves a marvellous advantage in battle, having eased themselves of\nthe care of defence. If you strike them, they care not, provided\nthey strike too, and they turn every thing to their own use. If they\novercome, your argument is lame; if you, theirs; if they fall short,\nthey verify ignorance; if you fall short, you do it; if they prove that\nnothing is known, \u2018tis well; if they cannot prove it, \u2018tis also well:\n_Ut quurn in eadem re paria contrariis in partibus momenta inveniuntur,\nfacilius ab utraque parte assertio sustineatur:_ \u201cThat when like\nsentiments happen _pro_ and _con_ in the same thing, the assent may on\nboth sides be more easily suspended.\u201d And they make account to find out,\nwith much greater facility, why a thing is false, than why \u2018tis true;\nthat which is not, than that which is; and what they do not believe,\nthan what they do. Their way of speaking is: \u201cI assert nothing; it is no\nmore so than so, or than neither one nor t\u2019other; I understand it not.\nAppearances are everywhere equal; the law of speaking, _pro_ or _con_,\nis the same. Nothing seems true, that may not seem false.\u201d Their\nsacramental word is that is to say, \u201cI hold, I stir not.\u201d This is the\nburden of their song, and others of like stuff. The effect of which is\na pure, entire, perfect, and absolute suspension of judgment. They make\nuse of their reason to inquire and debate, but not to fix and determine.\nWhoever shall imagine a perpetual confession of ignorance, a judgment\nwithout bias, propension, or inclination, upon any occasion whatever,\nconceives a true idea of Pyrrhonism. I express this fancy as well as\nI can, by reason that many find it hard to conceive, and the authors\nthemselves represent it a little variously and obscurely.\n\nAs to what concerns the actions of life, they are in this of the\ncommon fashion. They yield and give up themselves to their natural\ninclinations, to the power and impulse of passions, to the constitution\nof laws and customs, and to the tradition of arts; _Non enim nos Deus\nista scire, sed tantummodo uti, voluit._ \u201cFor God would not have us\nknow, but only use those things.\u201d They suffer their ordinary actions to\nbe guided by those things, without any dispute or judgment. For\nwhich reason I cannot consent to what is said of Pyrrho, by those\nwho represent him heavy and immovable, leading a kind of savage and\nunsociable life, standing the jostle of carts, going upon the edge of\nprecipices, and refusing to accommodate himself to the laws. This is to\nenhance upon his discipline; he would never make himself a stock or\na stone, he would show himself a living man, discoursing, reasoning,\nenjoying all reasonable conveniences and pleasures, employing and making\nuse of all his corporal and spiritual faculties in rule and reason.\nThe fantastic, imaginary, and false privileges that man had usurped\nof lording it, ordaining, and establishing, he has utterly quitted and\nrenounced. Yet there is no sect but is constrained to permit her sage to\nfollow several things not comprehended, perceived, or consented to, if\nhe means to live. And if he goes to sea, he follows that design, not\nknowing whether his voyage shall be successful or no; and only insists\nupon the tightness of the vessel, the experience of the pilot, and the\nconvenience of the season, and such probable circumstances; after which\nhe is bound to go, and suffer himself to be governed by appearances,\nprovided there be no express and manifest contrariety in them. He has a\nbody, he has a soul; the senses push them, the mind spurs them on. And\nalthough he does not find in himself this proper and singular sign of\njudging, and that he perceives that he ought not to engage his\nconsent, considering that there may be some false, equal to these true\nappearances, yet does he not, for all that, fail of carrying on the\noffices of his life with great liberty and convenience. How many arts\nare there that profess to consist more in conjecture than knowledge;\nthat decide not on true and false, and only follow that which seems so!\nThere are, say they, true and false, and we have in us wherewith to seek\nit; but not to make it stay when we touch it. We are much more prudent,\nin letting ourselves be regulated by the order of the world, without\ninquiry. A soul clear from prejudice has a marvellous advance towards\ntranquillity and repose. Men that judge and control their judges, do\nnever duly submit to them.\n\nHow much more docile and easy to be governed, both by the laws of\nreligion and civil polity, are simple and incurious minds, than those\nover-vigilant wits, that will still be prating of divine and human\ncauses! There is nothing in human invention that carries so great a show\nof likelihood and utility as this; this presents man, naked and empty,\nconfessing his natural weakness, fit to receive some foreign force from\nabove, unfurnished of human, and therefore more apt to receive into him\nthe divine knowledge, making nought of his own judgment, to give more\nroom to faith; neither disbelieving nor establishing any dogma against\ncommon observances; humble, obedient, disciplinable, and studious; a\nsworn enemy of heresy; and consequently freeing himself from vain and\nirreligious opinions, introduced by false sects. \u2018Tis a blank paper\nprepared to receive such forms from the finger of God as he shall please\nto write upon it. The more we resign and commit ourselves to God, and\nthe more we renounce ourselves, of the greater value we are. \u201cTake in\ngood part,\u201d says Ecclesiastes, \u201cthe things that present themselves to\nthee, as they seem and taste from hand to mouth; the rest is out of thy\nknowledge.\u201d _Dominus novit cogitationes hominum, quoniam van\u00e6 sunt_:\n\u201cThe Lord knoweth the hearts of men, that they are but vanity.\u201d\n\nThus we see that of the three general sects of philosophy, two make open\nprofession of doubt and ignorance; and in that of the Dogmatists, which\nis the third, it is easy to discover that the greatest part of them only\nassume this face of confidence and assurance that\n\nthey may produce the better effect; they have not so much thought\nto establish any certainty for us, as to show us how far they have\nproceeded in their search of truth: _Quam docti jingunt magis quam\nn\u00f4runt_: \u201cWhich the learned rather feign than know.\u201d Tim\u00e6us, being\nto instruct Socrates in what he knew of the gods, the world, and men,\nproposes to speak to him as a man to a man; and that it is sufficient,\nif his reasons are probable as those of another; for that exact\nreasons were neither in his nor any other mortal hand; which one of\nhis followers has thus imitated: _Ut potero, explicabo: nec tamen, ut\nPythius Apollo, certa ut sint et fixa qu\u00e6 dixero; sed, ut homunculus,\nprobabilia conjectur\u00e2 sequens:_ \u201cI will, as well as I am able, explain;\naffirming, yet not as the Pythian oracle, that what I say is fixed and\ncertain, but like a mere man, that follows probabilities by conjecture.\u201d\n And this, upon the natural and common subject of the contempt of death;\nhe has elsewhere translated from the very words of Plato: _Si forte, de\nDeorum natur\u00e2 ortuque mundi disserentes, minus id quod habemiis in animo\nconsequi-mur, haud erit mirum; oquum est enim meminisse, et me, qui\ndisseram, hominem esse, et vos, qui judicetis, ut, si probabilia\ndicentur, nihil ultra requiratis?_ \u201cIf perchance, when we discourse\nof the nature of God, and the world\u2019s original, we cannot do it as we\ndesire, it will be no great wonder. For it is just you should remember\nthat both I who speak and you who are to judge, are men; so that if\nprobable things are delivered, you shall require and expect no more.\u201d\n Aristotle ordinarily heaps up a great number of other men\u2019s opinions and\nbeliefs, to compare them with his own, and to let us see how much he has\ngone beyond them, and how much nearer he approaches to the likelihood of\ntruth; for truth is not to be judged by the authority and testimony\nof others; which made Epicurus religiously avoid quoting them in his\nwritings. This is the prince of all dogmatists, and yet we are told by\nhim that the more we know the more we have room for doubt. In earnest,\nwe sometimes see him shroud and muffle up himself in so thick and so\ninextricable an obscurity that we know not what to make of his advice;\nit is, in effect, a Pyrrhonism under a resolutive form. Hear Cicero\u2019s\nprotestation, who expounds to us another\u2019s fancy by his own: _Qui\nrequirunt quid de qu\u00e2que re ipsi sentiamus, curiosius id faciunt quam\nnecesse est,... Hoc in philosophi\u00e2 ratio, contra omnia disserendi,\nnuttamque rem aperte judicandi, profecta a Socrate, repetita\nab Arcesila, conjirmata a Gameade, usqu\u00ea ad nostram viget\ncetatem..........Hi sumus, qui omnibus veris falsa quodam adjuncta esse\ndicamus, tanta similitudine, ut in iis nulla insit certe judicandi et\nassentiendi nota._ \u201cThey who desire to know what we think of every\nthing are therein more inquisitive than is necessary. This practice\nin philosophy of disputing against every thing, and of absolutely\nconcluding nothing, begun by Socrates, repeated by Arcesilaus, and\nconfirmed by Cameades, has continued in use even to our own times. We\nare they who declare that there is so great a mixture of things false\namongst all that are true, and they so resemble one another, that there\ncan be in them no certain mark to direct us either to judge or assent.\u201d\n Why hath not Aristotle only, but most of the philosophers, affected\ndifficulty, if not to set a greater value upon the vanity of the\nsubject, and amuse the curiosity of our minds by giving them this hollow\nand fleshless bone to pick? Clitomachus affirmed \u201cThat he could never\ndiscover by Carneades\u2019s writings what opinion he was of.\u201d This was it\nthat made Epicurus affect to be abstruse, and that procured Heraclitus\nthe epithet of [--Greek--] Difficulty is a coin the learned make use\nof, like jugglers, to conceal the vanity of their art, and which human\nsottishness easily takes for current pay.\n\n\n      Claras, ob obscuram linguam, magis inter manes...\n   Omnia enim stolidi magis admirantur amantque\n   Inversis qu\u00e6 sub verbis latitantia cemunt.\n\n      \u201cBombast and riddle best do puppies please,\n   For fools admire and love such things as these;\n   And a dull quibble, wrapt in dubious phrase,\n   Up to the height doth their wise wonder raise.\u201d\n\n\nCicero reprehends some of his friends for giving more of their time\nto the study of astrology, logic, and geometry, than they were really\nworth; saying that they were by these diverted from the duties of life,\nand more profitable and proper studies. The Cyrenaick philosophers, in\nlike manner, despised physics and logic. Zeno, in the very beginning of\nthe books of the commonwealth, declared all the liberal arts of no use.\nChrysippus said \u201cThat what Plato and Aristotle had writ, concerning\nlogic, they had only done in sport, and by way of exercise;\u201d and could\nnot believe that they spoke in earnest of so vain a thing. Plutarch\nsays the same of metaphysics. And Epicurus would have said as much\nof rhetoric, grammar, poetry, mathematics, and, natural philosophy\nexcepted, of all the sciences; and Socrates of them all, excepting that\nwhich treats of manners and of life. Whatever any one required to be\ninstructed in, by him, he would ever, in the first place, demand\nan account of the conditions of his life present and past, which he\nexamined and judged, esteeming all other learning subsequent to that\nand supernumerary: _Parum mihi placeant e\u00e6 littero quo ad virtutem\ndoctoribus nihil pro-fuerunt._ \u201cThat learning is in small repute with me\nwhich nothing profited the teachers themselves to virtue.\u201d Most of the\narts have been in like manner decried by the same knowledge; but they\ndid not consider that it was from the purpose to exercise their wits in\nthose very matters wherein there was no solid advantage.\n\nAs to the rest, some have looked upon Plato as a dogmatist, others as a\ndoubter, others in some things the one, and in other things the other.\nSocrates, the conductor of his dialogues, is eternally upon questions\nand stirring up disputes, never determining, never satisfying, and\nprofesses to have no other science but that of opposing himself. Homer,\ntheir author, has equally laid the foundations of all the sects of\nphilosophy, to show how indifferent it was which way we should choose.\n\u2018Tis said that ten several sects sprung from Plato; yet, in my opinion,\nnever did any instruction halt and stumble, if his does not.\n\nSocrates said that midwives, in taking upon them the trade of helping\nothers to bring forth, left the trade of bringing forth themselves; and\nthat by the title of a wise man or sage, which the gods had conferred\nupon him, he was disabled, in his virile and mental love, of the faculty\nof bringing forth, contenting himself to help and assist those that\ncould; to open their nature, anoint the passes, and facilitate their\nbirth; to judge of the infant, baptize, nourish, fortify, swath, and\ncircumcise it, exercising and employing his understanding in the perils\nand fortunes of others.\n\nIt is so with the most part of this third sort of authors, as the\nancients have observed in the writings of Anaxagoras, Democritus,\nParmenides, Xenophanes, and others. They have a way of writing, doubtful\nin substance and design, rather inquiring than teaching, though they mix\ntheir style with some dogmatical periods. Is not the same thing seen in\nSeneca and Plutarch? How many contradictions are there to be found if a\nman pry narrowly into them! So many that the reconciling lawyers ought\nfirst to reconcile them every one to themselves. Plato seems to have\naffected this method of philosophizing in dialogues; to the end that he\nmight with greater decency, from several mouths, deliver the diversity\nand variety of his own fancies. It is as well to treat variously of\nthings as to treat of them conformably, and better, that is to say, more\ncopiously and with greater profit. Let us take example from ourselves:\njudgments are the utmost point of all dogmatical and determinative\nspeaking; and yet those _arrets_ that our parliaments give the people,\nthe most exemplary of them, and those most proper to nourish in them the\nreverence due to that dignity, principally through the sufficiency of\nthe persons acting, derive their beauty not so much from the conclusion,\nwhich with them is quotidian and common to every judge, as from the\ndispute and heat of divers and contrary arguments that the matter of law\nand equity will permit And the largest field for reprehension that\nsome philosophers have against others is drawn from the diversities and\ncontradictions wherein every one of them finds himself perplexed, either\non purpose to show the vacillation of the human mind concerning every\nthing, or ignorantly compelled by the volubility and incomprehensibility\nof all matter; which is the meaning of the maxim--\u201cIn a slippery and\nsliding place let us suspend our belief;\u201d for, as Euripides says,--\n\n\n   \u201cGod\u2019s various works perplex the thoughts of men.\u201d\n\n\nLike that which Empedocles, as if transported with a divine fury, and\ncompelled by truth, often strewed here and there in his writings: \u201cNo,\nno, we feel nothing, we see nothing; all things are concealed from\nus; there is not one thing of which we can positively say what it is;\u201d\n according to the divine saying: _Cogitationes mortalium timid\u00e6, et\nincert\u00e6 adinventiones nostro et providentice._ \u201cFor the thoughts of\nmortal men are doubtful; and our devices are but uncertain.\u201d It is not\nto be thought strange if men, despairing to overtake what they hunt\nafter, have not however lost the pleasure of the chase; study being\nof itself so pleasant an employment; and so pleasant that amongst the\npleasures, the Stoics forbid that also which proceeds from the exercise\nof the mind, will have it curbed, and find a kind of intemperance in too\nmuch knowledge.\n\nDemocritus having eaten figs at his table that tasted of honey, fell\npresently to considering with himself whence they should derive this\nunusual sweetness; and to be satisfied in it, was about to rise from the\ntable to see the place whence the figs had been gathered; which his maid\nobserving, and having understood the cause, smilingly told him that \u201che\nneed not trouble himself about that, for she had put them into a vessel\nin which there had been honey.\u201d He was vexed at this discovery, and that\nshe had deprived him of the occasion of this inquiry, and robbed his\ncuriosity of matter to work upon: \u201cGo thy way,\u201d said he, \u201cthou hast done\nme an injury; but, for all that, I will seek out the cause as if it\nwere natural;\u201d and would willingly have found out some true reason for a\nfalse and imaginary effect. This story of a famous and great philosopher\nvery clearly represents to us that studious passion that puts us upon\nthe pursuit of things, of the acquisition of which we despair. Plutarch\ngives a like example of some one who would not be satisfied in that\nwhereof he was in doubt, that he might not lose the pleasure of\ninquiring into it; like the other who would not that his physician\nshould allay the thirst of his fever, that he might not lose the\npleasure of quenching it by drinking. _Satius est supervacua discere,\nquam nihil._ \u201c\u2018Tis better to learn more than necessary than nothing at\nall.\u201d As in all sorts of feeding, the pleasure of eating is very often\nsingle and alone, and that what we take, which is acceptable to the\npalate, is not always nourishing or wholesome; so that which our minds\nextract from science does not cease to be pleasant, though there\nbe nothing in it either nutritive or healthful. Thus they say: \u201cThe\nconsideration of nature is a diet proper for our minds, it raises and\nelevates us, makes us disdain low and terrestrial things, by comparing\nthem with those that are celestial and high. The mere inquisition into\ngreat and occult things is very pleasant, even to those who acquire no\nother benefit than the reverence and fear of judging it.\u201d This is\nwhat they profess. The vain image of this sickly curiosity is yet more\nmanifest in this other example which they so often urge. \u201cEudoxus wished\nand begged of the gods that he might once see the sun near at hand, to\ncomprehend the form, greatness, and beauty of it; even though he should\nthereby be immediately burned.\u201d He would at the price of his life\npurchase a knowledge, of which the use and possession should at the same\ntime be taken from him; and for this sudden and vanishing knowledge\nlose all the other knowledge he had in present, or might afterwards have\nacquired.\n\nI cannot easily persuade myself that Epicurus, Plato, and Pytagoras,\nhave given us their atom, idea and numbers, for current pay. They were\ntoo wise to establish their articles of faith upon things so disputable\nand uncertain. But in that obscurity and ignorance in which the world\nthen was, every one of these great men endeavoured to present some kind\nof image or reflection of light, and worked their brains for inventions\nthat might have a pleasant and subtle appearance; provided that, though\nfalse, they might make good their ground against those that would oppose\nthem. _Unicuique ista pro ingenio finguntur, non ex scienti\u00e6 vi._ \u201cThese\nthings every one fancies according to his wit, and not by any power of\nknowledge.\u201d\n\nOne of the ancients, who was reproached, \u201cThat he professed philosophy,\nof which he nevertheless in his own judgment made no great account,\u201d\n made answer, \u201cThat this was truly to philosophize.\u201d\n\nThey wished to consider all, to balance every thing, and found that an\nemployment well suited to our natural curiosity. Some things they wrote\nfor the benefit of public society, as their religions; and for that\nconsideration it was but reasonable that they should not examine public\nopinions to the quick, that they might not disturb the common obedience\nto the laws and customs of their country.\n\nPlato treats of this mystery with a raillery manifest enough; for where\nhe writes according to his own method he gives no certain rule. When he\nplays the legislator he borrows a magisterial and positive style, and\nboldly there foists in his most fantastic inventions, as fit to persuade\nthe vulgar, as impossible to be believed by himself; knowing very well\nhow fit we are to receive all sorts of impressions, especially the most\nimmoderate and preposterous; and yet, in his _Laws_, he takes singular\ncare that nothing be sung in public but poetry, of which the fiction and\nfabulous relations tend to some advantageous end; it being so easy to\nimprint all sorts of phantasms in human minds, that it were injustice\nnot to feed them rather with profitable untruths than with untruths that\nare unprofitable and hurtful. He says very roundly, in his _Republic,_\n\u201cThat it is often necessary, for the benefit of men, to deceive them.\u201d\n It is very easy to distinguish that some of the sects have more followed\ntruth, and the others utility, by which the last have gained their\nreputation. \u2018Tis the misery of our condition that often that which\npresents itself to our imagination for the truest does not appear the\nmost useful to life. The boldest sects, as the Epicurean, Pyrrhonian,\nand the new Academic, are yet constrained to submit to the civil law at\nthe end of the account.\n\nThere are other subjects that they have tumbled and tossed about, some\nto the right and others to the left, every one endeavouring, right or\nwrong, to give them some kind of colour; for, having found nothing so\nabstruse that they would not venture to speak of, they are very\noften forced to forge weak and ridiculous conjectures; not that they\nthemselves looked upon them as any foundation, or establishing any\ncertain truth, but merely for exercise. _Non tam id sensisse quod\ndicerent, quam exercere ing\u00e9nia materio difficultate videntur voluisse._\n\u201cThey seem not so much themselves to have believed what they said, as to\nhave had a mind to exercise their wits in the difficulty of the\nmatter.\u201d And if we did not take it thus, how should we palliate so\ngreat inconstancy, variety, and vanity of opinions, as we see have been\nproduced by those excellent and admirable men? As, for example, what\ncan be more vain than to imagine, to guess at God, by our analogies and\nconjectures? To direct and govern him and the world by our capacities\nand our laws? And to serve ourselves, at the expense of the divinity,\nwith what small portion of capacity he has been pleased to impart to\nour natural condition; and because we cannot extend our sight to his\nglorious throne, to have brought him down to our corruption and our\nmiseries?\n\nOf all human and ancient opinions concerning religion, that seems to\nme the most likely and most excusable, that acknowledged God as an\nincomprehensible power, the original and preserver of all things, all\ngoodness, all perfection, receiving and taking in good part the honour\nand reverence that man paid him, under what method, name, or ceremonies\nsoever--\n\n\n      Jupiter omnipotens, rerum, regumque, de\u00fbmque,\n   Progenitor, genitrixque.\n\n      \u201cJove, the almighty, author of all things,\n   The father, mother, of both gods and kings.\u201d\n\n\nThis zeal has universally been looked upon from heaven with a gracious\neye. All governments have reaped fruit from their devotion; impious\nmen and actions have everywhere had suitable events. Pagan histories\nacknowledge dignity, order, justice, prodigies, and oracles, employed\nfor their profit and instruction in their fabulous religions; God,\nthrough his mercy, vouchsafing, by these temporal benefits, to cherish\nthe tender principles of a kind of brutish knowledge that natural reason\ngave them of him, through the deceiving images of their dreams. Not only\ndeceiving and false, but impious also and injurious, are those that man\nhas forged from his own invention: and of all the religions that St.\nPaul found in repute at Athens, that which they had dedicated \u201cto the\nunknown God\u201d seemed to him the most to be excused.\n\nPythagoras shadowed the truth a little more closely, judging that\nthe knowledge of this first cause and being of beings ought to be\nindefinite, without limitation, without declaration; that it was nothing\nelse than the extreme effort of our imagination towards perfection,\nevery one amplifying the idea according to the talent of his capacity.\nBut if Numa attempted to conform the devotion of his people to this\nproject; to attach them to a religion purely mental, without any\nprefixed object and material mixture, he undertook a thing of no use;\nthe human mind could never support itself floating in such an infinity\nof inform thoughts; there is required some certain image to be presented\naccording to its own model. The divine majesty has thus, in some sort,\nsuffered himself to be circumscribed in corporal limits for our\nadvantage. His supernatural and celestial sacraments have signs of our\nearthly condition; his adoration is by sensible offices and words; for\n\u2018tis man that believes and prays. I shall omit the other arguments upon\nthis subject; but a man would have much ado to make me believe that the\nsight of our crucifixes, that the picture of our Saviour\u2019s passion, that\nthe ornaments and ceremonious motions of our churches, that the voices\naccommodated to the devotion of our thoughts, and that emotion of the\nsenses, do not warm the souls of the people with a religious passion of\nvery advantageous effect.\n\nOf those to whom they have given a body, as necessity required in that\nuniversal blindness, I should, I fancy, most incline to those who adored\nthe sun:--\n\n\n      La Lumi\u00e8re commune,\n   L\u2019oil du monde; et si Dieu au chef porte des yeux,\n   Les rayons du soleil sont ses yeulx radieux,\n   Qui donnent vie \u00e0 touts, nous maintiennent et gardent,\n   Et les faictsdes humains en ce monde regardent:\n   Ce beau, ce grand soleil qui nous faict les saisons,\n   Selon qu\u2019il entre ou sort de ses douze maisons;\n   Qui remplit l\u2019univers de ses vertus cognues;\n   Qui d\u2019un traict de ses yeulx nous dissipe les nues;\n   L\u2019esprit, l\u2019ame du monde, ardent et flamboyant,\n   En la course d\u2019un jour tout le Ciel tournoyant;\n   Plein d\u2019immense grandeur, rond, vagabond, et ferme;\n   Lequel tient dessoubs luy tout le monde pour terme:\n   En repos, sans repos; oysif, et sans s\u00e9jour;\n   Fils aisn\u00e9 de nature, et le p\u00e8re du jour:\n\n      \u201cThe common light that equal shines on all,\n   Diffused around the whole terrestrial ball;\n   And, if the almighty Ruler of the skies\n   Has eyes, the sunbeams are his radiant eyes,\n   That life and safety give to young and old,\n   And all men\u2019s actions upon earth behold.\n   This great, this beautiful, the glorious sun,\n   Who makes their course the varied seasons run;\n   That with his virtues fills the universe,\n   And with one glance can sullen clouds disperse;\n   Earth\u2019s life and soul, that, flaming in his sphere,\n   Surrounds the heavens in one day\u2019s career;\n   Immensely great, moving yet firm and round,\n   Who the whole world below has made his bound;\n   At rest, without rest, idle without stay,\n   Nature\u2019s first son, and father of the day:\u201d\n\n\nforasmuch as, beside this grandeur and beauty of his, \u2018tis the only\npiece of this machine that we discover at the remotest distance from us;\nand by that means so little known that they were pardonable for entering\ninto so great admiration and reverence of it.\n\nThales, who first inquired into this sort of matter, believed God to be\na Spirit that made all things of water; Anaximander, that the gods\nwere always dying and entering into life again; and that there were an\ninfinite number of worlds; Anaximines, that the air was God, that he\nwas procreate and immense, always moving. Anaxagoras the first, was of\nopinion that the description and manner of all things were conducted by\nthe power and reason of an infinite spirit. Alcm\u00e6on gave divinity to\nthe sun, moon, and stars, and to the soul. Pythagoras made God a spirit,\nspread over the nature of all things, whence our souls are extracted;\nParmenides, a circle surrounding the heaven, and supporting the world by\nthe ardour of light. Empedocles pronounced the four elements, of which\nall things are composed, to be gods; Protagoras had nothing to say,\nwhether they were or were not, or what they were; Democritus was one\nwhile of opinion that the images and their circuitions were gods;\nanother while, the nature that darts out those images; and then,\nour science and intelligence. Plato divides his belief into several\nopinions; he says, in his _Tim\u00e6us_, that the Father of the World cannot\nbe named; in his Laws, that men are not to inquire into his being; and\nelsewhere, in the very same books, he makes the world, the heavens, the\nstars, the earth, and our souls, gods; admitting, moreover, those which\nhave been received by ancient institution in every republic.\n\nXenophon reports a like perplexity in Socrates\u2019s doctrine; one while\nthat men are not to inquire into the form of God, and presently makes\nhim maintain that the sun is God, and the soul God; that there is but\none God, and then that there are many. Speusippus, the nephew of Plato,\nmakes God a certain power governing all things, and that he has a soul.\nAristotle one while says it is the spirit, and another the world; one\nwhile he gives the world another master, and another while makes God the\nheat of heaven. Zenocrates makes eight, five named amongst the planets;\nthe sixth composed of all the fixed stars, as of so many members; the\nseventh and eighth, the sun and moon. Heraclides Ponticus does nothing\nbut float in his opinion, and finally deprives God of sense, and makes\nhim shift from one form to another, and at last says that it is heaven\nand earth. Theophrastus wanders in the same irresolution amongst his\nfancies, attributing the superintendency of the world one while to the\nunderstanding, another while to heaven, and then to the stars. Strato\nsays that \u2018tis nature, she having the power of generation, augmentation,\nand diminution, without form and sentiment Zeno says \u2018tis the law of\nnature, commanding good and prohibiting evil; which law is an animal;\nand takes away the accustomed gods, Jupiter, Juno, and Vesta. Diogenes\nApolloniates, that \u2018tis air. Zenophanes makes God round, seeing and\nhearing, not breathing, and having nothing in common with human nature.\nAristo thinks the form of God to be incomprehensible, deprives him\nof sense, and knows not whether he be an animal or something else;\nCleanthes, one while supposes it to be reason, another while the world,\nanother the soul of nature, and then the supreme heat rolling about, and\nenvironing all. Perseus, Zeno\u2019s disciple, was of opinion that men have\ngiven the title of gods to such as have been useful, and have added\nany notable advantage to human life, and even to profitable things\nthemselves. Chrysippus made a confused heap of all the preceding\ntheories, and reckons, amongst a thousand forms of gods that he makes,\nthe men also that have been deified. Diagoras and Theodoras flatly\ndenied that there were any gods at all. Epicurus makes the gods shining,\ntransparent, and perflable, lodged as betwixt two forts, betwixt two\nworlds, secure from blows, clothed in a human figure, and with such\nmembers as we have; which members are to them of no use:--\n\n\n      Ego Deum genus esse semper duxi, et dicam colitum;\n   Sed eos non curare opinor quid agat humanum genus.\n\n      \u201cI ever thought that gods above there were,\n   But do not think they care what men do here.\u201d\n\n\nTrust to your philosophy, my masters; and brag that you have found\nthe bean in the cake when you see what a rattle is here with so many\nphilosophical heads! The perplexity of so many worldly forms has gained\nthis over me, that manners and opinions contrary to mine do not so much\ndisplease as instruct me; nor so much make me proud as they humble me,\nin comparing them. And all other choice than what comes from the express\nand immediate hand of God seems to me a choice of very little privilege.\nThe policies of the world are no less opposite upon this subject than\nthe schools, by which we may understand that fortune itself is not more\nvariable and inconstant, nor more blind and inconsiderate, than our\nreason. The things that are most unknown are most proper to be deified;\nwherefore to make gods of ourselves, as the ancients did, exceeds the\nextremest weakness of understanding. I would much rather have gone along\nwith those who adored the serpent, the dog, or the ox; forasmuch as\ntheir nature and being is less known to us, and that we have more room\nto imagine what we please of those beasts, and to attribute to them\nextraordinary faculties. But to have made gods of our own condition, of\nwhom we ought to know the imperfections; and to have attributed to\nthem desire, anger, revenge, marriages, generation, alliances, love,\njealousy, our members and bones, our fevers and pleasures, our death and\nobsequies; this must needs have proceeded from a marvellous inebriety of\nthe human understanding;\n\n\n      Qu\u00e6 procul usque adeo divino ab numine distant,\n   Inque De\u00fbm num\u00e9ro qu\u00e6 sint indigna videri;\n\n      \u201cFrom divine natures these so distant are,\n   They are unworthy of that character.\u201d\n\n\n_Formo, otates, vestitus, omatus noti sunt; genera, conjugia,\ncognationes, omniaque traducta ad similitudinem imbellitar tis\nhumano: nam et perturbatis animis inducuntur; accipimus enim deorurn\ncupiditates, cegritudines, iracundias_; \u201cTheir forms, ages, clothes,\nand ornaments are known: their descents, marriages, and kindred, and all\nadapted to the similitude of human weakness; for they are represented to\nus with anxious minds, and we read of the lusts, sickness, and anger\nof the gods;\u201d as having attributed divinity not only to faith,\nvirtue, honour, concord, liberty, victory, and piety; but also to\nvoluptuousness, fraud, death, envy, old age, misery; to fear, fever, ill\nfortune, and other injuries of our frail and transitory life:--\n\n\n      Quid juvat hoc, templis nostros inducere mores?\n   O curv\u00e6 in terris anim\u00e6 et colestium inanes!\n\n      \u201cO earth-born souls! by earth-born passions led,\n   To every spark of heav\u2019nly influence dead!\n   Think ye that what man values will inspire\n   In minds celestial the same base desire?\u201d\n\n\nThe Egyptians, with an impudent prudence, interdicted, upon pain of\nhanging, that any one should say that their gods, Serapis and Isis, had\nformerly been men; and yet no one was ignorant that they had been\nsuch; and their effigies, represented with the finger upon the mouth,\nsignified, says Varro, that mysterious decree to their priests, to\nconceal their mortal original, as it must by necessary consequence\ncancel all the veneration paid to them. Seeing that man so much desired\nto equal himself to God, he had done better, says Cicero, to have\nattracted those divine conditions to himself, and drawn them down hither\nbelow, than to send his corruption and misery up on high; but, to take\nit right, he has several ways done both the one and the other, with like\nvanity of opinion.\n\nWhen philosophers search narrowly into the hierarchy of their gods, and\nmake a great bustle about distinguishing their alliances, offices, and\npower, I cannot believe they speak as they think. When Plato describes\nPluto\u2019s orchard to us, and the bodily conveniences or pains that attend\nus after the ruin and annihilation of our bodies, and accommodates them\nto the feeling we have in this life:--\n\n\n      Secreti celant calles, et myrtea circum\n   Sylva tegit; cur\u00e6 non ips\u00e2 in morte relinquunt;\n\n      \u201cIn secret vales and myrtle groves they lie,\n   Nor do cares leave them even when they die.\u201d\n\n\nwhen Mahomet promises his followers a Paradise hung with tapestry,\ngilded and enamelled with gold and precious stones, furnished with\nwenches of excelling beauty, rare wines, and delicate dishes; it\nis easily discerned that these are deceivers that accommodate their\npromises to our sensuality, to attract and allure us by hopes and\nopinions suitable to our mortal appetites. And yet some amongst us\nare fallen into the like error, promising to themselves after the\nresurrection a terrestrial and temporal life, accompanied with all sorts\nof worldly conveniences and pleasures. Can we believe that Plato, he\nwho had such heavenly conceptions, and was so well acquainted with the\nDivinity as thence to derive the name of the Divine Plato, ever thought\nthat the poor creature, man, had any thing in him applicable to that\nincomprehensible power? and that he believed that the weak holds we are\nable to take were capable, or the force of our understanding sufficient,\nto participate of beatitude or eternal pains? We should then tell him\nfrom human reason: \u201cIf the pleasures thou dost promise us in the other\nlife are of the same kind that I have enjoyed here below, this has\nnothing in common with infinity; though all my five natural senses\nshould be even loaded with pleasure, and my soul full of all the\ncontentment it could hope or desire, we know what all this amounts to,\nall this would be nothing; if there be any thing of mine there, there is\nnothing divine; if this be no more than what may belong to our present\ncondition, it cannot be of any value. All contentment of mortals is\nmortal. Even the knowledge of our parents, children, and friends,\nif that can affect and delight us in the other world, if that still\ncontinues a satisfaction to us there, we still remain in earthly and\nfinite conveniences. We cannot as we ought conceive the greatness of\nthese high and divine promises, if we could in any sort conceive them;\nto have a worthy imagination of them we must imagine them unimaginable,\ninexplicable, and incomprehensible, and absolutely another thing than\nthose of our miserable experience.\u201d \u201cEye hath not seen,\u201d saith St. Paul,\n\u201cnor ear heard, neither hath entered into the heart of man, the things\nthat God hath prepared for them that love him.\u201d And if, to render us\ncapable, our being were reformed and changed (as thou, Plato, sayest, by\nthy purifications), it ought to be so extreme and total a change, that\nby physical doctrine it be no more us;--\n\n\n      Hector erat tunc cum bello certabat; at ille\n   Tractus ab \u00c6monio non erat Hector eqao;\n\n      He Hector was whilst he could fight, but when\n   Dragg\u2019d by Achilles\u2019 steeds, no Hector then;\n\n\nit must be something else that must receive these recompenses:--\n\n\n      Quod mutatur... dissolvitur; interit ergo;\n   Trajiciuntur enim partes, atque ordine migrant.\n\n      \u201cThings changed dissolved are, and therefore die;\n   Their parts are mix\u2019d, and from their order fly.\u201d\n\n\nFor in Pythagoras\u2019s metempsychosis, and the change of habitation that\nhe imagined in souls, can we believe that the lion, in whom the soul of\nC\u00e6sar is enclosed, does espouse C\u00e6sar\u2019s passions, or that the lion\nis he? For if it was still C\u00e6sar, they would be in the right who,\ncontroverting this opinion with Plato, reproach him that the son\nmight be seen to ride his mother transformed into a mule, and the like\nabsurdities. And can we believe that in the mutations that are made of\nthe bodies of animals into others of the same kind, the new comers are\nnot other than their predecessors? From the ashes of a phoenix, a worm,\nthey say, is engendered, and from that another phoenix; who can\nimagine that this second phoenix is no other than the first? We see our\nsilk-worms, as it were, die and wither; and from this withered body a\nbutterfly is produced; and from that another worm; how ridiculous would\nit be to imagine that this was still the first! That which once has\nceased to be is no more:--\n\n\n      Nec, si materiam nostram collegerit \u00e6tas\n   Post obitum, rursumque redegerit, ut sita nunc est,\n   Atque iterum nobis fuerint data lumina vit\u00e6,\n   Pertineat quidquam tamen ad nos id quoque factum,\n   Interrupta semel cum sit repetentia nostra.\n\n      \u201cNeither tho\u2019 time should gather and restore\n   Our matter to the form it was before,\n   And give again new light to see withal,\n   Would that new figure us concern at all;\n   Or we again ever the same be seen,\n   Our being having interrupted been.\u201d\n\n\nAnd, Plato, when thou sayest in another place that it shall be the\nspiritual part of man that will be concerned in the fruition of the\nrecompense of another life, thou tellest us a thing wherein there is as\nlittle appearance of truth:--\n\n\n      Scilicet, avolsis radicibus, ut nequit ullam\n   Dispicere ipsa oculus rem, seorsum corpore toto;\n\n      \u201cNo more than eyes once from their optics torn,\n   Can ever after any thing discern;\u201d\n\n\nfor, by this account, it would no more be man, nor consequently us,\nwho would be concerned in this enjoyment; for we are composed of two\nprincipal essential parts, the separation of which is the death and ruin\nof our being:--\n\n\n      Inter enim jecta est vital pausa, vageque\n   Deerrarunt passim motus ab sensibus omnes;\n\n      \u201cWhen once that pause of life is come between,\n   \u2018Tis just the same as we had never been;\u201d\n\n\nwe cannot say that the man suffers when the worms feed upon his members,\nand that the earth consumes them:--\n\n\n      Et nihil hoc ad nos, qui coltu conjugioque\n   Corporis atque anim\u00e6 consistimus uniter apti.\n\n      \u201cWhat\u2019s that to us? for we are only we,\n   While soul and body in one frame agree.\u201d\n\n\nMoreover, upon what foundation of their justice can the gods take notice\nof or reward man after his death and virtuous actions, since it was\nthemselves that put them in the way and mind to do them? And why should\nthey be offended at or punish him for wicked ones, since themselves have\ncreated in him so frail a condition, and when, with one glance of their\nwill, they might prevent him from falling? Might not Epicurus, with\ngreat colour of human reason, object this to Plato, did he not often\nsave himself with this sentence: \u201cThat it is impossible to establish any\nthing certain of the immortal nature by the mortal?\u201d She does nothing\nbut err throughout, but especially when she meddles with divine things.\nWho does more evidently perceive this than we? For although we have\ngiven her certain and infallible principles; and though we have\nenlightened her steps with the sacred lamp of truth that it has pleased\nGod to communicate to us; we daily see, nevertheless, that if she swerve\nnever so little from the ordinary path; and that she stray from, or\nwander out of the way set out and beaten by the church, how soon she\nloses, confounds and fetters herself, tumbling and floating in this\nvast, turbulent, and waving sea of human opinions, without restraint,\nand without any determinate end; so soon as she loses that great and\ncommon road, she enters into a labyrinth of a thousand several paths.\n\nMan cannot be any thing but what he is, nor imagine beyond the reach of\nhis capacity. \u201cTis a greater presumption,\u201d says Plutarch, \u201cin them who\nare but men to attempt to speak and discourse of the gods and demi-gods\nthan it is in a man utterly ignorant of music to give an opinion of\nsinging; or in a man who never saw a camp to dispute about arms and\nmartial affairs, presuming by some light conjecture to understand the\neffects of an art he is totally a stranger to.\u201d Antiquity, I believe,\nthought to put a compliment upon, and to add something to, the divine\ngrandeur in assimilating it to man, investing it with his faculties,\nand adorning it with his ugly humours and most shameful necessities;\noffering it our aliments to eat, presenting it with our dances,\nmummeries, and farces, to divert it; with our vestments to cover it,\nand our houses to inhabit, coaxing it with the odour of incense and the\nsounds of music, with festoons and nosegays; and to accommodate it to\nour vicious passions, flattering its justice with inhuman vengeance, and\nwith the ruin and dissipation of things by it created and preserved as\nTiberius Sempronius, who burnt the rich spoils and arms he had gained\nfrom the enemy in Sardinia for a sacrifice to Vulcan; and Paulus\n\u00c6milius, those of Macedonia, to Mars and Minerva; and Alexander,\narriving at the Indian Ocean, threw several great vessels of gold into\nthe sea, in honour of Thetes; and moreover loading her altars with\na slaughter not of innocent beasts only, but of men also, as several\nnations, and ours among the rest, were commonly used to do; and I\nbelieve there is no nation under the sun that has not done the same:--\n\n\n      Sulmone creatos\n   Quatuor h\u00eec juvenes, totidem quos educat Ufens,\n   Viventes rapit, inferias quos immolet umbris.\n\n      \u201cFour sons of Sulmo, four whom Ufens bred,\n   He took in flight, and living victims led,\n   To please the ghost of Pallas, and expire\n   In sacrifice before his fun\u2019ral pyre.\u201d\n\n\nThe Get\u00e6 hold themselves to be immortal, and that their death is nothing\nbut a journey to their god Zamolxis. Every five years they dispatch some\none among them to him, to entreat of him such necessaries as they stand\nin need of. This envoy is chosen by lot, and the form of dispatching\nhim, after he has been instructed by word of mouth what he is to\ndeliver, is that of the assistants, three hold up as many javelins, upon\nwhich the rest throw his body with all their force. If he happen to\nbe wounded in a mortal part, and that he immediately dies, \u2018tis held a\ncertain argument of divine favour; but if he escapes, he is looked upon\nas a wicked and execrable wretch, and another is dismissed after the\nsame manner in his stead. Amestris, the mother of Xerxes, being grown\nold, caused at once fourteen young men, of the best families of Persia,\nto be buried alive, according to the religion of the country, to gratify\nsome infernal deity. And even to this day the idols of Themixtitan\nare cemented with the blood of little children, and they delight in no\nsacrifice but of these pure and infantine souls; a justice thirsty of\ninnocent blood:--\n\n\n   Tantum religio potuit suadere maloram.\n\n   \u201cSuch impious use was of religion made,\n   So many demon acts it could persuade.\u201d\n\n\nThe Carthaginians immolated their own children to Saturn; and those who\nhad none of their own bought of others, the father and mother being in\nthe mean time obliged to assist at the ceremony with a gay and contented\ncountenance.\n\nIt was a strange fancy to think to gratify the divine bounty with our\nafflictions; like the Lacedemonians, who regaled their Diana with the\ntormenting of young boys, whom they caused to be whipped for her sake,\nvery often to death. It was a savage humour to imagine to gratify the\narchitect by the subversion of his building, and to think to take away\nthe punishment due to the guilty by punishing the innocent; and that\npoor Iphigenia, at the port of Aulis, should by her death and immolation\nacquit, towards God, the whole army of the Greeks from all the crimes\nthey had committed;\n\n\n      Et casta inceste, nubendi tempore in ipso,\n   Hostia concideret mactatu mosta parentis;\n\n      \u201cThat the chaste virgin in her nuptial band\n   Should die by an unnat\u2019ral father\u2019s hand;\u201d\n\n\nand that the two noble and generous souls of the two Decii, the father\nand the son, to incline the favour of the gods to be propitious to the\naffairs of Rome, should throw themselves headlong into the thickest of\nthe enemy: _Quo fuit tanta deorum iniquitas, ut placari populo Romano\nnon possent, nisi tales viri occidissent?_ \u201cHow great an injustice in\nthe gods was it that they could not be reconciled to the people of Rome\nunless such men perished!\u201d To which may be added, that it is not for the\ncriminal to cause himself to be scourged according to his own measure\nnor at his own time, but that it purely belongs to the judge, who\nconsiders nothing as chastisements but the penalty that he appoints, and\ncannot call that punishment which proceeds from the consent of him that\nsuffers. The divine vengeance presupposes an absolute dissent in us,\nboth for its justice and for our own penalty. And therefore it was a\nridiculous humour of Polycrates, tyrant of Samos, who, to interrupt the\ncontinued course of his good fortune, and to balance it, went and threw\nthe dearest and most precious jewel he had into the sea, believing\nthat by this voluntary and antedated mishap he bribed and satisfied\nthe revolution and vicissitude of fortune; and she, to mock his folly,\nordered it so that the same jewel came again into his hands, found\nin the belly of a fish. And then to what end were those tearings and\ndismemberments of the Corybantes, the Menades, and, in our times, of the\nMahometans, who slash their faces, bosoms, and limbs, to gratify their\nprophet; seeing that the offence lies in the will, not in the breast,\neyes, genitals, roundness of form, the shoulders, or the throat?\n_Tantus est perturb\u00e2to mentis, et sedibus suis pilso, furor, ut sic dii\nplacentur, quemadmodum ne homines quidem soviunt._ \u201cSo great is the\nfury and madness of troubled minds when once displaced from the seat of\nreason, as if the gods should be appeased with what even men are not so\ncruel as to approve.\u201d The use of this natural contexture has not only\nrespect to us, but also to the service of God and other men; \u2018tis as\nunjust for us voluntarily to wound or hurt it as to kill ourselves upon\nany pretence whatever; it seems to be great cowardice and treason to\nexercise cruelty upon, and to destroy, the functions of the body that\nare stupid and servile, to spare the soul the solicitude of governing\nthem according to reason: _Ubi iratos deos timent, qui sic propitios\nhabere merentur? In regi\u00e6 libidinis voluptatem castrati sunt quidam;\nsed nemo sibi, ne vir esset, jubente domino, mantis intulit._ \u201cWhere are\nthey so afraid of the anger of the gods as to merit their favour at that\nrate? Some, indeed, have been made eunuchs for the lust of princes: but\nno man at his master\u2019s command has put his own hand to unman himself.\u201d\n So did they fill their religion with several ill effects:--\n\n\n   S\u00e6pius olim Religio peperit scelerosa atque impia facta.\n\n   \u201cIn elder times Religion did commit most fearful crimes.\u201d\n\n\nNow nothing of ours can in any sort be compared or likened unto\nthe divine nature, which will not blemish and stain it with much\nimperfection.\n\nHow can that infinite beauty, power, and goodness, admit of any\ncorrespondence or similitude to such abject things as we are, without\nextreme wrong and manifest dishonour to his divine greatness? _Infirmum\ndei fortius est hominibs; et stultum dei sapientius est hominibus._ \u201cFor\nthe foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is\nstronger than men.\u201d Stilpo, the philosopher, being asked, \u201cWhether\nthe gods were delighted with our adorations and sacrifices?\u201d--\u201cYou are\nindiscreet,\u201d answered he; \u201clet us withdraw apart, if you would talk of\nsuch things.\u201d Nevertheless, we prescribe him bounds, we keep his power\nbesieged by our reasons (I call our ravings and dreams reason, with the\ndispensation of philosophy, which says, \u201cThat the wicked man, and even\nthe fool, go mad by reason, but a particular form of reason\u201d), we\nwould subject him to the vain and feeble appearances of our\nunderstandings,--him who has made both us and our knowledge. Because\nthat nothing is made of nothing, God therefore could not make the world\nwithout matter. What! has God put into our hands the keys and most\nsecret springs of his power? Is he obliged not to exceed the limits of\nour knowledge? Put the case, O man! that thou hast been able here to\nmark some footsteps of his effects; dost thou therefore think that he\nhas employed all he can, and has crowded all his forms and ideas in this\nwork? Thou seest nothing but the order and revolution of this little\ncave in which thou art lodged, if, indeed, thou dost see so much;\nwhereas his divinity has an infinite jurisdiction beyond. This part is\nnothing in comparison of the whole:--\n\n\n      Omnia cum colo, terr\u00e0que, manque,\n   Nil sunt ad summam summal totius omnem.\n\n      \u201cThe earth, the sea, and skies, from pole to pole,\n   Are small, nay, nothing to the mighty whole.\u201d\n\n\n\u2018Tis a municipal law that thou allegest, thou knowest not what is\nuniversal Tie thyself to that to which thou art subject, but not him; he\nis not of thy brotherhood, thy fellow-citizen, or companion. If he has\nin some sort communicated himself unto thee, \u2018tis not to debase himself\nunto thy littleness, nor to make thee comptroller of his power; the\nhuman body cannot fly to the clouds; rules are for thee. The sun runs\nevery day his ordinary course; the bounds of the sea and the earth\ncannot be confounded; the water is unstable and without firmness; a\nwall, unless it be broken, is impenetrable to a solid body; a man cannot\npreserve his life in the flames; he cannot be both in heaven and upon\nearth, and corporally in a thousand places at once. \u2018Tis for thee that\nhe has made these rules; \u2018tis thee that they concern; he has manifested\nto Christians that he has enfranchised himself from them all when it\npleased him. And, in truth, why, almighty as he is, should he have\nlimited his power within any certain bounds? In favour of whom should he\nhave renounced his privilege? Thy reason has in no other thing more of\nlikelihood and foundation than in that wherein it persuades thee that\nthere is a plurality of worlds:--\n\n\n      Terramque et solem, lunam, mare, estera quo rant,\n   Non esse unica, sed num\u00e9ro magis innumerali.\n\n      \u201cThat earth, sun, moon, sea, and the rest that are,\n   Not single, but innumerable were.\u201d\n\n\nThe most eminent minds of elder times believed it; and some of this\nage of ours, compelled by the appearances of human reason, do the same;\nforasmuch as in this fabric that we behold there is nothing single and\none,\n\n\n      Cum in summ\u00e0 res nulla sit una,\n   Unica quo gignatur, et unica solaque crescat;\n\n      \u201cSince nothing\u2019s single in this mighty place,\n   That can alone beget, alone increase;\u201d\n\n\nand that all the kinds are multiplied in some number; by which it seems\nnot to be likely that God should have made this work only without a\ncompanion; and that the matter of this form should have been totally\ndrained in this individual.\n\n\n      Quare etiam atque etiam tales fateare necesse est\n   Esse alios alibi congressus materiali;\n   Qualis hic est, avido complexu quem tenet \u00e6ther.\n\n      \u201cWherefore \u2018tis necessary to confess\n   That there must elsewhere be the like congress\n   Of the like matter, which the airy space\n   Holds fast within its infinite embrace.\u201d\n\n\nEspecially if it be a living creature, which its motions render so\ncredible that Plato affirms it, and that many of our people do either\nconfirm, or dare not deny it; no more than that ancient opinion that\nthe heavens, the stars, and other members of the world, are creatures\ncomposed of body and soul, mortal in respect of their composition,\nbut immortal by the determination of the Creator. Now if there be many\nworlds, as Democritus, Epicurus, and almost all philosophy has believed,\nwhat do we know that the principles and rules of this of ours in like\nmanner concern the rest? They may peradventure have another form and\nanother polity. Epicurus supposes them either like or unlike. We see\nin this world an infinite difference and variety, only by distance of\nplaces; neither com, wine, nor any of our animals are to be seen in that\nnew comer of the world discovered by our fathers; \u2018tis all there another\nthing; and in times past, do but consider in how many parts of the world\nthey had no knowledge either of Bacchus or Ceres. If Pliny and Herodotus\nare to be believed, there are in certain places kinds of men very little\nresembling us, mongrel and ambiguous forms, betwixt the human and brutal\nnatures; there are countries where men are bom without heads, having\ntheir mouth and eyes in their breast; where they are all hermaphrodites;\nwhere they go on all four; where they have but one eye in the forehead,\nand a head more like a dog than like ours; where they are half fish the\nlower part, and live in the water; where the women bear at five years\nold, and live but eight; where the head and the skin of the forehead is\nso hard that a sword will not touch it, but rebounds again; where men\nhave no beards; nations that know not the use of fire; others that eject\nseed of a black colour. What shall we say of those that naturally change\nthemselves into wolves, colts, and then into men again? And if it be\ntrue, as Plutarch says, that in some place of the Indies there are men\nwithout mouths, who nourish themselves with the smell of certain odours,\nhow many of our descriptions are false? He is no longer risible, nor,\nperhaps, capable of reason and society. The disposition and cause of our\ninternal composition would then for the most part be to no purpose, and\nof no use.\n\nMoreover, how many things are there in our own knowledge that oppose\nthose fine rules we have cut out for and prescribe to nature? And yet we\nmust undertake to circumscribe thereto God himself! How many things do\nwe call miraculous, and contrary to nature? This is done by every nation\nand by every man, according to the proportion of his ignorance. How many\noccult properties and quintessences do we daily discover? For, for us\nto go \u201caccording to nature,\u201d is no more but to go \u201caccording to our\nunderstanding,\u201d as far as that is able to follow, and as far as we\nare able to see into it; all beyond that is, forsooth, monstrous and\nirregular. Now, by this account, all things shall be monstrous to the\nwisest and most understanding men; for human reason has persuaded them\nthat there was no manner of ground nor foundation, not so much as to be\nassured that snow is white, and Anaxagoras affirmed it to be black; if\nthere be any thing, or if there be nothing; if there be knowledge\nor ignorance, which Metrodorus of Chios denied that man was able to\ndetermine; or whether we live, as Euripides doubts whether the life we\nlive is life, or whether that we call death be not life, [--Greek--]\nand not without some appearance. For why do we derive the title of being\nfrom this instant, which is but a flash in the infinite course of an\neternal night, and so short an interruption of our perpetual and natural\ncondition, death possessing all the before and after this moment, and\nalso a good part of the moment itself. Others swear there is no motion\nat all, as followers of Melissus, and that nothing stirs. For if there\nbe but one, neither can that spherical motion be of any use to him,\nnor motion from one place to another, as Plato proves: \u201cThat there is\nneither generation nor corruption in nature.\u201d Protagoras says that there\nis nothing in nature but doubt; that a man may equally dispute of all\nthings; and even of this, whether a man can equally dispute of all\nthings; Nausiphanes, that of things which seem to be, nothing is\nmore than it is not; that there is nothing certain but uncertainty;\nParmenides, that of that which seems, there is no one thing in general;\nthat there is but one thing; Zeno, that one same is not, and that there\nis nothing; if there were one thing, it would either be in another or in\nitself; if it be in another, they are two; if it be in itself, they are\nyet two; the comprehending, and the comprehended. According to these\ndoctrines the nature of things is no other than a shadow, either false\nor vain.\n\nThis way of speaking in a Christian man has ever seemed to me very\nindiscreet and irreverent. \u201cGod cannot die; God cannot contradict\nhimself; God cannot do this or that.\u201d I do not like to have the divine\npower so limited by the laws of men\u2019s mouths; and the idea which\npresents itself to us in those propositions ought to be more religiously\nand reverently expressed.\n\nOur speaking has its failings and defects, as well as all the rest. Most\nof the occasions of disturbance in the world are grammatical ones; our\nsuits only spring from disputes as to the interpretation of laws; and\nmost wars proceed from the inability of ministers clearly to express the\nconventions and treaties of amity of princes. How many quarrels, and\nof how great importance, has the doubt of the meaning of this syllable,\n_hoc_,* created in the world? Let us take the clearest conclusion that\nlogic itself\n\n\n   * Montaigne here refers to the controversies between\n     the Catholics and Protestants about transubstantiation.\n\n\npresents us withal; if you say, \u201cIt is fine weather,\u201d and that you\nsay true, it is then fine weather. Is not this a very certain form of\nspeaking? And yet it will deceive us; that it will do so, let us follow\nthe example: If you say, \u201cI lie,\u201d if you say true, you do lie. The art,\nthe reason, and force of the conclusion of this, are the same with the\nother, and yet we are gravelled. The Pyrrhonian philosophers, I see,\ncannot express their general conception in any kind of speaking; for\nthey would require a new language on purpose; ours is all formed of\naffirmative propositions, which are totally antarctic to them; insomuch\nthat when they say \u201cI doubt,\u201d they are presently taken by the throat, to\nmake them confess that at least they know and are assured that they do\ndoubt. By which means they have been compelled to shelter themselves\nunder this medical comparison, without which their humour would be\ninexplicable: when they pronounce, \u201cI know not,\u201d or, \u201cI doubt,\u201d they say\nthat this proposition carries off itself with the rest, no more nor less\nthan rhubarb, that drives out the ill humours, and carries itself\noff with them. This fancy will be more certainly understood by\ninterrogation: \u201cWhat do I know?\u201d as I bear it with the emblem of a\nbalance.\n\nSee what use they make of this irreverent way of speaking; in the\npresent disputes about our religion, if you press its adversaries too\nhard, they will roundly tell you, \u201cthat it is not in the power of God to\nmake it so, that his body should be in paradise and upon earth, and in\nseveral places at once.\u201d And see, too, what advantage the old scoffer\nmade of this. \u201cAt least,\u201d says he, \u201cit is no little consolation to man\nto see that God cannot do all things; for he cannot kill himself, though\nhe would; which is the greatest privilege we have in our condition; he\ncannot make mortal immortal, nor revive the dead; nor make it so, that\nhe who has lived has not; nor that he who has had honours has not had\nthem; having no other right to the past than that of oblivion.\u201d And that\nthe comparison of man to God may yet be made out by jocose examples: \u201cHe\ncannot order it so,\u201d says he, \u201cthat twice ten shall not be twenty.\u201d\n This is what he says, and what a Christian ought to take heed shall not\nescape his lips. Whereas, on the contrary, it seems as if men studied\nthis foolish daring of language, to reduce God to their own measure:--\n\n\n      Cras vel atr\u00e2 Nube polum, Pater, occupato,\n   Vel sole puro; non tamen irritum\n   Quodcumque retro est efficiet, neque\n   Diffinget infectumque reddet\n   Quod fugiens semel hora vexit.\n\n      \u201cTo-morrow, let it shine or rain,\n   Yet cannot this the past make vain:\n   Nor uncreate and render void\n   That which was yesterday enjoyed.\u201d\n\n\nWhen we say that the infinity of ages, as well past as to come, are but\none instant with God; that his goodness, wisdom, and power are the same\nwith his essence; our mouths speak it, but our understandings apprehend\nit not; and yet, such is our vain opinion of ourselves, that we must\nmake the Divinity to pass through our sieve; and thence proceed all the\ndreams and errors with which the world abounds, whilst we reduce and\nweigh in our balance a thing so far above our poise. _Mirum quo proc\u00e9dat\nimprobitas cordis humani, parvulo aliquo intritata successu._ \u201c\u2018Tis\nwonderful to what the wickedness of man\u2019s heart will proceed, if\nelevated with the least success.\u201d How magisterially and insolently does\nEpicurus reprove the Stoics, for maintaining that the truly good and\nhappy being appertained only to God, and that the wise man had nothing\nbut a shadow and resemblance of it! How temerariously have they bound\nGod to destiny (a thing which, by my consent, none that bears the name\nof a Christian shall ever do again)! and Thales, Plato, and Pythagoras\nhave enslaved him to necessity. This arrogance of attempting to discover\nGod with our eyes has been the cause that an eminent person among us has\nattributed to the Divinity a corporal form; and is the reason of what\nhappens to us every day, of attributing to God important events, by a\nparticular assignment. Because they weigh with us, they conclude that\nthey also weigh with him, and that he has a more intent and vigilant\nregard to them than to others of less moment to us or of ordinary\ncourse: _Magna Dii curant, parva negligunt:_ \u201cThe gods are concerned at\ngreat matters, but slight the small.\u201d Listen to him; he will clear this\nto you by his reason: _Nec in regnis quidem reges omnia minima curant:_\n\u201cNeither indeed do kings in their administration take notice of all the\nleast concerns.\u201d As if to that King of kings it were more or less\nto subvert a kingdom, or to move the leaf of a tree; or as if his\nprovidence acted after another manner in inclining the event of a battle\nthan in the leap of a flea. The hand of his government is laid upon\nevery thing after the same manner, with the same power and order; our\ninterest does nothing towards it; our inclinations and measures sway\nnothing with him. _Deus ita artifex magnus in magnis, ut minor non sit\nin parvis:_ \u201cGod is so great an artificer in great things, that he is no\nless in the least\u201d Our arrogancy sets this blasphemous comparison\never before us. Because our employments are a burden to us, Strato has\ncourteously been pleased to exempt the gods from all offices, as their\npriests are; he makes nature produce and support all things; and\nwith her weights and motions make up the several parts of the world,\ndischarging human nature from the awe of divine judgments: _Quod beatum\n\u00e6terumque sit, id nec habere negotii quicquam, nec exhibere alteri:_\n\u201cWhat is blessed and eternal has neither any business itself nor gives\nany to another.\u201d Nature will that in like things there should be a like\nrelation. The infinite number of mortals, therefore, concludes a\nlike number of immortals; the infinite things that kill and destroy\npresupposes as many that preserve and profit. As the souls of the\ngods, without tongue, eye, or ear, do every one of them feel amongst\nthemselves what the other feels, and judge our thoughts; so the souls of\nmen, when at liberty and loosed from the body, either by sleep or some\necstacy, divine, foretell, and see things, which, whilst joined to the\nbody, they could not see. \u201cMen,\u201d says St. Paul, \u201cprofessing themselves\nto be wise, they become fools; and change the glory of the uncorruptible\nGod into an image made like corruptible man.\u201d Do but take notice of the\njuggling in the ancient deifications. After the great and stately pomp\nof the funeral, so soon as the fire began to mount to the top of the\npyramid, and to catch hold of the couch where the body lay, they at the\nsame time turned out an eagle, which flying upward, signified that the\nsoul went into Paradise. We have a thousand medals, and particularly\nof the worthy Faustina, where this eagle is represented carrying these\ndeified souls to heaven with their heels upwards. \u2018Tis pity that we\nshould fool ourselves with our own fopperies and inventions,\n\n\n   Quod finxere, timent,\n\n   \u201cThey fear their own inventions,\u201d\n\n\nlike children who are frighted with the same face of their playfellow,\nthat they themselves have smeared and smutted. _Quasi quicquam\ninfelicius sit homine, cui sua figmenta dominantur:_\n\n\u201cAs if any thing could be more unhappy than man, who is insulted over by\nhis own imagination.\u201d \u2018Tis far from honouring him who made us, to honour\nhim that we have made. Augustus had more temples than Jupiter, served\nwith as much religion and belief of miracles. The Thracians, in return\nof the benefits they had received from Agesilaus, came to bring him word\nthat they had canonized him: \u201cHas your nation,\u201d said he to them, \u201cthe\npower to make gods of whom they please? Pray first deify some one\namongst yourselves, and when I shall see what advantage he has by it,\nI will thank you for your offer.\u201d Man is certainly stark mad; he cannot\nmake a worm, and yet he will be making gods by dozens. Hear Trismegistus\nin praise of our sufficiency: \u201cOf all the wonderful things, it surmounts\nall wonder that man could find out the divine nature and make it.\u201d And\ntake here the arguments of the school of philosophy itself:--\n\n\n      Nosse cui divos et coli munina soli,\n   Aut soli nescire, datum.\n\n      \u201cTo whom to know the deities of heaven,\n   Or know he knows them not, alone \u2018tis given.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIf there is a God, he is a living creature; if he be a living creature,\nhe has sense; and if he has sense, he is subject to corruption. If he\nbe without a body he is without a soul, and consequently without action;\nand if he has a body, it is perishable.\u201d Is not here a triumph? we\nare incapable of having made the world; there must then be some more\nexcellent nature that has put a hand to the work. It were a foolish and\nridiculous arrogance to esteem ourselves the most perfect thing of the\nuniverse. There must then be something that is better, and that must be\nGod. When you see a stately and stupendous edifice, though you do not\nknow who is the owner of it, you would yet conclude it was not built for\nrats. And this divine structure, that we behold of the celestial\npalace, have we not reason to believe that it is the residence of some\npossessor, who is much greater than we? Is not the most supreme always\nthe most worthy? but we are in the lowest form. Nothing without a soul\nand without reason can produce a living creature capable of reason. The\nworld produces us, the world then has soul and reason. Every part of us\nis less than we. We are part of the world, the world therefore is endued\nwith wisdom and reason, and that more abundantly than we. \u2018Tis a fine\nthing to have a great government; the government of the world then\nappertains to some happy nature. The stars do us no harm; they are then\nfull of goodness. We have need of nourishment; then so have the gods\nalso, and feed upon the vapours of the earth. Worldly goods are not\ngoods to God; therefore they are not goods to us; offending and being\noffended are equally testimonies of imbecility; \u2018tis therefore folly to\nfear God. God is good by his nature; man by his industry, which is more.\nThe divine and human wisdom have no other distinction, but that the\nfirst is eternal; but duration is no accession to wisdom, therefore we\nare companions. We have life, reason, and liberty; we esteem goodness,\ncharity, and justice; these qualities are then in him. In conclusion,\nbuilding and destroying, the conditions of the Divinity, are forged by\nman, according as they relate to himself. What a pattern, and what a\nmodel! let us stretch, let us raise and swell human qualities as much as\nwe please; puff up thyself, poor man, yet more and more, and more:--\n\n\n   Non, si tu ruperis, inquit.\n\n   \u201cNot if thou burst,\u201d said he.\n\n\n_Profecto non Deum, quern cogitare non possunt, sed semetip pro illo\ncogitantes, non ilium, sed seipsos, non illi, sed sibi comparant?_\n\u201cCertainly they do not imagine God, whom they cannot imagine; but\nthey imagine themselves in his stead; they do not compare him, but\nthemselves, not to him, but to themselves.\u201d In natural things the\neffects do but half relate to their causes. What\u2019s this to the purpose?\nHis condition is above the order of nature, too elevated, too remote,\nand too mighty, to permit itself to be bound and fettered by our\nconclusions. \u2018Tis not through ourselves that we arrive at that place;\nour ways lie too low. We are no nearer heaven on the top of Mount Cenis\nthan at the bottom of the sea; take the distance with your astrolabe.\nThey debase God even to the carnal knowledge of women, to so many times,\nand so many generations. Paulina, the wife of Satuminus, a matron of\ngreat reputation at Rome, thinking she lay with the god Serapis, found\nherself in the arms of an amoroso of hers, through the panderism of the\npriests of his temple. Varro, the most subtle and most learned of all\nthe Latin authors, in his book of theology, writes, that the sexton of\nHercules\u2019s temple, throwing dice with one hand for himself, and with the\nother for Hercules, played after that manner with him for a supper and\na wench; if he won, at the expense of the offerings; if he lost, at his\nown. The sexton lost, and paid the supper and the wench. Her name was\nLaurentina, who saw by night this god in her arms, who moreover told\nher, that the first she met the next day, should give her a heavenly\nreward; which proved to be Taruncius, a rich young man, who took her\nhome to his house, and in time left her his inheritrix. She, in her\nturn, thinking to do a thing that would be pleasing to the god, left the\npeople of Rome heirs to her; and therefore had divine honours attributed\nto her. As if it had not been sufficient that Plato was originally\ndescended from the gods by a double line, and that he had Neptune for\nthe common father of his race, it was certainly believed at Athens, that\nAristo, having a mind to enjoy the fair Perictione, could not, and\nwas warned by the god Apollo, in a dream, to leave her unpolluted and\nuntouched, till she should first be brought to bed. These were the\nfather and mother of Plato. How many ridiculous stories are there of\nlike cuckoldings, committed by the gods against poor mortal men! And how\nmany husbands injuriously scandaled in favour of the children! In the\nMahometan religion there are Merlins enough found by the belief of the\npeople; that is to say, children without fathers, spiritual, divinely\nconceived in the wombs of virgins, and carry names that signify so much\nin their language.\n\nWe are to observe that to every thing nothing is more dear and estimable\nthan its being (the lion, the eagle the dolphin, prize nothing above\ntheir own kind); and that every thing assimilates the qualities of all\nother things to its own proper qualities, which we may indeed extend\nor contract, but that\u2019s all; for beyond that relation and principle our\nimagination cannot go, can guess at nothing else, nor possibly go out\nthence, nor stretch beyond it; whence spring these ancient conclusions:\nof all forms the most beautiful is that of man; therefore God must be\nof that form. No one can be happy without virtue, nor virtue be without\nreason, and reason cannot inhabit anywhere but in a human shape; God is\ntherefore clothed in a human figure. _Ita est informatum et anticipatum\nmentibus nostris, ut homini, quum de Deo cogitet, forma occurrat\nhu-mana._ \u201cIt is so imprinted in our minds, and the fancy is so\nprepossessed with it, that when a man thinks of God, a human figure ever\npresents itself to the imagination.\u201d Therefore it was that Xenophanes\npleasantly said, \u201cThat if beasts frame any gods to themselves, as \u2018tis\nlikely they do, they make them certainly such as themselves are, and\nglorify themselves in it, as we do. For why may not a goose say thus;\n\u201cAll the parts of the universe I have an interest in; the earth serves\nme to walk upon; the sun to light me; the stars have their influence\nupon me; I have such an advantage by the winds and such by the waters;\nthere is nothing that yon heavenly roof looks upon so favourably as me;\nI am the darling of nature! Is it not man that keeps, lodges, and serves\nme? \u2018Tis for me that he both sows and grinds; if he eats me he does the\nsame by his fellow-men, and so do I the worms that kill and devour him.\u201d\n As much might be said by a crane, and with greater confidence, upon the\naccount of the liberty of his flight, and the possession of that high\nand beautiful region. _Tam blanda conciliatrix, et tam sui est lena ipsa\nnatura._ \u201cSo flattering and wheedling a bawd is nature to herself.\u201d\n\nNow by the same consequence, the destinies are then for us; for us the\nworld; it shines it thunders for us; creator and creatures, all are for\nus; \u2018tis the mark and point to which the universality of things aims.\nLook into the records that philosophy has kept for two thousand years\nand more, of the affairs of heaven; the gods all that while have\nneither acted nor spoken but for man. She does not allow them any other\nconsultation or occupation. See them here against us in war:--\n\n\n      Domitosque Hercule\u00e2 manu\n   Telluris juvenes, unde periculum\n   Fulgens contre mu it domus\n   Saturai veteris.\n\n      \u201cThe brawny sons of earth, subdu\u2019d by hand\n   Of Hercules on the Phlegr\u00e6an strand,\n   Where the rude shock did such an uproar make,\n   As made old Saturn\u2019s sparkling palace shake.\u201d\n\n\nAnd here you shall see them participate of our troubles, to make a\nreturn for our having so often shared in theirs:--\n\n\n      Neptunus muros, magnoque emota tridenti\n   Fundamenta quatit, totamque \u00e0 sedibus urbem\n   Emit: hie Juno Sc\u00e6as s\u00e6vissima portas Prima tenet.\n\n      \u201cAmidst that smother Neptune holds his place,\n   Below the walls\u2019 foundation drives his mace,\n   And heaves the city from its solid base.\n   See where in arms the cruel Juno stands,\n   Full in the Sc\u00e6an gate.\u201d\n\n\nThe Caunians, jealous of the authority of their own proper gods, armed\nthemselves on the days of their devotion, and through the whole of their\nprecincts ran cutting and slashing the air with their swords, by that\nmeans to drive away and banish all foreign gods out of their territory.\nTheir powers are limited according that the plague, that the scurf, that\nthe phthisic; one cures one sort of itch, another another: _Adeo minimis\netiam rebus prava religio inserit Deos?_ \u201cAt such a rate does false\nreligion create gods for the most contemptible uses.\u201d This one makes\ngrapes grow, that onions; this has the presidence over lechery, that\nover merchandise; for every sort of artisan a god; this has his province\nand reputation in the east; that his in the west:--\n\n\n     \u201cHere lay her armour, here her chariot stood.\u201d\n\n     O sancte Apollo, qui umbilicum certum terrarum obtines!\n\n     \u201cO sacred Phoebus, who with glorious ray,\n  From the earth\u2019s centre, dost thy light display.\u201d\n\n     Pallada Cecropid\u00e6, Minola Creta Dianam,\n  Vulcanum tellus Hypsipylea colit,\n  Junonem Sparte, Pelopeladesque Mycen\u00e6;\n  Pinigerum Fauni M\u00e6nalis ora caput;\n  Mars Latio venerandus.\n\n     \u201cTh\u2019 Athenians Pallas, Cynthia Crete adore,\n  Vulcan is worshipped on the Lemnian shore.\n  Proud Juno\u2019s altars are by Spartans fed,\n  Th\u2019 Arcadians worship Faunus, and \u2018tis said\n  To Mars, by Italy, is homage paid.\u201d\n\n\nto our necessity; this cures horses, that men,\n\n\n   Hic illius arma, Hic currus fuit.\n\n\nThis has only one town or family in his possession; that lives alone;\nthat in company, either voluntary or upon necessity:--\n\n\n      Junctaque sunt magno templa nepotis avo.\n\n      \u201cAnd temples to the nephew joined are,\n   To those were reared to the great-grandfather.\u201d\n\n\nIn here are some so wretched and mean (for the number amounts to six and\nthirty thousand) that they must pack five or six together, to produce\none ear of corn, and thence take their several names; three to a\ndoor--that of the plank, that of the hinge, and that of the threshold.\nFour to a child--protectors of his swathing-clouts, his drink, meat, and\nsucking. Some certain, some uncertain and doubtful, and some that are\nnot yet entered Paradise:--\n\n\n      Quos, quoniam coli nondum dignamur honore,\n   Quas dedimus cert\u00e8 terras habitare sinanras:\n\n      \u201cWhom, since we yet not worthy think of heaven,\n   We suffer to possess the earth we\u2019ve given.\u201d\n\n\nThere are amongst them physicians, poets, and civilians. Some of a\nmean betwixt the divine and human nature; mediators betwixt God and us,\nadorned with a certain second and diminutive sort of adoration; infinite\nin titles and offices; some good; others ill; some old and decrepit,\nand some that are mortal. For Chrysippus was of opinion that in the last\nconflagration of the world all the gods were to die but Jupiter. Man\nmakes a thousand pretty societies betwixt God and him; is he not his\ncountryman?\n\n\n   Jovis incunabula Creten.\n\n   \u201cCrete, the cradle of Jupiter.\u201d\n\n\nAnd this is the excuse that, upon consideration of this subject,\nSc\u00e6vola, a high priest, and Varro, a great theologian in their times,\nmake us: \u201cThat it is necessary that the people should be ignorant of\nmany things that are true, and believe many things that are false.\u201d\n _Quum veritatem qua liberetur inquirat credatur ei expedire quod\nfallitur._ \u201cSeeing he inquires into the truth, by which he would be\nmade free, \u2018tis fit he should be deceived.\u201d Human eyes cannot perceive\nthings but by the forms they know; and we do not remember what a leap\nmiserable Ph\u00e6ton took for attempting to guide his father\u2019s horses with\na mortal hand. The mind of man falls into as great a depth, and is after\nthe same manner bruised and shattered by his own rashness. If you ask of\nphilosophy of what matter the heavens and the sun are? what answer will\nshe return, if not that it is iron, or, with Anaxagoras, stone, or some\nother matter that she makes use of? If a man inquire of Zeno what nature\nis? \u201cA fire,\u201d says he, \u201can artisan, proper for generation, and regularly\nproceeding.\u201d Archimedes, master of that science which attributes to\nitself the precedency before all others for truth and certainty;\n\u201cthe sun,\u201d says he, \u201cis a god of red-hot iron.\u201d Was not this a fine\nimagination, extracted from the inevitable necessity of geometrical\ndemonstrations? Yet not so inevitable and useful but that Socrates\nthought it was enough to know so much of geometry only as to measure the\nland a man bought or sold; and that Poly\u00e6nus, who had been a great\nand famous doctor in it, despised it, as full of falsity and manifest\nvanity, after he had once tasted the delicate fruits of the lozelly\ngardens of Epicurus. Socrates in Xenophon, concerning this affair,\nsays of Anaxagoras, reputed by antiquity learned above all others in\ncelestial and divine matters, \u201cThat he had cracked his brain, as all\nother men do who too immoderately search into knowledges which nothing\nbelong to them:\u201d when he made the sun to be a burning stone, he did not\nconsider that a stone does not shine in the fire; and, which is worse,\nthat it will there consume; and in making the sun and fire one, that\nfire does not turn the complexions black in shining upon them; that\nwe are able to look fixedly upon fire; and that fire kills herbs and\nplants. \u2018Tis Socrates\u2019s opinion, and mine too, that the best judging\nof heaven is not to judge of it at all. Plato having occasion, in his\n_Timous_, to speak of the demons, \u201cThis undertaking,\u201d says he, \u201cexceeds\nmy ability.\u201d We are therefore to believe those ancients who said they\nwere begotten by them; \u2018tis against all reason to refuse a man\u2019s faith\nto the children of the gods, though what they say should not be proved\nby any necessary or probable reasons; seeing they engage to speak of\ndomestic and familiar things.\n\nLet us see if we have a little more light in the knowledge of human and\nnatural things. Is it not a ridiculous attempt for us to forge for those\nto whom, by our own confession, our knowledge is not able to attain,\nanother body, and to lend a false form of our own invention; as is\nmanifest in this motion of the planets; to which, seeing our wits\ncannot possibly arrive, nor conceive their natural conduct, we lend them\nmaterial, heavy, and substantial springs of our own by which to move:--\n\n\n      Temo aureus, aurea summ\u00e6\n   Curvatura rot\u00e6, radiorum argenteus ordo.\n\n      \u201cGold was the axle, and the beam was gold;\n   The wheels with silver spokes on golden circles roll\u2019d.\u201d\n\n\nYou would say that we had had coachmakers, carpenters, and painters,\nthat went up on high to make engines of various motions, and to range\nthe wheelwork and interfacings of the heavenly bodies of differing\ncolours about the axis of necessity, according to Plato:--\n\n\n      Mundus domus est maxima rerum,\n   Quam quinque altiton\u00e6 fragmine zon\u00e6\n   Cingunt, per quam limbus pictus bis sex signis\n   Stellimicantibus, altus in obliquo \u00e6there, lun\u00e6\n   Bigas acceptat.\n\n      \u201cThe world\u2019s a mansion that doth all things hold,\n   Which thundering zones, in number five, enfold,\n   Through which a girdle, painted with twelve signs,\n   And that with sparkling constellations, shines,\n   In heaven\u2019s arch marks the diurnal course\n   For the sun\u2019s chariot and his fiery horse.\u201d\n\n\nThese are all dreams and fanatic follies. Why will not nature please for\nonce to lay open her bosom to us, and plainly discover to us the means\nand conduct of her movements, and prepare our eyes to see them? Good\nGod, what abuse, what mistakes should we discover in our poor science!\nI am mistaken if that weak knowledge of ours holds any one thing as it\nreally is, and I shall depart hence more ignorant of all other things\nthan my own ignorance.\n\nHave I not read in Plato this divine saying, that \u201cnature is nothing\nbut enigmatic poesy!\u201d As if a man might perhaps see a veiled and shady\npicture, breaking out here and there with an infinite variety of false\nlights to puzzle our conjectures: _Latent ista omnia crassis occullata\net circumfusa tenebris; ut nulla acies humani ingenii tanta sit, qu\u00e6\npenetrare in coelum, terram intrare, possit._ \u201cAll those things lie\nconcealed and involved in so dark an obscurity that no point of human\nwit can be so sharp as to pierce heaven or penetrate the earth.\u201d And\ncertainly philosophy is no other than sophisticated poetry. Whence do\nthe ancient writers extract their authorities but from the poets? and\nthe first of them were poets themselves, and writ accordingly. Plato is\nbut a poet unripped. Timon calls him, insultingly, \u201ca monstrous forger\nof miracles.\u201d All superhuman sciences make use of the poetic style. Just\nas women make use of teeth of ivory where the natural are wanting, and\ninstead of their true complexion make one of some artificial matter; as\nthey stuff themselves out with cotton to appear plump, and in the sight\nof every one do paint, patch, and trick up themselves with a false and\nborrowed beauty; so does science (and even our law itself has, they say,\nlegitimate fictions, whereon it builds the truth of its justice);\nshe gives us in presupposition, and for current pay, things which she\nherself informs us were invented; for these _epicycles, eccentrics, and\nconcentrics_, which astrology makes use of to carry on the motions of\nthe stars, she gives us for the best she could invent upon that subject;\nas also, in all the rest, philosophy presents us not that which really\nis, or what she really believes, but what she has contrived with the\ngreatest and most plausible likelihood of truth, and the quaintest\ninvention. Plato, upon the discourse of the state of human bodies and\nthose of beasts, says, \u201cI should know that what I have said is truth,\nhad I the confirmation of an oracle; but this I will affirm, that what I\nhave said is the most likely to be true of any thing I could say.\u201d\n\n\u2018Tis not to heaven only that art sends her ropes, engines, and wheels;\nlet us consider a little what she says of us ourselves, and of our\ncontexture.\n\nThere is not more retrogradation, trepidation, accession, recession, and\nastonishment, in the stars and celestial bodies, than they have found\nout in this poor little human body. In earnest, they have good reason,\nupon that very account, to call it the little world, so many tools and\nparts have they employed to erect and build it. To assist the motions\nthey see in man, and the various functions that we find in ourselves, in\nhow many parts have they divided the soul, in how many places lodged it?\nin how many orders have they divided, and to how many stories have they\nraised this poor creature, man, besides those that are natural and to\nbe perceived? And how many offices and vocations have they assigned him?\nThey make it an imaginary public thing. \u2018Tis a subject that they hold\nand handle; and they have full power granted to them to rip, place,\ndisplace, piece, and stuff it, every one according to his own fancy, and\nyet they possess it not They cannot, not in reality only, but even in\ndreams, so govern it that there will not be some cadence or sound that\nwill escape their architecture, as enormous as it is, and botched with\na thousand false and fantastic patches. And it is not reason to excuse\nthem; for though we are satisfied with painters when they paint heaven,\nearth, seas, mountains, and remote islands, that they give us some\nslight mark of them, and, as of things unknown, are content with a faint\nand obscure description; yet when they come and draw us after life, or\nany other creature which is known and familiar to us, we then require of\nthem a perfect and exact representation of lineaments and colours, and\ndespise them if they fail in it.\n\nI am very well pleased with the Milesian girl, who observing the\nphilosopher Thales to be always contemplating the celestial arch, and\nto have his eyes ever gazing upward, laid something in his way that he\nmight stumble over, to put him in mind that it would be time to take up\nhis thoughts about things that are in the clouds when he had provided\nfor those that were under his feet. Doubtless she advised him well,\nrather to look to himself than to gaze at heaven; for, as Democritus\nsays, by the mouth of Cicero,--\n\n\n   Quod est ante pedes, nemo spectat: coeli scrutantur plagas.\n\n      \u201cNo man regards what is under his feet;\n   They are always prying towards heaven.\u201d\n\n\nBut our condition will have it so, that the knowledge of what we have in\nhand is as remote from us, and as much above the clouds, as that of the\nstars. As Socrates says, in Plato, \u201cThat whoever meddles with philosophy\nmay be reproached as Thales was by the woman, that he sees nothing of\nthat which is before him. For every philosopher is ignorant of what his\nneighbour does; aye, and of what he does himself, and is ignorant of\nwhat they both are, whether beasts or men.\u201d\n\nThose people, who find Sebond\u2019s arguments too weak, that are ignorant of\nnothing, that govern the world, that know all,--\n\n\n      Qu\u00e6 mare compescant caus\u00e6; quid temperet annum;\n   Stell\u00e6 sponte su\u00e2, juss\u00e6ve, vagentur et errent;\n   Quid premat obscurum lun\u00e6, quid prof\u00e9r\u00e2t orbem;\n   Quid velit et posait rerum concordia discors;\n\n      \u201cWhat governs ocean\u2019s tides,\n   And through the various year the seasons guides;\n   Whether the stars by their own proper force,\n   Or foreign power, pursue their wand\u2019ring course;\n   Why shadows darken the pale queen of night;\n   Whence she renews her orb and spreads her light;--\n   What nature\u2019s jarring sympathy can mean;\u201d\n\n\nhave they not sometimes in their writings sounded the difficulties they\nhave met with of knowing their own being? We see very well that the\nfinger moves, that the foot moves, that some parts assume a voluntary\nmotion of themselves without our consent, and that others work by our\ndirection; that one sort of apprehension occasions blushing; another\npaleness; such an imagination works upon the spleen only, another upon\nthe brain; one occasions laughter, another tears; another stupefies and\nastonishes all our senses, and arrests the motion of all our members;\nat one object the stomach will rise, at another a member that lies\nsomething lower; but how a spiritual impression should make such a\nbreach into a massy and solid subject, and the nature of the connection\nand contexture of these admirable springs and movements, never yet\nman knew: _Omnia incerta ratione, et in natur\u00e6 majestate abdita._ \u201cAll\nuncertain in reason, and concealed in the majesty of nature,\u201d says\nPliny. And St Augustin, _Modus quo corporibus adhorent spiritus....\nomnino minis est, nec comprehendi ab homine potest; et hoc ipse\nhomo est,_ \u201cThe manner whereby souls adhere to bodies is altogether\nwonderful, and cannot be conceived by man, and yet this is man.\u201d And\nyet it is not so much as doubted; for the opinions of men are received\naccording to the ancient belief, by authority and upon trust, as if\nit were religion and law. \u2018Tis received as gibberish which is commonly\nspoken; this truth, with all its clutter of arguments and proofs, is\nadmitted as a firm and solid body, that is no more to be shaken, no more\nto be judged of; on the contrary, every one, according to the best of\nhis talent, corroborates and fortifies this received belief with the\nutmost power of his reason, which is a supple utensil, pliable, and to\nbe accommodated to any figure; and thus the world comes to be filled\nwith lies and fopperies. The reason that men doubt of divers things is\nthat they never examine common impressions; they do not dig to the root,\nwhere the faults and defects lie; they only debate upon the branches;\nthey do not examine whether such and such a thing be true, but if it\nhas been so and so understood; it is not inquired into whether Galen has\nsaid any thing to purpose, but whether he has said so or so. In truth it\nwas very good reason that this curb to the liberty of our judgments and\nthat tyranny over our opinions, should be extended to the schools and\narts. The god of scholastic knowledge is Aristotle; \u2018tis irreligion to\nquestion any of his decrees, as it was those of Lucurgus at Sparta;\nhis doctrine is a magisterial law, which, peradventure, is as false as\nanother. I do not know why I should not as willingly embrace either the\nideas of Plato, or the atoms of Epicurus, or the plenum or vacuum of\nLeucippus and Democritus, or the water of Thales, or the infinity\nof nature of Anaximander, or the air of Diogenes, or the numbers and\nsymmetry of Pythagoras, or the infinity of Parmenides, or the One of\nMus\u00e6us, or the water and fire of Apollodorus, or the similar parts of\nAnaxagoras, or the discord and friendship of Empedocles, or the fire of\nHeraclitus, or any other opinion of that infinite confusion of opinions\nand determinations, which this fine human reason produces by its\ncertitude and clearsightedness in every thing it meddles withal, as I\nshould the opinion of Aristotle upon this subject of the principles\nof natural things; which principles he builds of three pieces--matter,\nform, and privation. And what can be more vain than to make inanity\nitself the cause of the production of things? Privation is a negative;\nof what humour could he then make the cause and original of things that\nare? And yet that were not to be controverted but for the exercise of\nlogic; there is nothing disputed therein to bring it into doubt, but to\ndefend the author of the school from foreign objections; his authority\nis the non-ultra, beyond which it is not permitted to inquire.\n\nIt is very easy, upon approved foundations, to build whatever we please;\nfor, according to the law and ordering of this beginning, the other\nparts of the structure are easily carried on without any failure. By\nthis way we find our reason well-grounded, and discourse at a venture;\nfor our masters prepossess and gain beforehand as much room in our\nbelief as is necessary towards concluding afterwards what they\nplease, as geometricians do by their granted demands, the consent and\napprobation we allow them giving them wherewith to draw us to the right\nand left, and to whirl us about at their pleasure. Whatever springs from\nthese presuppositions is our master and our God; he will take the level\nof his foundations so ample and so easy that by them he may mount us\nup to the clouds, if he so please. In this practice and negotiation\nof science we have taken the saying of Pythagoras, \u201cThat every expert\nperson ought to be believed in his own art\u201d for current pay. The\nlogician refers the signification of words to the grammarians; the\nrhetorician borrows the state of arguments from the logician; the poet\nhis measure from the musician: the geometrician his proportions from\nthe arithmetician, and the metaphysicians take physical conjectures for\ntheir foundations; for every science has its principle presupposed, by\nwhich human judgment is everywhere kept in check. If you come to rush\nagainst the bar where the principal error lies, they have presently this\nsentence in their mouths, \u201cThat there is no disputing with persons who\ndeny principles.\u201d Now men can have no principles if not revealed to them\nby the divinity; of all the rest the beginning, the middle, and the\nend, is nothing but dream and vapour. To those that contend upon\npresupposition we must, on the contrary, presuppose to them the same\naxiom upon which the dispute is. For every human presupposition and\ndeclaration has as much authority one as another, if reason do not make\nthe difference. Wherefore they are all to be put into the balance, and\nfirst the generals and those that tyrannize over us. The persuasion of\ncertainty is a certain testimony of folly and extreme incertainty;\nand there are not a more foolish sort of men, nor that are less\nphilosophers, than the Philodoxes of Plato; we must inquire whether fire\nbe hot? whether snow be white? if there be any such things as hard or\nsoft within our knowledge?\n\nAnd as to those answers of which they make old stories, as he that\ndoubted if there was any such thing as heat, whom they bid throw himself\ninto the fire; and he that denied the coldness of ice, whom they bid\nto put ice into his bosom;--they are pitiful things, unworthy of the\nprofession of philosophy. If they had let us alone in our natural\nbeing, to receive the appearance of things without us, according as they\npresent themselves to us by our senses, and had permitted us to follow\nour own natural appetites, governed by the condition of our birth, they\nmight then have reason to talk at that rate; but \u2018tis from them we have\nlearned to make ourselves judges of the world; \u2018tis from them that we\nderive this fancy, \u201cThat human reason is controller-general of all that\nis without and within the roof of heaven; that comprehends every thing,\nthat can do every thing; by the means of which every thing is known and\nunderstood.\u201d This answer would be good among the cannibals, who enjoy\nthe happiness of a long, quiet, and peaceable life, without Aristotle\u2019s\nprecepts, and without the knowledge of the name of physics; this answer\nwould perhaps be of more value and greater force than all those they\nborrow from their reason and invention; of this all animals, and all\nwhere the power of the law of nature is yet pure and simple, would be\nas capable as we, but as for them they have renounced it. They need not\ntell us, \u201cIt is true, for you see and feel it to be so;\u201d they must tell\nme whether I really feel what I think I do; and if I do feel it, they\nmust then tell me why I feel it, and how, and what; let them tell me the\nname, original, the parts and junctures of heat and cold, the qualities\nof the agent and patient; or let them give up their profession, which is\nnot to admit or approve of any thing but by the way of reason; that is\ntheir test in all sorts of essays; but, certainly, \u2018tis a test full of\nfalsity, error, weakness, and defect.\n\nWhich way can we better prove it than by itself? If we are not to\nbelieve her when speaking of herself, she can hardly be thought fit to\njudge of foreign things; if she know any thing, it must at least be her\nown being and abode; she is in the soul, and either a part or an effect\nof it; for true and essential reason, from which we by a false colour\nborrow the name, is lodged in the bosom of the Almighty; there is her\nhabitation and recess; \u2018tis thence that she imparts her rays, when God\nis pleased to impart any beam of it to mankind, as Balias issued from\nher father\u2019s head, to communicate herself to the world.\n\nNow let us see what human reason tells us of herself and of the soul,\nnot of the soul in general, of which almost all philosophy makes the\ncelestial and first bodies participants; nor of that which Thales\nattributed to things which themselves are reputed inanimate, lead\nthereto by the consideration of the loadstone; but of that which\nappertains to us, and that we ought the best to know:--\n\n\n      Ignoratur enim, qu\u00e6 sit natura animai;\n   Nata sit; an, contra, nascentibus insinuetur;\n   Et simnl intereat nobiscum morte dirempta;\n   An tenebras Orci visat, vastasque lacunas,\n   An pecudes alias divinitns insinuet se.\n\n      \u201cFor none the nature of the soul doth know,\n   Whether that it be born with us, or no;\n   Or be infused into us at our birth,\n   And dies with us when we return to earth,\n   Or then descends to the black shades below,\n   Or into other animals does go.\u201d\n\n\nCrates and Dic\u00e6archus were of opinion that there was no soul at all,\nbut that the body thus stirs by a natural motion; Plato, that it was a\nsubstance moving of itself; Thales, a nature without repose; Aedepiades,\nan exercising of the senses; Hesiod and Anaximander, a thing composed of\nearth and water; Parmenides, of earth and fire; Empedocles, of blood:--\n\n\n   Sanguineam vomit ille animam;\n\n   \u201cHe vomits up his bloody soul.\u201d\n\n\nPosidonius, Cleanthes, and Galen, that it was heat or a hot complexion--\n\n\n   Igneus est ollis vigor, et colestis origo;\n\n   \u201cTheir vigour of fire and of heavenly race.\u201d\n\n\nHippocrates, a spirit diffused all over the body; Varro, that it was an\nair received at the mouth, heated in the lungs, moistened in the heart,\nand diffused throughout the whole body; Zeno, the quintessence of the\nfour elements; Heraclides Ponticus, that it was the light; Zenocrates\nand the Egyptians, a mobile number; the Chaldeans, a virtue without any\ndeterminate form:--\n\n\n      Habitum quemdam vitalem corporis esse,\n   Harmoniam Gr\u00e6ci quam dicunt.\n\n      \u201cA certain vital habit in man\u2019s frame,\n   Which harmony the Grecian sages name.\u201d\n\n\nLet us not forget Aristotle, who held the soul to be that which\nnaturally causes the body to move, which he calls entelechia, with\nas cold an invention as any of the rest; for he neither speaks of the\nessence, nor of the original, nor of the nature of the soul, but\nonly takes notice of the effect Lactantius, Seneca, and most of the\nDogmatists, have confessed that it was a thing they did not understand;\nafter all this enumeration of opinions, _Harum sententiarum quo vera\nsit, Deus aliquis viderit:_ \u201cOf these opinions which is the true, let\nsome god determine,\u201d says Cicero. \u201cI know by myself,\u201d says St Bernard,\n\u201chow incomprehensible God is, seeing I cannot comprehend the parts of my\nown being.\u201d\n\nHeraclitus, who was of opinion that every being was full of souls and\ndemons, did nevertheless maintain that no one could advance so far\ntowards the knowledge of the soul as ever to arrive at it; so profound\nwas the essence of it.\n\nNeither is there less controversy and debate about seating of it.\nHippocrates and Hierophilus place it in the ventricle of the brain;\nDemocritus and Aristotle throughout the whole body;--\n\n\n      Ut bona s\u00e6pe valetudo cum dicitur esse\n   Corporis, et non est tamen h\u00e6c pars ulla ralentis;\n\n      \u201cAs when the body\u2019s health they do it call,\n   When of a sound man, that\u2019s no part at all.\u201d\n\n\nEpicurus in the stomach;\n\n\n      Hic exsultat enim pavor ac metus;\n   H\u00e6c loca circum L\u00e6titi\u00e6 mulcent.\n\n      \u201cFor this the seat of horror is and fear,\n   And joys in turn do likewise triumph here.\u201d\n\n\nThe Stoics, about and within the heart; Erasistratus, adjoining the\nmembrane of the epicranium; Empedocles, in the blood; as also Moses,\nwhich was the reason why he interdicted eating the blood of beasts,\nbecause the soul is there seated; Galen thought that every part of the\nbody had its soul; Strato has placed it betwixt the eyebrows; _Qu\u00e2 facie\nquidem sit animus, aut ubi habitet, ne quorendum quidem est:_ \u201cWhat\nfigure the soul is of, or what part it inhabits, is not to be inquired\ninto,\u201d says Cicero. I very willingly deliver this author to you in his\nown words; for should I alter eloquence itself? Besides, it were but a\npoor prize to steal the matter of his inventions; they are neither\nvery frequent, nor of any great weight, and sufficiently known. But the\nreason why Chrysippus argues it to be about the heart, as all the rest\nof that sect do, is not to be omitted; \u201cIt is,\u201d says he, \u201cbecause when\nwe would affirm any things we lay our hand upon our breasts; and when\nwe would pronounce \u00e8y\u00f9, which signifies I, we let the lower jaw fall\ntowards the stomach.\u201d This place ought not to be passed over without\na remark upon the vanity of so great a man; for besides that these\nconsiderations are infinitely light in themselves, the last is only a\nproof to the Greeks that they have their souls lodged in that part. No\nhuman judgment is so sprightly and vigilant that it does not sometimes\nsleep. Why do we fear to say? The Stoics, the fathers of human prudence,\nthink that the soul of a man, crushed under a ruin, long labours\nand strives to get out, like a mouse caught in a trap, before it can\ndisengage itself from the burden. Some hold that the world was made to\ngive bodies, by way of punishment, to the spirits fallen, by their own\nfault, from the purity wherein they had been created, the first creation\nhaving been incorporeal; and that, according as they are more or less\ndepraved from their spirituality, so are they more or less jocundly or\ndully incorporated; and that thence proceeds all the variety of so much\ncreated matter. But the spirit that for his punishment was invested\nwith the body of the sun must certainly have a very rare and particular\nmeasure of change.\n\nThe extremities of our perquisition do all fall into astonishment\nand blindness; as Plutarch says of the testimony of histories, that,\naccording to charts and maps, the utmost bounds of known r countries are\ntaken up with marshes, impenetrable forests, deserts, and uninhabitable\nplaces; this is the reason why the most gross and childish ravings were\nmost found in those authors who treat of the most elevated subjects, and\nproceed the furthest in them, losing themselves in their own curiosity\nand presumption. The beginning and end of knowledge are equally foolish;\nobserve to what a pitch Plato flies in his poetic clouds; do but take\nnotice there of the gibberish of the gods; but what did he dream of when\nhe defined a man to be \u201ca two-legged animal without feathers: giving\nthose who had a mind to deride him a pleasant occasion; for, having\npulled a capon alive, they went about calling it the man of Plato.\u201d\n\nAnd what did the Epicureans think of, out of what simplicity did they\nfirst imagine that their _atoms_ that they said were bodies having some\nweight, and a natural motion downwards, had made the world; till\nthey were put in mind, by their adversaries, that, according to this\ndescription, it was impossible they should unite and join to one\nanother, their fall being so direct and perpendicular, and making so\nmany parallel lines throughout? Wherefore there was a necessity that\nthey should since add a fortuitous and sideways motion, and that they\nshould moreover accoutre their atoms with hooked tails, by which they\nmight unite and cling to one another. And even then do not those that\nattack them upon this second consideration put them hardly to it? \u201cIf\nthe atoms have by chance formed so many sorts of figures, why did it\nnever fall out that they made a house or a shoe? Why at the same rate\nshould we not believe that an infinite number of Greek letters,\nstrewed all over a certain place, might fall into the contexture of the\n_Iliad?_\u201d--\u201cWhatever is capable of reason,\u201d says Zeno, \u201cis better than\nthat which is not capable; there is nothing better than the world;\nthe world is therefore capable of reason.\u201d Cotta, by this way of\nargumentation, makes the world a mathematician; \u2018and tis also made a\nmusician and an organist by this other argumentation of Zeno: \u201cThe\nwhole is more than a part; we are capable of wisdom, and are part of the\nworld; therefore the world is wise.\u201d There are infinite like examples,\nnot only of arguments that are false in themselves, but silly ones, that\ndo not hold in themselves, and that accuse their authors not so much\nof ignorance as imprudence, in the reproaches the philosophers dash one\nanother in the teeth withal, upon their dissensions in their sects and\nopinions.\n\nWhoever should bundle up a lusty faggot of the fooleries of human wisdom\nwould produce wonders. I willingly muster up these few for a pattern,\nby a certain meaning not less profitable to consider than the most sound\nand moderate instructions. Let us judge by these what opinion we are to\nhave of man, of his sense and reason, when in these great persons that\nhave raised human knowledge so high, so many gross mistakes and manifest\nerrors are to be found.\n\nFor my part, I am apt to believe that they have treated of knowledge\ncasually, and like a toy, with both hands; and have contended about\nreason as of a vain and frivolous instrument, setting on foot all sorts\nof fancies and inventions, sometimes more sinewy, and sometimes weaker.\nThis same Plato, who defines man as if he were a cock, says elsewhere,\nafter Socrates, \u201cThat he does not, in truth, know what man is, and that\nhe is a member of the world the hardest to understand.\u201d By this variety\nand instability of opinions, they tacitly lead us, as it were by the\nhand, to this resolution of their irresolution. They profess not always\nto deliver their opinions barefaced and apparent to us; they have one\nwhile disguised them in the fabulous shadows of poetry, and at another\nin some other vizor; for our imperfection carries this also along with\nit, that crude meat is not always proper for our stomachs; we must dry,\nalter, and mix it; they do the same; they sometimes conceal their real\nopinions and judgments, and falsify them to accommodate themselves to\nthe public use. They will not make an open profession of ignorance, and\nof the imbecility of human reason, that they may not fright children;\nbut they sufficiently discover it to us under the appearance of a\ntroubled and inconstant science.\n\nI advised a person in Italy, who had a great mind to speak Italian, that\nprovided he only had a desire to make himself understood, without being\nambitious in any other respect to excel, that he should only make use\nof the first word that came to the tongue\u2019s end, whether Latin, French,\nSpanish, or Gascon, and that, by adding the Italian termination, he\ncould not fail of hitting upon some idiom of the country, either Tuscan,\nRoman, Venetian, Piedmontese, or Neapolitan, and so fall in with some\none of those many forms. I say the same of Philosophy; she has so many\nfaces, so much variety, and has said so many things, that all our dreams\nand ravings are there to be found. Human fancy can conceive nothing\ngood or bad that is not there: _Nihil tam absurde did potest, quod non\ndicatur ab aliquo philosophorum._ \u201cNothing can be said so absurd, that\nhas not been said before by some of the philosophers.\u201d And I am the more\nwilling to expose my whimsies to the public; forasmuch as, though they\nare spun out of myself, and without any pattern, I know they will be\nfound related to some ancient humour, and some will not stick to say,\n\u201cSee whence he took it!\u201d My manners are natural, I have not called in\nthe assistance of any discipline to erect them; but, weak as they are,\nwhen it came into my head to lay them open to the world\u2019s view, and that\nto expose them to the light in a little more decent garb I went to adorn\nthem with reasons and examples, it was a wonder to myself accidentally\nto find them conformable to so many philosophical discourses and\nexamples. I never knew what regimen my life was of till it was near\nworn out and spent; a new figure--an unpremeditated and accidental\nphilosopher.\n\nBut to return to the soul. Inasmuch as Plato has placed reason in the\nbrain, anger in the heart, and concupiscence in the liver; \u2018tis likely\nthat it was rather an interpretation of the movements of\n\nthe soul, than that he intended a division and separation of it, as of\na body, into several members. And the most likely of their opinions\nis that \u2018tis always a soul, that by its faculty, reasons, remembers,\ncomprehends, judges, desires, and exercises all its other operations by\ndivers instruments of the body; as the pilot guides his ship according\nto his experience, one while straining or slacking the cordage, one\nwhile hoisting the mainyard, or removing the rudder, by one and the same\npower carrying on several effects; and that it is lodged in the brain;\nwhich appears in that the wounds and accidents that touch that part do\nimmediately offend the faculties of the soul; and \u2018tis not incongruous\nthat it should thence diffuse itself through the other parts of the body\n\n\n      Medium non deserit unquam\n   Coeli Phoebus iter; radiis tamen omnia lustr\u00e2t.\n\n      \u201cPhoebus ne\u2019er deviates from the zodiac\u2019s way;\n   Yet all things doth illustrate with his ray.\u201d\n\n\nAs the sun sheds from heaven its light and influence, and fills the\nworld with them:--\n\n\n      C\u00e6tera pars animas, per totum dissita corpus,\n   Paret, et ad numen mentis momenque movetur.\n\n      \u201cThe other part o\u2019 th\u2019 soul diffus\u2019d all o\u2019er\n   The body, does obey the reason\u2019s lore.\u201d\n\n\nSome have said that there was a general soul, as it were a great body,\nwhence all the particular souls were extracted, and thither again\nreturn, always restoring themselves to that universal matter:--\n\n\n      Deum namque ire per omnes\n   Terrasque, tractusque maris, columque profundum;\n   Hinc pecudes, armenta, viros, genus omne ferarum,\n   Quemque sibi tenues nascentem arcessere vitas:\n   Scilicet hue reddi deinde, ac resoluta referri\n   Omnia; nec morti esse locum:\n\n      \u201cFor God goes forth, and spreads throughout the whole\n   Heaven, earth, and sea, the universal soul;\n   Each at its birth, from him all beings share,\n   Both man and brute, the breath of vital air;\n   To him return, and, loos\u2019d from earthly chain,\n   Fly whence they sprung, and rest in God again,\n   Spurn at the grave, and, fearless of decay,\n   Dwell in high heaven, and star th\u2019 ethereal way.\u201d\n\n\nOthers, that they only rejoined and reunited themselves to it; others,\nthat they were produced from the divine substance; others, by the angels\nof fire and air; others, that they were from all antiquity; and some\nthat they were created at the very point of time the bodies wanted\nthem; others make them to descend from the orb of the moon, and return\nthither; the generality of the ancients believed that they were begotten\nfrom father to son, after a like manner, and produced with all other\nnatural things; taking their argument from the likeness of children to\ntheir fathers;\n\n\n      Instillata patris virtus tibi;\n   Fortes creantur fortibus, et bonis;\n\n      \u201cThou hast thy father\u2019s virtues with his blood:\n   For still the brave spring from the brave and good;\u201d\n\n\nand that we see descend from fathers to their children not only\nbodily marks, but moreover a resemblance of humours, complexions, and\ninclinations of the soul:--\n\n\n      Denique cur acris violentia triste leonum\n   Seminium sequitur? dolus vulpibus, et fuga, cervis\n   A patribus datur, et patrius pavor incit\u00e2t artus?\n   Si non certa suo quia semine seminioque\n   Vis animi pariter crescit cum corpore toto.\n\n      \u201cFor why should rage from the fierce lion\u2019s seed,\n   Or from the subtle fox\u2019s craft, proceed;\n   Or why the tim\u2019rous and flying hart\n   His fear and trembling to his race impart;\n   But that a certain force of mind does grow,\n   And still increases as the bodies do?\u201d\n\n\nThat thereupon the divine justice is grounded, punishing in the children\nthe faults of their fathers; forasmuch as the contagion of paternal\nvices is in some sort imprinted in the soul of children, and that the\nill government of their will extends to them; moreover, that if souls\nhad any other derivation than a natural consequence, and that they had\nbeen some other thins out of the body, they would retain some memory\nof their first being, the natural faculties that are proper to them of\ndiscoursing, reasoning, and remembering, being considered:--\n\n\n      Si in corpus nascentibus insinuatur,\n   Cur super anteactam \u00e6tatem meminisse nequimus,\n   Nec vestigia gestarum rerum ulla tenemus?\n\n      \u201cFor at our birth if it infused be,\n   Why do we then retain no memory\n   Of our foregoing life, and why no more\n   Remember any thing we did before?\u201d\n\n\nfor, to make the condition of our souls such as we would have it to be,\nwe must suppose them all-knowing, even in their natural simplicity and\npurity; by these means they had been such, being free from the prison of\nthe body, as well before they entered into it, as we hope they shall be\nafter they are gone out of it; and from this knowledge it should follow\nthat they should remember, being got in the body, as Plato said, \u201cThat\nwhat we learn is no other than a remembrance of what we knew before;\u201d a\nthing which every one by experience may maintain to be false. Forasmuch,\nin the first place, as that we do not justly remember any thing but\nwhat we have been taught, and that if the memory did purely perform its\noffice it would at least suggest to us something more than what we have\nlearned. Secondly, that which she knew being in her purity, was a\ntrue knowledge, knowing things as they are by her divine intelligence;\nwhereas here we make her receive falsehood and vice when we instruct\nher; wherein she cannot employ her reminiscence, that image and\nconception having never been planted in her. To say that the corporal\nprison does in such sort suffocate her natural faculties, that they\nare there utterly extinct, is first contrary to this other belief of\nacknowledging her power to be so great, and the operations of it that\nmen sensibly perceive in this life so admirable, as to have thereby\nconcluded that divinity and eternity past, and the immortality to\ncome:--\n\n\n      Nam si tantopere est anirai mutata potestas,\n   Omnia ut actarum exciderit retinentia rerum,\n   Non, ut opinor, ea ab letho jam longior errat.\n\n      \u201cFor if the mind be changed to that degree\n   As of past things to lose all memory,\n   So great a change as that, I must confess,\n   Appears to me than death but little less.\u201d\n\n\nFurthermore, \u2018tis here with us, and not elsewhere, that the force\nand effects of the soul ought to be considered; all the rest of her\nperfections are vain and useless to her; \u2018tis by her present condition\nthat all her immortality is to be rewarded and paid, and of the life of\nman only that she is to render an account It had been injustice to have\nstripped her of her means and powers; to have disarmed her in order, in\nthe time of her captivity and imprisonment in the flesh, of her weakness\nand infirmity in the time wherein she was forced and compelled, to pass\nan infinite and perpetual sentence and condemnation, and to insist upon\nthe consideration of so short a time, peradventure but an hour or two,\nor at the most but a century, which has no more proportion with infinity\nthan an instant; in this momentary interval to ordain and definitively\nto determine of her whole being; it were an unreasonable disproportion,\ntoo, to assign an eternal recompense in consequence of so short a life.\nPlato, to defend himself from this inconvenience, will have future\npayments limited to the term of a hundred years, relatively to human\nduration; and of us ourselves there are enough who have given them\ntemporal limits. By this they judged that the generation of the soul\nfollowed the common condition of human things, as also her life,\naccording to the opinion of Epicurus and Democritus, which has been the\nmost received; in consequence of these fine appearances that they saw\nit bom, and that, according as the body grew more capable, they saw it\nincrease in vigour as the other did; that its feebleness in infancy was\nvery manifest, and in time its better strength and maturity, and after\nthat its declension and old age, and at last its decrepitude:--\n\n\n      Gigni pariter cum corpore, et una\n   Crescere sentimus, pariterque senescere mentem.\n\n      \u201cSouls with the bodies to be born we may\n   Discern, with them t\u2019 increase, with them decay.\u201d\n\n\nThey perceived it to be capable of divers passions, and agitated with\ndivers painful motions, whence it fell into lassitude and uneasiness;\ncapable of alteration and change, of cheerfulness, of stupidity and\nlanguor, and subject to diseases and injuries, as the stomach or the\nfoot;\n\n\n      Mentem sanari, corpus ut \u00e6grum,\n   Ceraimus, et flecti medicin\u00e2 posse videmus;\n\n      \u201cSick minds, as well as bodies, we do see\n   By Med\u2019cine\u2019s virtue oft restored to be;\u201d\n\n\ndazzled and intoxicated with the fumes of wine, jostled from her seat by\nthe vapours of a burning fever, laid asleep by the application of some\nmedicaments, and roused by others,--\n\n\n      Corpoream naturam animi esse necesse est,\n   Corporeis quoniam telis ictuque laborat;\n\n      \u201cThere must be of necessity, we find,\n   A nature that\u2019s corporeal of the mind,\n   Because we evidently see it smarts\n   And wounded is with shafts the body darts;\u201d\n\n\nthey saw it astonished and overthrown in all its faculties through the\nmere bite of a mad dog, and in that condition to have no stability\nof reason, no sufficiency, no virtue, no philosophical resolution, no\nresistance that could exempt it from the subjection of such accidents;\nthe slaver of a contemptible cur shed upon the hand of Socrates, to\nshake all his wisdom and all his great and regulated imaginations, and\nso to annihilate them, ad that there remained no trace of his former\nknowledge,--\n\n\n      Vis.... animal Conturbatur, et.... divisa seorsum\n   Disjectatur, eodem illo distracta veneno;\n\n      \u201cThe power of the soul\u2019s disturbed; and when\n   That once is but sequestered from her, then\n   By the same poison \u2018tis dispersed abroad;\u201d\n\n\nand this poison to find no more resistance in that great soul than in an\ninfant of four years old; a poison sufficient to make all philosophy, if\nit were incarnate, become furious and mad; insomuch that Cato, who\never disdained death and fortune, could not endure the sight of a\nlooking-glass, or of water, overwhelmed with horror and affright at\nthe thought of falling, by the contagion of a mad dog, into the disease\ncalled by physicians hydrophobia:--\n\n\n      Vis morbi distracta per artus\n   Turbat agens animam, spumantes \u00e6quore salso\n   Ventorum ut validis fervescunt viribus und\u00e6.\n\n      \u201cThroughout the limbs diffused, the fierce disease\n   Disturbs the soul, as in the briny seas,\n   The foaming waves to swell and boil we see,\n   Stirred by the wind\u2019s impetuosity.\u201d\n\n\nNow, as to this particular, philosophy has sufficiently armed man to\nencounter all other accidents either with patience, or, if the search\nof that costs too dear, by an infallible defeat, in totally depriving\nhimself of all sentiment; but these are expedients that are only of use\nto a soul being itself, and in its full power, capable of reason and\ndeliberation; but not at all proper for this inconvenience, where, in\na philosopher, the soul becomes the soul of a madman, troubled,\noverturned, and lost; which many occasions may produce, as a too\nvehement agitation that any violent passion of the soul may beget in\nitself; or a wound in a certain part of the person, or vapours from the\nstomach, any of which may stupefy the understanding and turn the brain.\n\n\n      Morbis in corporis avius errat\n   S\u00e6pe animus; dementit enim, deliraque fatur;\n   Interdumque gravi lethargo fertur in altum\n   \u00c6ternumque soporem, oculis mi tuque cadenti:\n\n      \u201cFor when the body\u2019s sick, and ill at ease,\n   The mind doth often share in the disease;\n   Wonders, grows wild, and raves, and sometimes by\n   A heavy and a stupid lethargy,\n   Is overcome and cast into a deep,\n   A most profound and everlasting sleep.\u201d\n\n\nThe philosophers, methinks, have not much touched this string, no more\nthan another of equal importance; they have this dilemma continually\nin their mouths, to console our mortal condition: \u201cThe soul is either\nmortal or immortal; if mortal, it will suffer no pain; if immortal, it\nwill change for the better.\u201d--They never touch the other branch, \u201cWhat\nif she change for the worse?\u201d and leave to the poets the menaces of\nfuture torments. But thereby they make themselves a good game. These are\ntwo omissions that I often meet with in their discourses. I return to\nthe first.\n\nThis soul loses the use of the sovereign stoical good, so constant and\nso firm. Our fine human wisdom must here yield, and give up her arms. As\nto the rest, they also considered, by the vanity of human reason, that\nthe mixture and association of two so contrary things as the mortal and\nthe immortal, was unimaginable:--\n\n\n      Quippe etenim mortale \u00e6terao jungere, et una\n   Consentire putare, et fungi mutua posse,\n   Desipere est. Quid enim diversius esse putandum est,\n   Aut magis inter se disjunctum discrepitansque,\n   Quam, mortale quod est, immortali atque perenni\n   Junctum, in concilio, s\u00e6vas tolerare procellas?\n\n      \u201cThe mortal and th\u2019 eternal, then, to blend,\n   And think they can pursue one common end,\n   Is madness: for what things more diff\u2019rent are.\n   Distinct in nature, and disposed to jar?\n   How can it then be thought that these should bear,\n   When thus conjoined, of harms an equal share?\u201d\n\n\nMoreover, they perceived the soul tending towards death as well as the\nbody:--\n\n\n   Simul ovo fessa fatiscit:\n\n   \u201cFatigued together with the weight of years:\u201d\n\n\nwhich, according to Zeno, the image of sleep does sufficiently\ndemonstrate to us; for he looks upon it \u201cas a fainting and fall of the\nsoul, as well as of the body:\u201d _Contrahi animum et quasi labi putat\natque decidere:_ and, what they perceived in some, that the soul\nmaintained its force and vigour to the last gasp of life, they\nattributed to the variety of diseases, as it is observable in men at the\nlast extremity, that some retain one sense, and some another; one\nthe hearing, and another the smell, without any manner of defect or\nalteration; and that there is not so universal a deprivation that some\nparts do not remain vigorous and entire:--\n\n\n      Non alio pacto, quam si, pes cum dolet \u00e6gri,\n   In nullo caput interea sit forte dolore.\n\n      \u201cSo, often of the gout a man complains,\n   Whose head is, at the same time, free from pains.\u201d\n\n\nThe sight of our judgment is, to truth, the same that the owl\u2019s eyes\nare to the splendour of the sun, says Aristotle. By what can we better\nconvince him, than by so gross blindness in so apparent a light? For the\ncontrary opinion of the immortality of the soul, which, Cicero says,\nwas first introduced, according to the testimony of books at least, by\nPherecydes\n\nSyrius, in the time of King Tullus (though some attribute it to Thales,\nand others to others), \u2018tis the part of human science that is treated of\nwith the greatest doubt and\n\nreservation. The most positive dogmatists are fain, in this point\nprincipally, to fly to the refuge of the Academy. No one doubts what\nAristotle has established upon this subject, no more than all the\nancients in general, who handle it with a wavering belief: _Rem\ngratissimam promittentium magis quam probantium:_ \u201cA thing more\nacceptable in the promisors than the provers.\u201d He conceals himself in\nclouds of words of difficult, unintelligible sense, and has left to\nthose of his sect as great a dispute about his judgment as about the\nmatter itself.\n\nTwo things rendered this opinion plausible to them; one, that, without\nthe immortality of souls, there would be nothing whereon to ground the\nvain hopes of glory, which is a consideration of wonderful\n\nrepute in the world; the other, that it is a very profitable impression,\nas Plato says, that vices, when they escape the discovery and cognizance\nof human justice, are still within the reach of the divine, which will\npursue them even after the death of the guilty. Man is excessively\nsolicitous to prolong his being, and has to the utmost of his power\nprovided for it; there are monuments for the conservation of the body,\nand glory to preserve the name. He has employed all his wit and opinion\nto the rebuilding of himself, impatient of his fortune, and to prop\nhimself by his inventions. The soul, by reason of its anxiety and\nimpotence, being unable to stand by itself, wanders up and down to seek\nout consolations, hopes, and foundations, and alien circumstances, to\nwhich she adheres and fixes; and how light or fantastic soever invention\ndelivers them to her, relies more willingly, and with greater assurance,\nupon them than upon herself. But \u2018tis wonderful to observe how the most\nconstant and obstinate maintainers of this just and clear persuasion\nof the immortality of the soul fall short, and how weak their arguments\nare, when they go about to prove it by human reason: _Somnia sunt non\ndocentis, sed optantis:_ \u201cThey are dreams, not of the teacher, but\nwisher,\u201d says one of the ancients. By which testimony man may know that\nhe owes the truth he himself finds out to fortune and accident; since\nthat even then, when it is fallen into his hand, he has not wherewith to\nhold and maintain it, and that his reason has not force to make use of\nit. All things produced by our own meditation and understanding, whether\ntrue or false, are subject to incertitude and controversy. \u2018Twas for\nthe chastisement of our pride, and for the instruction of our miserable\ncondition and incapacity, that God wrought the perplexity and confusion\nof the tower of Babel. Whatever we undertake without his assistance,\nwhatever we see without the lamp of his grace, is but vanity and folly.\nWe corrupt the very essence of truth, which is uniform and constant,\nby our weakness, when fortune puts it into our possession. What course\nsoever man takes of himself, God still permits it to come to the same\nconfusion, the image whereof he so lively represents to us in the just\nchastisement wherewith he crushed Nimrod\u2019s presumption, and frustrated\nthe vain attempt of his proud structure; _Perdam sapientiam sapientium,\net prudentiam prudentium reprobabo._ \u201cI will destroy the wisdom of the\nwise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent.\u201d The\ndiversity of idioms and tongues, with which he disturbed this work,\nwhat are they other than this infinite and perpetual alteration and\ndiscordance of opinions and reasons, which accompany and confound the\nvain building of human wisdom, and to very good effect too; for what\nwould hold us, if we had but the least grain of knowledge? This saint\nhas very much obliged me: _Ipsa veritatis occultatio ant humili-tatis\nexercitatio est, aut elationis attritio_ \u201cThe very concealment of the\ntruth is either an exercise of humility or a quelling of presumption.\u201d\n To what a pitch of presumption and insolence do we raise our blindness\nand folly!\n\nBut to return to my subject. It was truly very good reason that we\nshould be beholden to God only, and to the favour of his grace, for the\ntruth of so noble a belief, since from his sole bounty we receive\nthe fruit of immortality, which consists in the enjoyment of eternal\nbeatitude. Let us ingenuously confess that God alone has dictated it\nto us, and faith; for \u2018tis no lesson of nature and our own reason.\nAnd whoever will inquire into his own being and power, both within\nand without, without this divine privilege; whoever shall consider\nman impartially, and without flattery, will see in him no efficacy or\nfaculty that relishes of any thing but death and earth. The more we\ngive and confess to owe and render to God, we do it with the greater\nChristianity. That which this Stoic philosopher says he holds from the\nfortuitous consent of the popular voice; had it not been better that he\nhad held it from God? _Cum de animarum otemitate disserimus, non leve\nmomentum apud nos habet consensus hominum aut timentium inferos, aut\ncolentium. Utor h\u00e2c public\u00e2 persuasione._ \u201cWhen we discourse of the\nimmortality of souls, the consent of men that either fear or adore the\ninfernal powers, is of no small advantage. I make use of this public\npersuasion.\u201d Now the weakness of human arguments upon this subject\nis particularly manifested by the fabulous circumstances they have\nsuperadded as consequences of this opinion, to find out of what\ncondition this immortality of ours was. Let us omit the Stoics, (_usuram\nnobis largiuntur tanquam cornicibus; diu mansuros aiunt animos; semper,\nnegant._ \u201cThey give us a long life, as also they do to crows; they say\nour soul shall continue long, but that it shall continue always they\ndeny,\u201d) who give to souls a life after this, but finite. The most\nuniversal and received fancy, and that continues down to our times in\nvarious places, is that of which they make Pythagoras the author; not\nthat he was the original inventor, but because it received a great deal\nof weight and repute by the authority of his approbation: \u201cThat souls,\nat their departure out of us, did nothing but shift from one body to\nanother, from a lion to a horse, from a horse to a king, continually\ntravelling at this rate from habitation to habitation;\u201d and he himself\nsaid that he remembered he had been \u00c6tha-lides, since that Euphorbus,\nafterwards Hermotimus, and, finally, from Pyrrhus was passed into\nPythagoras; having a memory of himself of two hundred and six years. And\nsome have added that these very souls sometimes mount up to heaven, and\ncome down again:--\n\n\n      O pater, aime aliquas ad colum hinc ire putandum est\n   Sublimes animas, iterumque ad tarda reverti\n   Corpora? Qu\u00e6 lucis miseris tam dira cupido?\n\n      \u201cO, father, is it then to be conceiv\u2019d\n   That any of these spirits, so sublime,\n   Should hence to the celestial regions climb,\n   And thence return to earth to reassume\n   Their sluggish bodies rotting in a tomb?\n   For wretched life whence does such fondness come?\u201d\n\n\nOrigen makes them eternally to go and come from a better to a worse\nestate. The opinion that Varro mentions is that, after four hundred and\nforty years\u2019 revolution, they should be reunited to their first bodies;\nChrysippus held that this would happen after a certain space of time\nunknown and unlimited. Plato, who professes to have embraced this belief\nfrom Pindar and the ancient poets, that we are to undergo infinite\nvicissitudes of mutation, for which the soul is prepared, having neither\npunishment nor reward in the other world but what is temporal, as its\nlife here is but temporal, concludes that it has a singular knowledge of\nthe affairs of heaven, of hell, of the world, through all which it has\npassed, repassed, and made stay in several voyages, are matters for her\nmemory. Observe her progress elsewhere: \u201cThe soul that has lived well\nis reunited to the stars to which it is assigned; that which has lived\nill removes into a woman, and if it do not there reform, is again\nremoved into a beast of condition suitable to its vicious manners, and\nshall see no end of its punishments till it be returned to its natural\nconstitution, and that it has, by the force of reason, purged itself\nfrom those gross, stupid, and elementary qualities it was polluted\nwith.\u201d But I will not omit the objection the Epicureans make against\nthis transmigration from one body to another; \u2018tis a pleasant one; they\nask what expedient would be found out if the number of the dying should\nchance to be greater than that of those who are coming into the world.\nFor the souls, turned out of their old habitation, would scuffle and\ncrowd which should first get possession of their new lodging; and they\nfurther demand how they shall pass away their time, whilst waiting\ntill new quarters are made ready for them? Or, on the contrary, if more\nanimals should be born than die, the body, they say, would be but in an\nill condition whilst waiting for a soul to be infused into it; and it\nwould fall out that some bodies would die before they had been alive.\n\n\n      Denique comrabia ad Veneris, partusque ferarum\n   Esse animas pr\u00e6sto, deridiculum esse videtur;\n   Et spectare immortales mortalia membra\n   Innumero num\u00e9ro, certareque pr\u00e6properanter\n   Inter se, qu\u00e6 prima potissimaq\u00e6 insinueter.\n\n      \u201cAbsurd to think that whilst wild beasts beget,\n   Or bear their young, a thousand souls do wait,\n   Expect the falling body, fight and strive\n   Which first shall enter in and make it live.\u201d\n\n\nOthers have arrested the soul in the body of the deceased, with it to\nanimate serpents, worms, and other beasts, which are said to be bred\nout of the corruption of our members, and even out of our ashes; others\ndivide them into two parts, the one mortal, the other immortal; others\nmake it corporeal, and nevertheless immortal. Some make it immortal,\nwithout\n\nsense or knowledge. There are others, even among ourselves, who have\nbelieved that devils were made of the souls of the damned; as Plutarch\nthinks that gods were made of those that were saved; for there are few\nthings which that author is so positive in as he is in this; maintaining\nelsewhere a doubtful and ambiguous way of expression. \u201cWe are told,\u201d\n says he, \u201cand steadfastly should believe, that the souls of virtuous\nmen, both according to nature and the divine justice, become saints, and\nfrom saints demigods, and from demigods, after they are perfectly, as in\nsacrifices of purgation, cleansed and purified, being delivered from all\npassibility and all mortality, they become, not by any civil decree, but\nin real truth, and according to all probability of reason, entire and\nperfect gods, in receiving a most happy and glorious end.\u201d But who\ndesires to see him--him, who is yet the most sober and moderate of the\nwhole gang of philosophers, lay about him with greater boldness, and\nrelate his miracles upon this subject, I refer him to his treatise _of\nthe Moon,_ and _of the Demon of Socrates_, where he may, as evidently\nas in any other place whatever, satisfy himself that the mysteries of\nphilosophy have many strange things in common with those of poetry;\nhuman understanding losing itself in attempting to sound and search all\nthings to the bottom; even as we, tired and worn out with a long course\nof life, return to infancy and dotage. See here the fine and certain\ninstructions which we extract from human knowledge concerning the soul.\n\nNeither is there less temerity in what they teach us touching our\ncorporal parts. Let us choose out one or two examples; for otherwise we\nshould lose ourselves in this vast and troubled ocean of medical errors.\nLet us first know whether, at least, they agree about the matter whereof\nmen produce one another; for as to their first production it is\nno wonder if, in a thing so high and so long since past, human\nunderstanding finds itself puzzled and perplexed. Archelaus, the\nphysician, whose disciple and favourite Socrates was, according to\nAristoxenus, said that both men and beasts were made of a lacteous\nslime, expressed by the heat of the earth; Pythagoras says that our\nseed is the foam or cream of our better blood; Plato, that it is the\ndistillation of the marrow of the backbone; raising his argument from\nthis, that that part is first sensible of being weary of the work;\nAlcmeon, that it is part of the substance of the brain, and that it\nis so, says he, is proved by the weakness of the eyes in those who\nare immoderate in that exercise; Democritus, that it is a substance\nextracted from the whole mass of the body; Epicurus, an extract from\nsoul and body; Aristotle, an excrement drawn from the aliment of the\nblood, the last which is diffused over our members; others, that it is\na blood concocted and digested by the heat of the genitals, which they\njudge, by reason that in excessive endeavours a man voids pure blood;\nwherein there seems to be more likelihood, could a man extract any\nappearance from so infinite a confusion. Now, to bring this seed to do\nits work, how many contrary opinions do they set on foot? Aristotle\nand Democritus are of opinion that women have no sperm, and that \u2018tis\nnothing but a sweat that they distil in the heat of pleasure and\nmotion, and that contributes nothing at all to generation. Galen, on\nthe contrary, and his followers, believe that without the concurrence\nof seeds there can be no generation. Here are the physicians, the\nphilosophers, the lawyers, and divines, by the ears with our wives about\nthe dispute, \u201cFor what term women carry their fruit?\u201d and I, for my\npart, by the example of myself, stick with those that maintain a woman\ngoes eleven months with child. The world is built upon this experience;\nthere is no so commonplace a woman that cannot give her judgment in all\nthese controversies; and yet we cannot agree.\n\nHere is enough to verify that man is no better instructed in the\nknowledge of himself, in his corporal than in his spiritual part We have\nproposed himself to himself, and his reason to his reason, to see what\nshe could say. I think I have sufficiently demonstrated how little\nshe understands herself in herself; and who understands not himself in\nhimself, in what can he? _Quasi vero mensuram ullius rei possit agere,\nqui sui nesciat._ \u201cAs if he could understand the measure of any other\nthing, that knows not his own.\u201d In earnest, Protagoras told us a pretty\nflam in making man the measure of all things, that never knew so much as\nhis own; and if it be not he, his dignity will not permit that any\nother creature should have this advantage; now he being so contrary\nin himself, and one judgment so incessantly subverting another, this\nfavourable proposition was but a mockery, which induced us necessarily\nto conclude the nullity of the compass and the compasser. When Thales\nreputes the knowledge of man very difficult for man to comprehend, he\nat the same time gives him to understand that all other knowledge is\nimpossible.\n\nYou,* for whom I have taken the pains, contrary to my custom, to write\nso long a discourse, will not refuse to support your Sebond by the\nordinary forms of arguing, wherewith you are every day instructed, and\nin this will exercise both your wit and learning; for this last fencing\ntrick is never to be made use of but as an extreme remedy; \u2018tis a\ndesperate thrust, wherein you are to quit your own arms to make your\nadversary abandon his; and a secret sleight, which must be very rarely,\nand then very reservedly, put in practice. \u2018Tis great temerity to lose\nyourself that you may destroy another; you must not die to be revenged,\nas Gobrias did; for, being closely grappled in combat with a lord of\nPersia, Darius coming in sword in hand, and fearing to strike lest he\nshould kill Gobrias, he called out to him boldly to fall on,\n\n\n   * The author, as we have already mentioned, is addressing\n     Margaret de Valois.\n\n\nthough he should run them both through at once. I have known desperate\nweapons, and conditions of single combat, and wherein he that offered\nthem put himself and his adversary upon terms of inevitable death to\nthem both, censured for unjust. The Portuguese, in the Indian Sea, took\ncertain Turks prisoners, who, impatient of their captivity, resolved,\nand it succeeded, by striking the nails of the ship one against another,\nand making a spark to fall into the barrels of powder that were set in\nthe place where they were guarded, to blow up and reduce themselves,\ntheir masters, and the vessel to ashes. We here touch the out-plate\nand utmost limits of sciences, wherein the extremity is vicious, as\nin virtue. Keep yourselves in the common road; it is not good to be so\nsubtle and cunning. Remember the Tuscan proverb:--\n\n\n   Chi troppo s\u2019assottiglia, si scavezza.\n\n   \u201cWho makes himself too wise, becomes a fool.\u201d\n\n\nI advise you that, in all your opinions and discourses, as well as\nin your manners and all other things, you keep yourself moderate and\ntemperate, and avoid novelty; I am an enemy to all extravagant ways.\nYou, who by the authority of your grandeur, and yet more by the\nadvantages which those qualities give you that are more your own, may\nwith the twinkle of an eye command whom you please, ought to have given\nthis charge to some one who made profession of letters, who might after\na better manner have proved and illustrated these things to you. But\nhere is as much as you will stand in need of.\n\nEpicurus said of the laws, \u201cThat the worst were so necessary for us that\nwithout them men would devour one another.\u201d And Plato affirms, \u201cThat\nwithout laws we should live like beasts.\u201d Our wit is a wandering,\ndangerous, and temerarious utensil; it is hard to couple any order or\nmeasure to it; in those of our own time, who are endued with any rare\nexcellence above others, or any extraordinary vivacity of understanding,\nwe see them almost all lash out into licentiousness of opinions and\nmanners; and \u2018tis almost a miracle to find one temperate and sociable.\n\u2018Tis all the reason in the world to limit human wit within the strictest\nlimits imaginable; in study, as in all the rest, we ought to have\nits steps and advances numbered and fixed, and that the limits of its\ninquisition be bounded by art. It is curbed and fettered by religions,\nlaws, customs, sciences, precepts, mortal and immortal penalties. And\nyet we see that it escapes from all these bonds by its volubility and\ndissolution; *tis a vain body which has nothing to lay hold on or to\nseize; a various and difform body, incapable of being either bound\nor held. In earnest, there are few souls so regular, firm, and well\ndescended, as are to be trusted with their own conduct, and that can\nwith moderation, and without temerity, sail in the liberty of their own\njudgments, beyond the common and received opinions; *tis more expedient\nto put them under pupilage. Wit is a dangerous weapon, even to the\npossessor, if he knows not how to use it discreetly; and there is not a\nbeast to whom a headboard is more justly to be given, to keep his looks\ndown and before his feet, and to hinder him from wandering here and\nthere out of the tracks which custom and the laws have laid before him.\nAnd therefore it will be better for you to keep yourself in the beaten\npath, let it be what it will, than to fly out at a venture with this\nunbridled liberty. But if any of these new doctors will pretend to be\ningenious in your presence, at the expense both of your soul and his\nown, to avoid this dangerous plague, which is every day laid in your\nway to infect you, this preservative, in the extremest necessity,\nwill prevent the danger and hinder the contagion of this poison from\noffending either you or your company.\n\nThe liberty, then, and frolic forwardness of these ancient wits produced\nin philosophy and human sciences several sects of different opinions,\nevery one undertaking to judge and make choice of what he would stick\nto and maintain. But now that men go all one way, _Qui certis quibusdam\ndestinatisque sententiis addicti et consecrati sunt, ut etiam, qu\u00e6 non\nprobant, cogantur defendere,_ \u201cWho are so tied and obliged to certain\nopinions that they are bound to defend even those they do not approve,\u201d\n and that we receive the arts by civil authority and decree, so that the\nschools have but one pattern, and a like circumscribed institution and\ndiscipline, we no more take notice what the coin weighs, and is really\nworth, but every one receives it according to the estimate that common\napprobation and use puts upon it; the alloy is not questioned, but how\nmuch it is current for. In like manner all things pass; we take\nphysic as we do geometry; and tricks of hocus-pocus, enchantments,\nand love-spells, the correspondence of the souls of the dead,\nprognostications, domifications, and even this ridiculous pursuit of the\nphilosophers\u2019 stone, all things pass for current pay, without any manner\nof scruple or contradiction. We need to know no more but that Mars\u2019\nhouse is in the middle of the triangle of the hand, that of Venus in\nthe thumb, and that of Mercury in the little finger; that when the\ntable-line cuts the tubercle of the forefinger \u2018tis a sign of cruelty,\nthat when it falls short of the middle finger, and that the natural\nmedian-line makes an angle with the vital in the same side, \u2018tis a sign\nof a miserable death; that if in a woman the natural line be open, and\ndoes not close the angle with the vital, this denotes that she shall not\nbe very chaste. I leave you to judge whether a man qualified with such\nknowledge may not pass with reputation and esteem in all companies.\n\nTheophrastus said that human knowledge, guided by the senses, might\njudge of the causes of things to a certain degree; but that being\narrived to first and extreme causes, it must stop short and retire, by\nreason either of its own infirmity or the difficulty of things. \u2018Tis a\nmoderate and gentle opinion, that our own understandings may conduct\nus to the knowledge of some things, and that it has certain measures\nof power, beyond which \u2018tis temerity to employ it; this opinion is\nplausible, and introduced by men of well composed minds, but \u2018tis hard\nto limit our wit, which is curious and greedy, and will no more stop\nat a thousand than at fifty paces; having experimentally found that,\nwherein one has failed, the other has hit, and that what was unknown to\none age, the age following has explained; and that arts and sciences are\nnot cast in a mould, but are formed and perfected by degrees, by often\nhandling and polishing, as bears leisurely lick their cubs into form;\nwhat my force cannot discover, I do not yet desist to sound and to try;\nand by handling and kneading this new matter over and over again, by\nturning and heating it, I lay open to him that shall succeed me, a kind\nof facility to enjoy it more at his ease, and make it more maniable and\nsupple for him,\n\n\n        Ut hymettia sole\n     Cera remollescit, tractataque poll ice multas\n     Vertitur in facies, ipsoque fit utilis usu;\n\n        \u201cAs wax doth softer in the sun become,\n     And, tempered \u2018twixt the finger and the thumb,\n     Will varions forms, and several shapes admit,\n     Till for the present use \u2018tis rendered fit;\u201d\n\n\nas much will the second do for the third; which is the cause that\nthe difficulty ought not to make me despair, and my own incapacity as\nlittle; for \u2018tis nothing but my own.\n\nMan is as capable of all things as of some; and if he confesses, as\nTheophrastus says, the ignorance of first causes, let him at once\nsurrender all the rest of his knowledge; if he is defective in\nfoundation, his reason is aground; disputation and inquiry have no other\naim nor stop but principles; if this aim do not stop his career, he\nruns into an infinite irresolution. _Non potest aliud alio magis minusve\ncomprehendi, quoniam omnium rerum una est dejinitio comprehendendi:_\n\n\u201cOne thing can no more or less be comprehended than another, because\nthe definition of comprehending all things is the same.\u201d Now \u2018tis very\nlikely that, if the soul knew any thing, it would in the first place\nknow itself; and if it knew any thing out of itself, it would be its own\nbody and case, before any thing else. If we see the gods of physic to\nthis very day debating about our anatomy,\n\n\n   Mulciber in Trojam, pro Troj\u00e2 stabat Apollo;\n\n   \u201cVulcan against, for Troy Apollo stood;\u201d\n\n\nwhen are we to expect that they will be agreed? We are nearer neighbours\nto ourselves than whiteness to snow, or weight to stones. If man do not\nknow himself, how should he know his force and functions? It is not,\nperhaps, that we have not some real knowledge in us; but \u2018tis by chance;\nforasmuch as errors are received into our soul by the same way, after\nthe same manner, and by the same conduct, it has not wherewithal to\ndistinguish them, nor wherewithal to choose the truth from falsehood.\n\nThe Academics admitted a certain partiality of judgment, and thought it\ntoo crude to say that it was not more likely to say that snow was white\nthan black; and that we were no more assured of the motion of a stone,\nthrown by the hand, than of that of the eighth sphere. And to avoid\nthis difficulty and strangeness, that can in truth hardly lodge in our\nimagination, though they concluded that we were in no sort capable of\nknowledge, and that truth is engulfed in so profound an abyss as is not\nto be penetrated by human sight; yet they acknowledged some things to be\nmore likely than others, and received into their judgment this faculty,\nthat they had a power to incline to one appearance more than another,\nthey allowed him this propension, interdicting all resolution. The\nPyrrhonian opinion is more bold, and also somewhat more likely; for this\nacademic inclination, and this propension to one proposition rather than\nanother, what is it other than a recognition of some more apparent\ntruth in this than in that? If our understanding be capable of the form,\nlineaments, port, and face of truth, it might as well see it entire as\nby halves, springing and imperfect This appearance of likelihood,\nwhich makes them rather take the left hand than the right, augments\nit; multiply this ounce of verisimilitude that turns the scales to\na hundred, to a thousand, ounces; it will happen in the end that the\nbalance will itself end the controversy, and determine one choice, one\nentire truth. But why do they suffer themselves to incline to and be\nswayed by verisimilitude, if they know not the truth? How should they\nknow the similitude of that whereof they do not know the essence? Either\nwe can absolutely judge, or absolutely we cannot If our intellectual and\nsensible faculties are without foot or foundation, if they only pull\nand drive, \u2018tis to no purpose that we suffer our judgments to be carried\naway with any part of their operation, what appearance soever they\nmay seem to present us; and the surest and most happy seat of our\nunderstanding would be that where it kept itself temperate, upright, and\ninflexible, without tottering, or without agitation: _Inter visa, vera\naut falsa, ad animi assensum, nihil interest:_ \u201cAmongst things that\nseem, whether true or false, it signifies nothing to the assent of the\nmind.\u201d That things do not lodge in us in their form and essence, and\ndo not there make their entry by their own force and authority, we\nsufficiently see; because, if it were so, we should receive them after\nthe same manner; wine would have the same relish with the sick as with\nthe healthful; he who has his finger chapt or benumbed would find the\nsame hardness in wood or iron that he handles that another does; foreign\nsubjects then surrender themselves to our mercy, and are seated in us as\nwe please. Now if on our part we received any thing without alteration,\nif human grasp were capable and strong enough to seize on truth by our\nown means, these means being common to all men, this truth would be\nconveyed from hand to hand, from one to another; and at least there\nwould be some one thing to be found in the world, amongst so many as\nthere are, that would be believed by men with an universal consent;\nbut this, that there is no one proposition that is not debated and\ncontroverted amongst us, or that may not be, makes it very manifest that\nour natural judgment does not very clearly discern what it embraces; for\nmy judgment cannot make my companions approve of what it approves; which\nis a sign that I seized it by some other means than by a natural power\nthat is in me and in all other men.\n\nLet us lay aside this infinite confusion of opinions, which we see even\namongst the philosophers themselves, and this perpetual and universal\ndispute about the knowledge of things; for this is truly presupposed,\nthat men, I mean the most knowing, the best bom, and of the best parts,\nare not agreed about any one thing, not that heaven is over our heads;\nfor they that doubt of every thing, do also doubt of that; and they\nwho deny that we are able to comprehend any thing, say that we have not\ncomprehended that the heaven is over our heads, and these two opinions\nare, without comparison, the stronger in number.\n\nBesides this infinite diversity and division, through the trouble that\nour judgment gives ourselves, and the incertainty that every one is\nsensible of in himself, \u2018tis easy to perceive that its seat is very\nunstable and insecure. How variously do we judge of things?--How often\ndo we alter our opinions? What I hold and believe to-day I hold and\nbelieve with my whole belief; all my instruments and engines seize and\ntake hold of this opinion, and become responsible to me for it, at least\nas much as in them lies; I could not embrace nor conserve any truth\nwith greater confidence and assurance than I do this; I am wholly and\nentirely possessed with it; but has it not befallen me, not only once,\nbut a hundred, a thousand times, every day, to have embraced some other\nthing with all the same instruments, and in the same condition, which\nI have since judged to be false? A man must at least become wise at his\nown expense; if I have often found myself betrayed under this colour; if\nmy touch proves commonly false, and my balance unequal and unjust, what\nassurance can I now have more than at other times? Is it not stupidity\nand madness to suffer myself to be so often deceived by my guide?\nNevertheless, let fortune remove and shift us five hundred times from\nplace to place, let her do nothing but incessantly empty and fill into\nour belief, as into a vessel, other and other opinions; yet still the\npresent and the last is the certain and infallible one; for this we must\nabandon goods, honour, life, health, and all.\n\n\n      Posterior.... res ilia reperta\n   Perdit, et immutat sensus ad pristina qn\u00e6qne.\n\n      \u201cThe last things we find out are always best,\n   And make us to disrelish all the rest.\u201d\n\n\nWhatever is preached to us, and whatever we learn, we should still\nremember that it is man that gives and man that receives; \u2018tis a mortal\nhand that presents it to us; \u2018tis a mortal hand that accepts it The\nthings that come to us from heaven have the sole right and authority of\npersuasion, the sole mark of truth; which also we do not see with our\nown eyes, nor receive by our own means; that great and sacred image\ncould not abide in so wretched a habitation if God for this end did not\nprepare it, if God did not by his particular and supernatural grace and\nfavour fortify and reform it. At least our frail and defective condition\nought to make us behave ourselves with more reservedness and moderation\nin our innovations and changes; we ought to remember that, whatever we\nreceive into the understanding, we often receive things that are false,\nand that it is by the same instruments that so often give themselves the\nlie and are so often deceived.\n\nNow it is no wonder they should so often contradict themselves, being\nso easy to be turned and swayed by very light occurrences. It is certain\nthat our apprehensions, our judgment, and the faculties of the soul in\ngeneral, suffer according to the movements and alterations of the body,\nwhich alterations are continual. Are not our minds more sprightly, ou\u00ef\nmemories more prompt and quick, and our thoughts more lively, in health\nthan in sickness? Do not joy and gayety make us receive subjects\nthat present themselves to our souls quite otherwise than care and\nmelancholy? Do you believe that Catullus\u2019s verses, or those of Sappho,\nplease an old doting miser as they do a vigorous, amorous young man?\nCleomenes, the son of Anexandridas, being sick, his friends reproached\nhim that he had humours and whimsies that were new and unaccustomed;\n\u201cI believe it,\u201d said he; \u201cneither am I the same man now as when I am in\nhealth; being now another person, my opinions and fancies are also other\nthan they were before.\u201d In our courts of justice this word is much in\nuse, which is spoken of criminals when they find the judges in a good\nhumour, gentle, and mild, _Gaudeat de bon\u00e2 fortun\u00e2 _; \u201cLet him rejoice\nin his good fortune;\u201d for it is most certain that men\u2019s judgments are\nsometimes more prone to condemnation, more sharp and severe, and at\nothers more facile, easy, and inclined to excuse; he that carries with\nhim from his house the pain of the gout, jealousy, or theft by his man,\nhaving his whole soul possessed with anger, it is not to be doubted\nbut that his judgment will lean this way. That venerable senate of the\nAreopagites used to hear and determine by night, for fear lest the sight\nof the parties might corrupt their justice. The very air itself, and the\nserenity of heaven, will cause some mutation in us, according to these\nverses in Cicero:--\n\n\n      Tales sunt hominnm mentes, quali pater ipse\n   Jupiter auctifer\u00e2 lustravit lampade terras.\n\n      \u201cMen\u2019s minds are influenc\u2019d by th\u2019 external air,\n   Dark or serene, as days are foul or fair.\u201d\n\n\n\u2018Tis not only fevers, debauches, and great accidents, that overthrow our\njudgments,--the least things in the world will do it; and we are not to\ndoubt, though we may not be sensible of it, that if a continued fever\ncan overwhelm the soul, a tertian will in some proportionate measure\nalter it; if an apoplexy can stupefy and totally extinguish the sight of\nour understanding, we are not to doubt but that a great cold will dazzle\nit; and consequently there is hardly one single hour in a man\u2019s whole\nlife wherein our judgment is in its due place and right condition, our\nbodies being subject to so many continual mutations, and stuffed with so\nmany several sorts of springs, that I believe the physicians, that it is\nhard but that there must be always some one or other out of order.\n\nAs to what remains, this malady does not very easily discover itself,\nunless it be extreme and past remedy; forasmuch as reason goes always\nlame, halting, and that too as well with falsehood as with truth; and\ntherefore \u2018tis hard to discover her deviations and mistakes. I always\ncall that appearance of meditation which every one forges in himself\nreason; this reason, of the condition of which there may be a hundred\ncontrary ones about one and the same subject, is an instrument of lead\nand of wax, ductile, pliable, and accommodate to all sorts of biases,\nand to all measures; so that nothing remains but the art and skill how\nto turn and mould it. How uprightly soever a judge may mean, if he\ndoes not look well to himself, which few care to do, his inclination to\nfriendship, to relationship, to beauty or revenge, and not only things\nof that weight, but even the fortuitous instinct that makes us favour\none thing more than another, and that, without reason\u2019s permission, puts\nthe choice upon us in two equal subjects, or some shadow of like\nvanity, may insensibly insinuate into his judgment the recommendation or\ndisfavour of a cause, and make the balance dip.\n\nI, that watch myself as narrowly as I can, and that have my eyes\ncontinually bent upon myself, like one that has no great business to do\nelsewhere,\n\n\n      Quis sub Arcto Rex gelid\u00e6 metuatur or\u00e6,\n   Quid Tyridatem terreat, unice Securus,\n\n      \u201cI care not whom the northern clime reveres,\n   Or what\u2019s the king that Tyridates fears,\u201d\n\n\ndare hardly tell the vanity and weakness I find in myself My foot is so\nunstable and unsteady, I find myself so apt to totter and reel, and my\nsight so disordered, that, fasting, I am quite another man than when\nfull; if health and a fair day smile upon me, I am a very affable,\ngood-natured man; if a corn trouble my toe, I am sullen, out of humour,\nand not to be seen. The same pace of a horse seems to me one while\nhard, and another easy; and the same way one while shorter, and another\nlonger; and the same form one while more, another less agreeable: I am\none while for doing every thing, and another for doing nothing at all;\nand what pleases me now would be a trouble to me at another time. I\nhave a thousand senseless and casual actions within myself; either I\nam possessed by melancholy or swayed by choler; now by its own private\nauthority sadness predominates in me, and by and by, I am as merry as\na cricket. When I take a book in hand I have then discovered admirable\ngraces in such and such passages, and such as have struck my soul; let\nme light upon them at another time, I may turn and toss, tumble\nand rattle the leaves to no purpose; \u2018tis then to me an inform and\nundiscovered mass. Even in my own writings I do not always find the air\nof my first fancy; I know not what I would have said, and am often put\nto it to correct and pump for a new sense, because I have lost the first\nthat was better. I do nothing but go and come; my judgment does not\nalways advance--it floats and roams:--\n\n\n      Velut minuta magno\n   Deprensa navis in mari vesaniente vento.\n\n      \u201cLike a small bark that\u2019s tost upon the main.\n   When winds tempestuous heave the liquid plain.\u201d\n\n\nVery often, as I am apt to do, having for exercise taken to maintain an\nopinion contrary to my own, my mind, bending and applying itself that\nway, does so engage me that way that I no more discern the reason of my\nformer belief, and forsake it I am, as it were, misled by the side to\nwhich I incline, be it what it will, and carried away by my own weight.\nEvery one almost would say the same of himself, if he considered himself\nas I do. Preachers very well know that the emotions which steal upon\nthem in speaking animate them towards belief; and that in passion we\nare more warm in the defence of our proposition, take ourselves a deeper\nimpression of it, and embrace it with greater vehemence and approbation\nthan we do in our colder and more temperate state. You only give your\ncounsel a simple brief of your cause; he returns you a dubious and\nuncertain answer, by which you find him indifferent which side he takes.\nHave you feed him well that he may relish it the better, does he begin\nto be really concerned, and do you find him interested and zealous in\nyour quarrel? his reason and learning will by degrees grow hot in your\ncause; behold an apparent and undoubted truth presents itself to his\nunderstanding; he discovers a new light in your business, and does in\ngood earnest believe and persuade himself that it is so. Nay, I do not\nknow whether the ardour that springs from spite and obstinacy, against\nthe power and violence of the magistrate and danger, or the interest of\nreputation, may not have made some men, even at the stake, maintain the\nopinion for which, at liberty, and amongst friends, they would not have\nburned a finger. The shocks and jostles that the soul receives from the\nbody\u2019s passions can do much in it, but its own can do a great deal more;\nto which it is so subjected that perhaps it may be made good that it has\nno other pace and motion but from the breath of those winds, without the\nagitation of which it would be becalmed and without action, like a\nship in the middle of the sea, to which the winds hare denied\ntheir assistance. And whoever should maintain this, siding with the\nPeripatetics, would do us no great wrong, seeing it is very well known\nthat the greatest and most noble actions of the soul proceed from, and\nstand in need of, this impulse of the passions. Valour, they say,\ncannot be perfect without the assistance of anger; _Semper Ajax fortis,\nfortissimus tamen in furore;_ \u201cAjax was always brave, but most when in\na fury:\u201d neither do we encounter the wicked and the enemy vigorously\nenough if we be not angry; nay, the advocate, it is said, is to inspire\nthe judges with indignation, to obtain justice.\n\nIrregular desires moved Themistocles, and Demosthenes, and have pushed\non the philosophers to watching, fasting, and pilgrimages; and lead us\nto honour, learning, and health, which are all very useful ends. And\nthis meanness of soul, in suffering anxiety and trouble, serves to breed\nremorse and repentance in the conscience, and to make us sensible of\nthe scourge of God, and politic correction for the chastisement of\nour offences; compassion is a spur to clemency; and the prudence of\npreserving and governing ourselves is roused by our fear; and how many\nbrave actions by ambition! how many by presumption! In short, there is\nno brave and spiritual virtue without some irregular agitation. May not\nthis be one of the reasons that moved the Epicureans to discharge God\nfrom all care and solicitude of our affairs; because even the effects of\nhis goodness could not be exercised in our behalf without disturbing its\nrepose, by the means of passions which are so many spurs and instruments\npricking on the soul to virtuous actions; or have they thought\notherwise, and taken them for tempests, that shamefully hurry the soul\nfrom her tranquillity? _Ut maris tranquillitas intettigitur, null\u00e2, ne\nminima quidem, aura fluctus commovente: Sic animi quietus et placatus\nstatus cemitur, quum perturbatis nulla est, qua moveri queat.._ \u201cAs it\nis understood to be a calm sea when there is not the least breath of air\nstirring; so the state of the soul is discerned to be quiet and appeased\nwhen there is no perturbation to move it.\u201d\n\nWhat varieties of sense and reason, what contrariety of imaginations\ndoes the diversity of our passions inspire us with! What assurance then\ncan we take of a thing so mobile and unstable, subject by its condition\nto the dominion of trouble, and never going other than a forced and\nborrowed pace? If our judgment be in the power even of sickness and\nperturbation; if it be from folly and rashness that it is to receive the\nimpression of things, what security can we expect from it?\n\nIs it not a great boldness in philosophy to believe that men perform the\ngreatest actions, and nearest approaching the Divinity, when they\nare furious, mad, and beside themselves? We better ourselves by the\nprivation of our reason, and drilling it. The two natural ways to\nenter into the cabinet of the gods, and there to foresee the course of\ndestiny, are fury and sleep.\n\nThis is pleasant to consider; by the dislocation that passions cause\nin our reason, we become virtuous; by its extirpation, occasioned by\nmadness or the image of death, we become diviners and prophets. I was\nnever so willing to believe philosophy in any thing as this. \u2018Tis a pure\nenthusiasm wherewith sacred truth has inspired the spirit of philosophy,\nwhich makes it confess, contrary to its own proposition, that the most\ncalm, composed, and healthful estate ef the soul that philosophy can\nseat it in is not its best condition; our waking is more a sleep than\nsleep itself, our wisdom less wise than folly; our dreams are worth more\nthan our meditation; and the worst place we can take is in ourselves.\nBut does not philosophy think that we are wise enough to consider\nthat the voice that the spirit utters, when dismissed from man, so\nclear-sighted, so great, and so perfect, and whilst it is in man so\nterrestrial, ignorant, and dark, is a voice proceeding from the spirit\nof dark, terrestrial, and ignorant man, and for this reason a voice not\nto be trusted and believed?\n\nI, being of a soft and heavy complexion, have no great experience of\nthese vehement agitations, the most of which surprise the soul on a\nsudden, without giving it leisure to recollect itself. But the passion\nthat is said to be produced by idleness in the hearts of young men,\nthough it proceed leisurely, and with a measured progress, does\nevidently manifest, to those who have tried to oppose its power, the\nviolence our judgment suffers in this alteration and conversion. I have\nformerly attempted to withstand and repel it; for I am so far from being\none of those that invite vices, that I do not so much as follow them, if\nthey do not haul me along; I perceived it to spring, grow, and increase,\nin spite of my resistance; and at last, living and seeing as I was,\nwholly to seize and possess me. So that, as if rousing from drunkenness,\nthe images of things began to appear to me quite other than they used\nto be; I evidently saw the advantages of the object I desired, grow,\nand increase, and expand by the influence of my imagination, and the\ndifficulties of my attempt to grow more easy and smooth; and both my\nreason and conscience to be laid aside; but this fire being evaporated\nin an instant, as from a flash of lightning, I was aware that my soul\nresumed another kind of sight, another state, and another judgment;\nthe difficulties of retreat appeared great and invincible, and the same\nthings had quite another taste and aspect than the heat of desire had\npresented them to me; which of the two most truly? Pyrrho knows nothing\nabout it. We are never without sickness. Agues have their hot and cold\nfits; from the effects of an ardent passion we fall again to shivering;\nas much as I had advanced, so much I retired:--\n\n\n      Qualis ubi alterno procurrens gurgite pontus,\n   Nunc ruit ad terras, scopulosque superjacit undam\n   Spumeus, extremamque sinu perfundit arenam;\n   Nunc rapidus retro, atque \u00e6stu revoluta resorbens\n   Saxa, fugit, littusque vado labente relihquit.\n\n      \u201cSo swelling surges, with a thundering roar,\n   Driv\u2019n on each others\u2019 backs, insult the shore,\n   Bound o\u2019er the rocks, encroach upon the land,\n   And far upon the beach heave up the sand;\n   Then backward rapidly they take their way,\n   Repulsed from upper ground, and seek the sea.\u201d\n\n\nNow, from the knowledge of this volubility of mine, I have accidentally\nbegot in myself a certain constancy of opinions, and have not much\naltered those that were first and natural in me; for what appearance\nsoever there may be in novelty, I do not easily change, for fear of\nlosing by the bargain; and, as I am not capable of choosing, I take\nother men\u2019s choice, and keep myself in the station wherein God has\nplaced me; I could not otherwise keep myself from perpetual rolling.\nThus have I, by the grace of God, preserved myself entire, without\nanxiety or trouble of conscience, in the ancient faith of our religion,\namidst so many sects and divisions as our age has produced. The writings\nof the ancients, the best authors I mean, being full and solid, tempt\nand carry me which way almost they will; he that I am reading seems\nalways to have the most force; and I find that every one in his turn is\nin the right, though they contradict one another. The facility that good\nwits have of rendering every thing likely they would recommend, and\nthat nothing is so strange to which they do not undertake to give colour\nenough to deceive such simplicity as mine, this evidently shows the\nweakness of their testimony. The heavens and the stars have been\nthree thousand years in motion; all the world were of that belief\ntill Cleanthes the Samian, or, according to Theophrastus, Nicetas of\nSyracuse, took it into his head to maintain that it was the earth that\nmoved, turning about its axis by the oblique circle of the zodiac.\nAnd Copernicus has in our times so grounded this doctrine that it very\nregularly serves to all astrological consequences; what use can we\nmake of this, if not that we ought not much to care which is the true\nopinion? And who knows but that a third, a thousand years hence, may\nover throw the two former.\n\n\n      Sic volvenda \u00e6tas commut\u00e2t tempora rerum:\n   Quod fuit in pretio, fit nullo denique honore;\n   Porro aliud succedit, et e contemptibus exit,\n   Inque dies magis appetitur, floretque repertum\n   Laudibus, et miro est mortales inter honore.\n\n      \u201cThus ev\u2019ry thing is changed in course of time,\n   What now is valued passes soon its prime;\n   To which some other thing, despised before,\n   Succeeds, and grows in vogue still more and more;\n   And once received, too faint all praises seem,\n   So highly it is rais\u2019d in men\u2019s esteem.\u201d\n\n\nSo that when any new doctrine presents itself to us, we have great\nreason to mistrust, and to consider that, before that was set on foot,\nthe contrary had been generally received; and that, as that has been\noverthrown by this, a third invention, in time to come, may start\nup which may damn the second. Before the principles that Aristotle\nintroduced were in reputation, other principles contented human reason,\nas these satisfy us now. What patent have these people, what particular\nprivilege, that the career of our invention must be stopped by them, and\nthat the possession of our whole future belief should belong to them?\nThey are no more exempt from being thrust out of doors than their\npredecessors were. When any one presses me with a new argument, I ought\nto believe that what I cannot answer another can; for to believe all\nlikelihoods that a man cannot confute is great simplicity; it would\nby that means come to pass that all the vulgar (and we are all of the\nvulgar) would have their belief as tumable as a weathercock; for their\nsouls, being so easy to be imposed upon, and without any resistance,\nmust of force incessantly receive other and other impressions, the last\nstill effacing all footsteps of that which went before. He that finds\nhimself weak ought to answer, according to practice, that he will speak\nwith his counsel, or refer himself to the wiser, from whom he received\nhis instruction. How long is it that physic has been practised in the\nworld? \u2018Tis said that a new comer, called Paracelsus, changes and\noverthrows the whole order of ancient rules, and maintains that, till\nnow, it has been of no other use but to kill men. I believe he will\neasily make this good, but I do not think it were wisdom to venture my\nlife in making trial of his own experience. We are not to believe every\none, says the precept, because every one can say all things. A man of\nthis profession of novelties and physical reformations not long since\ntold me that all the ancients were notoriously mistaken in the nature\nand motions of the winds, which he would evidently demonstrate to me if\nI would give him the hearing. After I had with some patience heard his\narguments, which were all full of likelihood of truth: \u201cWhat, then,\u201d\n said I, \u201cdid those that sailed according to Theophrastus make way\nwestward, when they had the prow towards the east? did they go sideward\nor backward?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s fortune,\u201d answered he, \u201cbut so it is that they\nwere mistaken.\u201d I replied that I had rather follow effects than reason.\nNow these are things that often interfere with one another, and I have\nbeen told that in geometry (which pretends to have gained the highest\npoint of certainty of all science) there are inevitable demonstrations\nfound which subvert the truth of all experience; as Jacques Pelletier\ntold me, at my own house, that he had found out two lines stretching\nthemselves one towards the other to meet, which nevertheless he\naffirmed, though extended to infinity, could never arrive to touch one\nanother. And the Pyrrhonians make no other use of their arguments and\ntheir reason than to ruin the appearance of experience; and \u2018tis a\nwonder how far the suppleness of our reason has followed them in this\ndesign of controverting the evidence of effects; for they affirm that we\ndo not move, that we do not speak, and that there is neither weight nor\nheat, with the same force of argument that we affirm the most likely\nthings. Ptolemy, who was a great man, had established the bounds of this\nworld of ours; all the ancient philosophers thought they had the measure\nof it, excepting some remote isles that might escape their knowledge;\nit had been Pyrrhonism, a thousand years ago, to doubt the science of\ncosmography, and the opinions that every one had received from it; it\nwas heresy to admit the antipodes; and behold, in this age of ours,\nthere is an infinite extent of terra firma discovered, not an island or\nsingle country, but a division of the world, nearly equal in greatness\nto that we knew before. The geographers of our time stick not to assure\nus that now all is found; all is seen:--\n\n\n   Nam quod adest prosto, placet, et pollere videtur;\n\n   \u201cWhat\u2019s present pleases, and appears the best;\u201d\n\n\nbut it remains to be seen whether, as Ptolemy was therein formerly\ndeceived upon the foundation of his reason, it were not very foolish to\ntrust now in what these people say? And whether it is not more likely\nthat this great body, which we call the world, is not quite another\nthing than what we imagine.\n\nPlato says that it changes countenance in all respects; that the\nheavens, the stars, and the sun, have all of them sometimes motions\nretrograde to what we see, changing east into west The Egyptian priests\ntold Herodotus that from the time of their first king, which was eleven\nthousand and odd years since (and they showed him the effigies of all\ntheir kings in statues taken from the life), the sun had four times\naltered his course; that the sea and the earth did alternately change\ninto one another; that the beginning of the world is undetermined;\nAristotle and Cicero both say the same; and some amongst us are of\nopinion that it has been from all eternity, is mortal, and renewed again\nby several vicissitudes; calling Solomon and Isaiah to witness; to evade\nthose oppositions, that God has once been a creator without a creature;\nthat he has had nothing to do, that he got rid of that idleness by\nputting his hand to this work; and that consequently he is subject to\nchange. In the most famous of the Greek schools the world is taken for a\ngod, made by another god greater than he, and composed of a body, and a\nsoul fixed in his centre, and dilating himself by musical numbers to\nhis circumference; divine, infinitely happy, and infinitely great,\ninfinitely wise and eternal; in him are other gods, the sea, the earth,\nthe stars, who entertain one another with an harmonious and perpetual\nagitation and divine dance, sometimes meeting, sometimes retiring from\none another; concealing and discovering themselves; changing their\norder, one while before, and another behind. Heraclitus was positive\nthat the world was composed of fire; and, by the order of destiny,\nwas one day to be enflamed and consumed in fire, and then to be again\nrenewed. And Apuleius says of men: _Sigillatim mortales, cunctim\nperpetui._ \u201cThat they are mortal in particular, and immortal in\ngeneral.\u201d Alexander writ to his mother the narration of an Egyptian\npriest, drawn from their monuments, testifying the antiquity of that\nnation to be infinite, and comprising the birth and progress of other\ncountries. Cicero and Diodorus say that in their time the Chaldees kept\na register of four hundred thousand and odd years, Aristotle, Pliny,\nand others, that Zoroaster flourished six thousand years before Plato\u2019s\ntime. Plato says that they of the city of Sais have records in writing\nof eight thousand years; and that the city of Athens was built a\nthousand years before the said city of Sais; Epicurus, that at the same\ntime things are here in the posture we see, they are alike and in the\nsame manner in several other worlds; which he would have delivered with\ngreater assurance, had he seen the similitude and concordance of the new\ndiscovered world of the West Indies with ours, present and past, in so\nmany strange examples.\n\nIn earnest, considering what is come to our knowledge from the course\nof this terrestrial polity, I have often wondered to see in so vast a\ndistance of places and times such a concurrence of so great a number of\npopular and wild opinions, and of savage manners and beliefs, which by\nno means seem to proceed from our natural meditation. The human mind is\na great worker of miracles! But this relation has, moreover, I know\nnot what of extraordinary in it; \u2018tis found to be in names, also, and a\nthousand other things; for they found nations there (that, for aught we\nknow, never heard of us) where circumcision was in use; where there were\nstates and great civil governments maintained by women only, without\nmen; where our fasts and Lent were represented, to which was added\nabstinence from women; where our crosses were several ways in repute;\nhere they were made use of to honour and adorn their sepultures, there\nthey were erected, and particularly that of St Andrew, to protect\nthemselves from nocturnal visions, and to lay upon the cradles of\ninfants against enchantments; elsewhere there was found one of wood,\nof very great height, which was adored for the god of rain, and this\na great way in the interior; there was seen an express image of our\npenance priests, the use of mitres, the celibacy of priests, the art\nof divination by the entrails of sacrificed beasts, abstinence from all\nsorts of flesh and fish in their diet, the manner of priests officiating\nin a particular and not a vulgar language; and this fancy, that the\nfirst god was driven away by a second, his younger brother; that they\nwere created with all sorts of necessaries and conveniences, which have\nsince been in a degree taken from them for their sins, their territory\nchanged, and their natural condition made worse; that they were of\nold overwhelmed by the inundation of water from heaven; that but few\nfamilies escaped, who retired into caves on high mountains, the mouths\nof which they stopped so that the waters could not get in, having shut\nup, together with themselves, several sorts of animals; that when they\nperceived the rain to cease they sent out dogs, which returning clean\nand wet, they judged that the water was not much abated; afterwards\nsending out others, and seeing them return dirty, they issued out to\nrepeople the world, which they found only full of serpents. In one place\nwe met with the belief of a day of judgment; insomuch that they were\nmarvellously displeased at the Spaniards for discomposing the bones of\nthe dead, in rifling the sepultures for riches, saying that those bones\nso disordered could not easily rejoin; the traffic by exchange, and no\nother way; fairs and markets for that end; dwarfs and deformed people\nfor the ornament of the tables of princes; the use of falconry,\naccording to the nature of their hawks; tyrannical subsidies; nicety in\ngardens; dancing, tumbling tricks, music of instruments, coats of arms,\ntennis-courts, dice and lotteries, wherein they are sometimes so eager\nand hot as to stake themselves and their liberty; physic, no otherwise\nthan by charms; the way of writing in cypher; the belief of only one\nfirst man, the father of all nations; the adoration of one God, who\nformerly lived a man in perfect virginity, fasting, and penitence,\npreaching the laws of nature, and the ceremonies of religion, and that\nvanished from the world without a natural death; the theory of giants;\nthe custom of making themselves drunk with their beverages, and drinking\nto the utmost; religious ornaments painted with bones and dead men\u2019s\nskulls; surplices, holy water sprinkled; wives and servants, who present\nthemselves with emulation, burnt and interred with the dead husband or\nmaster; a law by which the eldest succeeds to all the estate, no\npart being left for the younger but obedience; the custom that, upon\npromotion to a certain office of great authority, the promoted is to\ntake upon him a new name, and to leave that which he had before; another\nto strew lime upon the knee of the new-born child, with these words:\n\n\u201cFrom dust thou earnest, and to dust thou must return;\u201d as also the art\nof augury. The vain shadows of our religion, which are observable in\nsome of these examples, are testimonies of its dignity and divinity. It\nis not only in some sort insinuated into all the infidel nations on this\nside of the world, by a certain imitation, but in these barbarians\nalso, as by a common and supernatural inspiration; for we find there the\nbelief of purgatory, but of a new form; that which we give to the fire\nthey give to the cold, and imagine that souls are purged and punished by\nthe rigour of an excessive coldness. And this example puts me in mind\nof another pleasant diversity; for as there were there some people who\ndelighted to unmuffle the ends of their instruments, and clipped off\nthe prepuce after the Mahometan and Jewish manner; there were others who\nmade so great conscience of laying it bare, that they carefully pursed\nit up with little strings to keep that end from peeping into the air;\nand of this other diversity, that whereas we, to honour kings and\nfestivals, put on the best clothes we have; in some regions, to express\ntheir disparity and submission to their king, his subjects present\nthemselves before him in their vilest habits, and entering his palace,\nthrow some old tattered garment over their better apparel, to the end\nthat all the lustre and ornament may solely be in him. But to proceed:--\n\nIf nature enclose within the bounds of her ordinary progress the\nbeliefs, judgments, and opinions of men, as well as all other things;\nif they have their revolution, their season, their birth and death, like\ncabbage plants; if the heavens agitate and rule them at their pleasure,\nwhat magisterial and permanent authority do we attribute to them? If\nwe experimentally see that the form of our beings depends upon the air,\nupon the climate, and upon the soil, where we are bom, and not only the\ncolour, the stature, the complexion, and the countenances, but moreover\nthe very faculties of the soul itself: Et plaga codi non solum ad robor\ncorporum, sed etiam anirum facit: \u201cThe climate is of great efficacy,\nnot only to the strength of bodies, but to that of souls also,\u201d says\nVegetius; and that the goddess who founded the city of Athens chose\nto situate it in a temperature of air fit to make men prudent, as\nthe Egyptian priests told Solon: _Athenis tenue colum; ex quo etiam\nacutiores putantur Attici; crassum Thebis; itaque pingues Thebani,\net valentes:_ \u201cThe air of Athens is subtle and thin; whence also the\nAthenians are reputed to be more acute; and at Thebes more gross and\nthick; wherefore the Thebans are looked upon as more heavy-witted and\nmore strong.\u201d In such sort that, as fruits and animals grow different,\nmen are also more or less warlike, just, temperate, and docile; here\ngiven to wine, elsewhere to theft or uncleanness; here inclined to\nsuperstition, elsewhere to unbelief; in one place to liberty, in another\nto servitude; capable of one science or of one art, dull or ingenious,\nobedient or mutinous, good or bad, according as the place where they\nare seated inclines them; and assume a new complexion, if removed, like\ntrees, which was the reason why Cyrus would not grant the Persians\nleave to quit their rough and craggy country to remove to another\nmore pleasant and even, saying, that fertile and tender soils made\nmen effeminate and soft. If we see one while one art and one belief\nflourish, and another while another, through some celestial influence;\nsuch an age to produce such natures, and to incline mankind to such and\nsuch a propension, the spirits of men one while gay and another gray,\nlike our fields, what becomes of all those fine prerogatives we so\nsoothe ourselves withal? Seeing that a wise man may be mistaken, and a\nhundred men and a hundred nations, nay, that even human nature\nitself, as we believe, is many ages wide in one thing or another, what\nassurances have we that she should cease to be mistaken, or that in this\nvery age of ours she is not so?\n\nMethinks that amongst other testimonies of our imbecility, this ought\nnot to be forgotten, that man cannot, by his own wish and desire, find\nout what he wants; that not in fruition only, but in imagination and\nwish, we cannot agree about what we would have to satisfy and content\nus. Let us leave it to our own thought to cut out and make up at\npleasure; it cannot so much as covet what is proper for it, and satisfy\nitself:--\n\n\n      Quid enim ratione timemus,\n   Aut cupimus? Quid tain dextro pede concipis, ut te\n   Conatus non poniteat, votique peracti?\n\n      \u201cFor what, with reason, do we speak or shun,\n   What plan, how happily soe\u2019r begun,\n   That, when achieved, we do not wish undone?\u201d\n\n\nAnd therefore it was that Socrates only begged of the gods that they\nwould give him what they knew to be best for him; and the private\nand public prayer of the Lacedemonians was simply for good and useful\nthings, referring the choice and election of them to the discretion of\nthe Supreme Power:--\n\n\n      Conjugium petimus, partumqu\u00e9 uxoris; at illis\n   Notum, qui pueri, qualisque futura sit uxor:\n\n      \u201cWe ask for Wives and children; they above\n   Know only, when we have them, what they\u2019ll prove;\u201d\n\n\nand Christians pray to God, \u201cThy will be done,\u201d that they may not fall\ninto the inconvenience the poet feigns of King Midas. He prayed to\nthe gods that all he touched might be turned into gold; his prayer was\nheard; his wine was gold, his bread was gold, the feathers of his\nbed, his shirt, his clothes, were all gold, so that he found himself\noverwhelmed with the fruition of his desire, and endowed with an\nintolerable benefit, and was fain to unpray his prayers.\n\n\n      Attonitus novitate mali, divesque, miserque,\n   Effugere opt\u00e2t opes, et, qu\u00e6 modo voverat, odit.\n\n      \u201cAstonished at the strangeness of the ill,\n   To be so rich, yet miserable still;\n   He wishes now he could his wealth evade,\n   And hates the thing for which before he prayed.\u201d\n\n\nTo instance in myself: being young, I desired of fortune, above all\nthings, the order of St. Michael, which was then the utmost distinction\nof honour amongst the French nobles, and very rare. She pleasantly\ngratified my longing; instead of raising me, and lifting me up from my\nown place to attain to it, she was much kinder to me; for she brought it\nso low, and made it so cheap, that it stooped down to my shoulders, and\nlower. Cleobis and Bito, Trophonius and Agamedes, having requested, the\nfirst of their goddess, the last of their god, a recompense worthy of\ntheir piety, had death for a reward; so differing from ours are heavenly\nopinions concerning what is fit for us. God might grant us riches,\nhonours, life, and even health, to our own hurt; for every thing that\nis pleasing to us is not always good for us. If he sends us death, or\nan increase of sickness, instead of a cure, _Vvrga tua et baculus, tuus\nipsa me consolata sunt._ \u201cThy rod and thy staff have comforted me,\u201d he\ndoes it by the rule of his providence, which better and more certainly\ndiscerns what is proper for us than we can do; and we ought to take it\nin good part, as coming from a wise and most friendly hand\n\n\n      Si consilium vis:\n   Permittee ipsis expendere numinibus, quid\n   Conveniat nobis, rebusque sit utile nostris...\n   Carior est illis homo quam sibi;\n\n      \u201cIf thou\u2019lt be rul\u2019d, to th\u2019 gods thy fortunes trust,\n   Their thoughts are wise, their dispensations just.\n   What best may profit or delight they know,\n   And real good, for fancied bliss, bestow;\n   With eyes of pity, they our frailties scan,\n   More dear to them, than to himself, is man;\u201d\n\n\nfor to require of him honours and commands, is to require \u2018that he may\nthrow you into a battle, set you upon a cast at dice, or something of\nthe like nature, whereof the issue is to you unknown, and the fruit\ndoubtful.\n\nThere is no dispute so sharp and violent amongst the philosophers,\nas about the question of the sovereign good of man; whence, by the\ncalculation of Varro, rose two hundred and eighty-eight sects. _Qui\nautem de summo bono dissentit, de tot\u00e2 philosophies ratione disput\u00e2t._\n\u201cFor whoever enters into controversy concerning the supreme good,\ndisputes upon the whole matter of philosophy.\u201d\n\n\n      Tr\u00e8s mihi conviv\u00e6 prope dissentire videntur,\n   Poscentes vario mul turn divers a palato;\n   Quid dem? Quid non dem? Renuis tu quod jubet alter;\n   Quod petis, id sane est invisum acidumque duobus;\n\n      \u201cI have three guests invited to a feast,\n   And all appear to have a different taste;\n   What shall I give them? What shall I refuse?\n   What one dislikes the other two shall choose;\n   And e\u2019en the very dish you like the best\n   Is acid or insipid to the rest:\u201d\n\n\nnature should say the same to their contests and debates. Some say that\nour well-being lies in virtue, others in pleasure, others in submitting\nto nature; one in knowledge, another in being exempt from pain, another\nin not suffering ourselves to be carried away by appearances; and this\nfancy seems to have some relation to that of the ancient Pythagoras,\n\n\n      Nil admirari, prope res est una, Numici,\n   Solaque, qu\u00e6 possit facere et servare beatum:\n\n      \u201cNot to admire\u2019s the only art I know\n   Can make us happy, and can keep us so;\u201d\n\n\nwhich is the drift of the Pyrrhonian sect; Aristotle attributes the\nadmiring nothing to magnanimity; and Arcesilaus said, that constancy and\na right inflexible state of judgment were the true good, and consent\nand application the sin and evil; and there, it is true, in being thus\npositive, and establishing a certain axiom, he quitted Pyrrhonism; for\nthe\u2019 Pyrrhonians, when they say that ataraxy, which is the immobility\nof judgment, is the sovereign good, do not design to speak it\naffirmatively; but that the same motion of soul which makes them avoid\nprecipices, and take shelter from the cold, presents them such a fancy,\nand makes them refuse another.\n\nHow much do I wish that, whilst I live, either some other or Justus\nLipsius, the most learned man now living, of a most polite and judicious\nunderstanding, truly resembling my Turnebus, had both the will and\nhealth, and leisure sufficient, carefully and conscientiously to collect\ninto a register, according to their divisions and classes, as many as\nare to be found, of the opinions of the ancient philosophers, about the\nsubject of our being and manners, their controversies, the succession\nand reputation of sects; with the application of the lives of the\nauthors and their disciples to their own precepts, in memorable\naccidents, and upon exemplary occasions. What a beautiful and useful\nwork that would be!\n\nAs to what remains, if it be from ourselves that we are to extract the\nrules of our manners, upon what a confusion do we throw ourselves! For\nthat which our reason advises us to, as the most likely, is generally\nfor every one to obey the laws of his country, as was the advice of\nSocrates, inspired, as he says, by a divine counsel; and by that,\nwhat would it say, but that our duty has no other rule but what is\naccidental? Truth ought to have a like and universal visage; if man\ncould know equity and justice that had a body and a true being, he would\nnot fetter it to the conditions of this country or that; it would not be\nfrom the whimsies of the Persians or Indians that virtue would receive\nits form. There is nothing more subject to perpetual agitation than\nthe laws; since I was born, I have known those of the English, our\nneighbours, three or four times changed, not only in matters of civil\nregimen, which is the only thing wherein constancy may be dispensed\nwith, but in the most important subject that can be, namely, religion,\nat which I am the more troubled and ashamed, because it is a nation with\nwhom those of my province have formerly had so great familiarity and\nacquaintance, that there yet remains in my house some footsteps of our\nancient kindred; and here with us at home, I have known a thing that\nwas capital to become lawful; and we that hold of others are likewise,\naccording to the chance of war, in a possibility of being one day found\nguilty of high-treason, both divine and human, should the justice of\nour arms fall into the power of injustice, and, after a few years\u2019\npossession, take a quite contrary being. How could that ancient god more\nclearly accuse the ignorance of human knowledge concerning the divine\nBeing, and give men to understand that their religion was but a thing of\ntheir own contrivance, useful as a bond to their society, than declaring\nas he did to those who came to his tripod for instruction, that every\none\u2019s true worship was that which he found in use in the place where he\nchanced to be? O God, what infinite obligation have we to the bounty\nof our sovereign Creator, for having disabused our belief from these\nwandering and arbitrary devotions, and for having seated it upon the\neternal foundation of his holy word? But what then will philosophers say\nto us in this necessity? \u201cThat we follow the laws of our country;\u201d that\nis to say, this floating sea of the opinions of a republic, or a prince,\nthat will paint out justice for me in as many colours, and form it\nas many ways as there are changes of passions in themselves; I cannot\nsuffer my judgment to be so flexible. What kind of virtue is that which\nI see one day in repute, and that to-morrow shall be in none, and which\nthe crossing of a river makes a crime? What sort of truth can that\nbe, which these mountains limit to us, and make a lie to all the world\nbeyond them?\n\nBut they are pleasant, when, to give some certainty to the laws, they\nsay, that there are some firm, perpetual, and immovable, which they call\nnatural, that are imprinted in human kind by the condition of their own\nproper being; and of these some reckon three, some four, some more, some\nless; a sign that it is a mark as doubtful as the rest Now they are so\nunfortunate, (for what can I call it else but misfortune that, of so\ninfinite a number of laws, there should not be found one at least\nthat fortune and the temerity of chance has suffered to be universally\nreceived by the consent of all nations?) they are, I say, so miserable,\nthat of these three or four select laws, there is not so much as one\nthat is not contradicted and disowned, not only by one nation, but by\nmany. Now, the only likely sign, by which they can argue or infer some\nnatural laws, is the universality of approbation; for we should, without\ndoubt, follow with a common consent that which nature had truly ordained\nus; and not only every nation, but every private man, would resent the\nforce and violence that any one should do him who would tempt him to\nany thing contrary to this law. But let them produce me one of this\ncondition. Proctagoras and Aristo gave no other essence to the justice\nof laws than the authority and opinion of the legislator; and that,\nthese laid aside, the honest and the good lost their qualities, and\nremained empty names of indifferent things; Thrasymachus, in Plato,\nis of opinion that there is no other right but the convenience of the\nsuperior. There is not any thing wherein the world is so various as in\nlaws and customs; such a thing is abominable here which is elsewhere in\nesteem, as in Lacedemon dexterity in stealing; marriages between near\nrelations, are capitally interdicted amongst us; they are elsewhere in\nhonour:--\n\n\n      Gentes esse ferantur,\n   In quibus et nato genitrix, et nata parenti\n   Jungitur, et pietas geminato crescit amore;\n\n      \u201cThere are some nations in the world, \u2018tis said,\n   Where fathers daughters, sons their mothers wed;\n   And their affections thereby higher rise,\n   More firm and constant by these double ties;\u201d\n\n\nthe murder of infants, the murder of fathers, the community of wives,\ntraffic of robberies, license in all sorts of voluptuousness; in short,\nthere is nothing so extreme that is not allowed by the custom of some\nnation or other.\n\nIt is credible that there are natural laws for us, as we see them\nin other creatures; but they are lost in us, this fine human reason\neverywhere so insinuating itself to govern and command, as to shuffle\nand confound the face of things, according to its own vanity and\ninconstancy: _Nihil itaque amplius nostrum est; quod nostrum dico,\nartis est:_ \u201cTherefore nothing is any more truly ours; what we call ours\nbelongs to art.\u201d Subjects have divers lustres and divers considerations,\nand thence the diversity of opinions principally proceeds; one nation\nconsiders a subject in one aspect, and stops there: another takes it in\na different point of view.\n\nThere is nothing of greater horror to be imagined than for a man to eat\nhis father; and yet the people, whose ancient custom it was so to do,\nlooked upon it as a testimony of piety and affection, seeking thereby to\ngive their progenitors the most worthy and honourable sepulture; storing\nup in themselves, and as it were in their own marrow, the bodies\nand relics of their fathers; and in some sort regenerating them by\ntransmutation into their living flesh, by means of nourishment and\ndigestion. It is easy to consider what a cruelty and abomination it\nmust have appeared to men possessed and imbued with this snperstition\nto throw their fathers\u2019 remains to the corruption of the earth, and the\nnourishment of beasts and worms.\n\nLycurgus considered in theft the vivacity, diligence, boldness, and\ndexterity of purloining any thing from our neighbours, and the benefit\nthat redounded to the public that every one should look more narrowly\nto the conservation of what was his own; and believed that, from this\ndouble institution of assaulting and defending, advantage was to be made\nfor military discipline (which was the principal science and virtue to\nwhich he would inure that nation), of greater consideration than the\ndisorder and injustice of taking another man\u2019s goods.\n\nDionysius, the tyrant, offered Plato a robe of the Persian fashion,\nlong, damasked, and perfumed; Plato refused it, saying, \u201cThat being\nborn a man, he would not willingly dress himself in women\u2019s clothes;\u201d\n but Aristippus accepted it with this answer, \u201cThat no accoutrement could\ncorrupt a chaste courage.\u201d His friends reproaching him with meanness of\nspirit, for laying it no more to heart that Dionysius had spit in his\nface, \u201cFishermen,\u201d said he, \u201csuffer themselves to be drenched with the\nwaves of the sea from head to foot to catch a gudgeon.\u201d Diogenes was\nwashing cabbages, and seeing him pass by, \u201cIf thou couldst live on\ncabbage,\u201d said he, \u201cthou wouldst not fawn upon a tyrant;\u201d to whom\nAristippus replied, \u201cAnd if thou knewest how to live amongst men, thou\nwouldst not be washing cabbages.\u201d Thus reason finds appearances for\ndivers effects; \u2018tis a pot with two ears that a man may take by the\nright or left:--\n\n\n      Bellum, o terra hospita, portas:\n   Bello armantur eqni; bellum h\u00e6c armenta minantur.\n   Sed tamen idem olim curru succedere sueti\n   Quadrupedes, et frena jugo concordia ferre;\n   Spes est pacis.\n\n      \u201cWar, war is threatened from this foreign ground\n   (My father cried), where warlike steeds are found.\n   Yet, since reclaimed, to chariots they submit,\n   And bend to stubborn yokes, and champ the bit,\n   Peace may succeed to war.\u201d\n\n\nSolon, being lectured by his friends not to shed powerless and\nunprofitable tears for the death of his son, \u201cIt is for that reason that\nI the more justly shed them,\u201d said he, \u201cbecause they are powerless\nand unprofitable.\u201d Socrates\u2019s wife exasperated her grief by this\ncircumstance: \u201cOh, how unjustly do these wicked judges put him to\ndeath!\u201d \u201cWhy,\u201d replied he, \u201chadst thou rather they should execute me\njustly?\u201d We have our ears bored; the Greeks looked upon that as a mark\nof slavery. We retire in private to enjoy our wives; the Indians do it\nin public. The Scythians immolated strangers in their temples; elsewhere\ntemples were a refuge:--\n\n\n      Inde furor vulgi, quod numina vicinorum\n   Odit quisque locus, cum solos credat habendos\n   Esse deos, quos ipse colit.\n\n      \u201cThus \u2018tis the popular fury that creates\n   That all their neighbours\u2019 gods each nation hates;\n   Each thinks its own the genuine; in a word,\n   The only deities to be adored.\u201d\n\n\nI have heard of a judge who, coming upon a sharp conflict betwixt\nBartolus and Aldus, and some point controverted with many contrarieties,\nwrit in the margin of his book, \u201ca question for a friend;\u201d that is to\nsay, that truth was there so controverted and disputed that in a like\ncause he might favour which of the parties he thought fit \u2018Twas only for\nwant of wit that he did not write \u201ca question for a friend\u201d throughout.\nThe advocates and judges of our times find bias enough in all causes\nto accommodate them to what they themselves think fit. In so infinite\na science, depending upon the authority of so many opinions, and so\narbitrary a subject, it cannot be but that of necessity an extreme\nconfusion of judgments must arise; there is hardly any suit so clear\nwherein opinions do not very much differ; what one court has determined\none way another determines quite contrary, and itself contrary to that\nat another time. Of which we see very frequent examples, owing to that\npractice admitted amongst us, and which is a marvellous blemish to the\nceremonious authority and lustre of our justice, of not abiding by one\nsentence, but running from judge to judge, and court to court, to decide\none and the same cause.\n\nAs to the liberty of philosophical opinions concerning vice and virtue,\n\u2018tis not necessary to be insisted upon; therein are found many opinions\nthat are better concealed than published to weak minds. Arcesilaus said,\n\u201cThat in venery it was no matter where, or with whom, it was committed:\u201d\n _Et obsccenas voluptates, si natura requirit, non genere, aut loco, aut\nordine, sed forma, otate, jigur\u00e2, metiendas Epicurus putat.... ne amores\nquidem sanctos a sapiente alienos esse arbitrantur.... Queeramus, ad\nquam usque otatem juvenes amandi sint._ \u201cAnd obscene pleasures, if\nnature requires them,\u201d Epicurus thinks, \u201care not to be measured either\nby race, kind, place, or rank, but by age, shape, and beauty.... Neither\nare sacred loves thought to be foreign to wise men;... we are to\ninquire till what age young men are to be loved.\u201d These last two stoical\nquotations, and the reproach that Dic\u00e6archus threw into the teeth of\nPlato himself, upon this account, show how much the soundest philosophy\nindulges licenses and excesses very remote from common custom.\n\nLaws derive their authority from possession and custom. \u2018Tis dangerous\nto trace them back to their beginning; they grow great, and ennoble\nthemselves, like our rivers, by running on; but follow them upward to\ntheir source, \u2018tis but a little spring, scarce discernable,\n\nthat swells thus, and thus fortifies itself by growing old. Do but\nconsult the ancient considerations that gave the first motion to this\nfamous torrent, so full of dignity, awe, and reverence, you will find\nthem so light and weak that it is no wonder if these people, who weigh\nand reduce every thing to reason, and who admit nothing by authority, or\nupon trust, have their judgments often very remote, and differing from\nthose of the public. It is no wonder if people, who take their pattern\nfrom the first image of nature, should in most of their opinions swerve\nfrom the common path; as, for example, few amongst them would have\napproved of the strict conditions of our marriages, and most of them\nhave been for having wives in common, and without obligation; they would\nrefuse our ceremonies. Chrysippus said, \u201cThat a philosopher would make\na dozen somersaults, aye, and without his breeches, for a dozen of\nolives.\u201d That philosopher would hardly have advised Clisthenes to have\nrefused Hippoclides the fair Agarista his daughter, for having seen him\nstand on his head upon a table. Metrocles somewhat indiscreetly broke\nwind backwards while in disputation, in the presence of a great auditory\nin his school, and kept himself hid in his own house for shame, till\nCrates coming to visit him, and adding to his consolations and reasons\nthe example of his own liberty, by falling to try with him who should\nsound most, cured him of that scruple, and withal drew him to his own\nstoical sect, more free than that more reserved one of the Peripatetics,\nof which he had been till then. That which we call decency, not to dare\nto do that in public which is decent enough to do in private, the Stoics\ncall foppery; and to mince it, and to be so modest as to conceal and\ndisown what nature, custom, and our desires publish and proclaim of our\nactions, they reputed a vice. The other thought it was to undervalue the\nmysteries of Venus to draw them out of the private oratory, to expose\nthem to the view of the people; and that to bring them out from behind\nthe curtain was to debase them. Modesty is a thing of weight; secrecy,\nreservation, and circumspection, are parts of esteem. Pleasure did\nvery ingeniously when, under the mask of virtue, she sued not to be\nprostituted in the open streets, trodden under foot, and exposed to\nthe public view, wanting the dignity and convenience of her private\ncabinets. Hence some say that to put down public stews is not only to\ndisperse fornication into all places, that was confined to one, but\nmoreover, by the difficulty, to incite wild and idle people to this\nvice:--\n\n\n      Mochus es Aufidi\u00e6, qui vir,\n   Sc\u00e6vine, fuisti:\n   Rivalis fuerat qui tuus, ille vir est.\n   Cur ali\u00e9na placet tibi, qu\u00e6 tua non placet uxor?\n   Numquid securus non potes arrigere?\n\n\nThis experience diversifies itself in a thousand examples:--\n\n\n      Nullus in urbe fuit tot\u00e2, qui tangere vellet\n   Uxorem gratis, C\u00e6ciliane, tuam,\n   Dum licuit: sed nunc, positis custodibus, ingens\n   Turba fututorum est. Ingeniosus homo es.\n\n\nA philosopher being taken in the very act, and asked what he was doing,\ncoldly replied, \u201cI am planting man;\u201d no more blushing to be so caught\nthan if they had found him planting garlic.\n\nIt is, I suppose, out of tenderness and respect to the natural modesty\nof mankind that a great and religious author is of opinion that this act\nis so necessarily obliged to privacy and shame that he cannot persuade\nhimself there could be any absolute performance in those impudent\nembraces of the Cynics, but that they contented themselves to represent\nlascivious gestures only, to maintain the impudence of their school\u2019s\nprofession; and that, to eject what shame had withheld and restrained,\nit was afterward necessary for them to withdraw into the shade. But he\nhad not thoroughly examined their debauches; for Diogenes, playing the\nbeast with himself in public, wished, in the presence of all that saw\nhim, that he could fill his belly by that exercise. To those who asked\nhim why he did not find out a more commodious place to eat in than\nin the open street, he made answer, \u201cBecause I am hungry in the open\nstreet.\u201d The women philosophers who mixed with their sect, mixed also\nwith their persons, in all places, without reservation; and Hipparchia\nwas not received into Crates\u2019s society, but upon condition that she\nshould, in all things, follow the practice and customs of his rule.\nThese philosophers set a great price upon virtue, and renounce all other\ndiscipline but the moral; and yet, in all their actions, they attributed\nthe sovereign authority to the election of their sage, and above the\nlaws; and gave no other curb to voluptuousness but moderation only, and\nthe conservation of the liberty of others.\n\nHeraclitus and Protagoras, forasmuch as wine seemed bitter to the sick,\nand pleasant to the sound, the rudder crooked in the water, and straight\nwhen out, and such like contrary appearances as are found in subjects,\nargued thence that all subjects had, in themselves, the causes of these\nappearances; and there was some bitterness in the wine which had some\nsympathy with the sick man\u2019s taste, and the rudder some bending quality\nsympathizing with him that looks upon it in the water; and so of all\nthe rest; which is to say, that all is in all things, and, consequently,\nnothing in any one; for, where all is, there is nothing.\n\nThis opinion put me in mind of the experience we have that there is\nno sense or aspect of any thing, whether bitter or sweet, straight\nor crooked, that the human mind does not find out in the writings it\nundertakes to tumble over. Into the cleanest, purest, and most perfect\nwords that can possibly be, how many lies and falsities have we\nsuggested! What heresy has not there found ground and testimony\nsufficient to make itself embraced and defended! \u2018Tis for this that the\nauthors of such errors will never depart from proof of the testimony of\nthe interpretation of words. A person of dignity, who would approve to\nme, by authority, the search of the philosopher\u2019s stone, wherein he\nwas head over ears engaged, lately alleged to me at least five or six\npassages of the Bible upon which, he said, he first founded his attempt,\nfor the discharge of his conscience (for he is a divine); and, in truth,\nthe idea was not only pleasant, but, moreover, very well accommodated to\nthe defence of this fine science.\n\nBy this way the reputation of divining fables is acquired. There is no\nfortune-teller, if we have this authority, but, if a man will take the\npains to tumble and toss, and narrowly to peep into all the folds and\nglosses of his words, he may make him, like the Sibyls, say what he\nwill. There are so many ways of interpretation that it will be hard but\nthat, either obliquely or in a direct line, an ingenious wit will\nfind out, in every subject, some air that will serve for his purpose;\ntherefore we find a cloudy and ambiguous style in so frequent and\nancient use. Let the author but make himself master of that, to busy\nposterity about his predictions, which not only his own parts, but the\naccidental favour of the matter itself, may do for him; and, as to\nthe rest, express himself, whether after a foolish or a subtle manner,\nsomewhat obscurely or contradictorily, \u2018tis no matter;--a number of\nwits, shaking and sifting him, will bring out a great many several\nforms, either according to his meaning, or collateral, or contrary, to\nit, which will all redound to his honour; he will see himself enriched\nby the means of his disciples, like the regents of colleges by their\npupils yearly presents. This it is which has given reputation to many\nthings of no worth at all; that has brought several writings in vogue,\nand given them the fame of containing all sorts of matter can be\ndesired; one and the same thing receiving a thousand and a thousand\nimages and various considerations; nay, as many as we please.\n\nIs it possible that Homer could design to say all that we make him\nsay, and that he designed so many and so various figures, as that the\ndivines, law-givers, captains, philosophers, and all sorts of men\nwho treat of sciences, how variously and opposite soever, should\nindifferently quote him, and support their arguments by his authority,\nas the sovereign lord and master of all offices, works, and artisans,\nand counsellor-general of all enterprises? Whoever has had occasion for\noracles and predictions has there found sufficient to serve his turn.\n\u2018Tis a wonder how many and how admirable concurrences an intelligent\nperson, and a particular friend of mine, has there found out in favour\nof our religion; and cannot easily be put out of the conceit that it was\nHomer\u2019s design; and yet he is as well acquainted with this author as\nany man whatever of his time. And what he has found in favour of our\nreligion there, very many anciently have found in favour of theirs. Do\nbut observe how Plato is tumbled and tossed about; every one ennobling\nhis own opinions by applying him to himself, and making him take what\nside they please. They draw him in, and engage him in all the new\nopinions the world receives; and make him, according to the different\ncourse of things, differ from himself; every one makes him disavow,\naccording to his own sense, the manners and customs lawful in his age,\nbecause they are unlawful in ours; and all this with vivacity and power,\naccording to the force and sprightliness of the wit of the interpreter.\nFrom the same foundation that Heraclitus and this sentence of his had,\n\u201cthat all things had in them those forms that we discern,\u201d Democritus\ndrew quite a contrary conclusion,--\u201cthat objects have in them nothing\nthat we discern in them;\u201d and because honey is sweet to one and bitter\nto another, he thence argued that it was neither sweet nor bitter. The\nPyrrhonians would say that they knew not whether it is sweet or bitter,\nor whether the one or the other, or both; for these always gained\nthe highest point of dubitation. The Cyrenaics held that nothing was\nperceptible from without, and that that only was perceptible that\ninwardly touched us, as pain and pleasure; acknowledging neither sound\nnor colour, but certain affections only that we receive from them; and\nthat man\u2019s judgment had no other seat Protagoras believed that \u201cwhat\nseems true to every one, is true to every one.\u201d The Epicureans lodged\nall judgment in the senses, and in the knowledge of things, and in\npleasure. Plato would have the judgment of truth, and truth itself,\nderived from opinions and the senses, to belong to the wit and\ncogitation.\n\nThis discourse has put me upon the consideration of the senses, in which\nlies the greatest foundation and Pro\u00b0f of our ignorance. Whatsoever is\nknown, is doubtless known by the faculty of the knower; for, seeing the\njudgment proceeds from the operation of him that judges, \u2018tis reason\nthat this operation be performed by his means and will, not by the\nconstraint of another; as it would happen if we knew things by the\npower, and according to the law of their essence. Now all knowledge is\nconveyed to us by the senses; they are our masters:--\n\n\n      Via qua munita fidei\n   Proxima fert humanum in pectus, templaque mentis;\n\n      \u201cIt is the surest path that faith can find\n   By which to enter human heart and mind.\u201d\n\n\nScience begins by them, and is resolved into them. After all, we should\nknow no more than a stone if we did not know there is sound, odour,\nlight, taste, measure, weight, softness, hardness, sharpness, colour,\nsmoothness, breadth, and depth; these are the platforms and principles\nof the structure of all our knowledge; and, according to some, science\nis nothing else but sense. He that could make me contradict the senses,\nwould have me by the throat; he could not make me go further back. The\nsenses are the beginning and the end of human knowledge:--\n\n\n      Invenies primis ab sensibns esse creatam\n   Notitiam veil; neque sensus posse refelli....\n   Quid majore fide porro, quam sensus, haberi Debet?\n\n      \u201cOf truth, whate\u2019er discoveries are made,\n   Are by the senses to us first conveyed;\n   Nor will one sense be baffled; for on what\n   Can we rely more safely than on that?\u201d\n\n\nLet us attribute to them the least we can, we must, however, of\nnecessity grant them this, that it is by their means and mediation that\nall our instruction is directed. Cicero says, that Chrysippus having\nattempted to extenuate the force and virtue of the senses, presented to\nhimself arguments and so vehement oppositions to the contrary that he\ncould not satisfy himself therein; whereupon Cameades, who maintained\nthe contrary side, boasted that he would make use of the very words and\narguments of Chrysippus to controvert and confute him, and therefore\nthus cried out against him: \u201cO miserable! thy force has destroyed thee.\u201d\n There can be nothing absurd to a greater degree than to maintain that\nfire does not warm, that light does not shine, and that there is no\nweight nor solidity in iron, which are things conveyed to us by the\nsenses; neither is there belief nor knowledge in man that can be\ncompared to that for certainty.\n\nThe first consideration I have upon the subject of the senses is that I\nmake a doubt whether or no man be furnished with all natural senses. I\nsee several animals who live an entire and perfect life, some without\nsight, others without hearing; who knows whether to us also one, two,\nthree, or many other senses may not be wanting? For if any one be\nwanting, our examination cannot discover the defect. \u2018Tis the privilege\nof the senses to be the utmost limit of our discovery; there is nothing\nbeyond them that can assist us in exploration, not so much as one sense\nin the discovery of another:--\n\n\n      An poterunt oculos aures reprehendere? an aures\n   Tactus an hunc porro tactum sapor argnet oris?\n   An confutabunt nares, oculive revincent?\n\n      \u201cCan ears the eyes, the touch the ears, correct?\n   Or is that touch by tasting to be check\u2019d?\n   Or th\u2019 other senses, shall the nose or eyes\n   Confute in their peculiar faculties?\u201d\n\n\nThey all make the extremest limits of our ability:--\n\n\n      Seorsum cuique potestas Divisa est, sua vis cuique est,\n\n      \u201cEach has its power distinctly and alone,\n   And every sense\u2019s power is its own.\u201d\n\n\nIt is impossible to make a man naturally blind conceive that he does not\nsee; impossible to make him desire sight, or to regret his defect; for\nwhich reason we ought not to derive any assurance from the soul\u2019s being\ncontented and satisfied with those we have; considering that it cannot\nbe sensible herein of its infirmity and imperfection, if there be any\nsuch thing. It is impossible to say any thing to this blind man, either\nby reasoning, argument, or similitude, that can possess his imagination\nwith any apprehension of light, colour, or sight; there\u2019s nothing\nremains behind that can push on the senses to evidence. Those that\nare born blind, whom we hear wish they could see, it is not that they\nunderstand what they desire; they have learned from us that they want\nsomething; that there is something to be desired that we have, which\nthey can name indeed and speak of its effect and consequences; but yet\nthey know not what it is, nor apprehend it at all.\n\nI have seen a gentleman of a good family who was born blind, or at least\nblind from such an age that he knows not what sight is; who is so little\nsensible of his defect that he makes use as we do of words proper for\nseeing, and applies them after a manner wholly particular and his own.\nThey brought him a child to which he was god-father, which, having taken\ninto his arms, \u201cGood God,\u201d said he, \u201cwhat a fine child! How beautiful\nto look upon! what a pretty face it has!\u201d He will say, like one of us,\n\u201cThis room has a very fine prospect;--it is clear weather;--the sun\nshines bright.\u201d And moreover, being that hunting, tennis, and butts are\nour exercises, and he has heard so, he has taken a liking to them, will\nride a-hunting, and believes he has as good share of the sport as we\nhave; and will express himself as angry or pleased as the best of us\nall, and yet knows nothing of it but by the ear. One cries out to him,\n\u201cHere\u2019s a hare!\u201d when he is upon some even plain where he may safely\nride; and afterwards, when they tell him, \u201cThe hare is killed,\u201d he will\nbe as overjoyed and proud of it as he hears others say they are. He will\ntake a tennis-ball in his left hand and strike it away with the racket;\nhe will shoot with a harquebuss at random, and is contented with what\nhis people tell him, that he is over, or wide.\n\nWho knows whether all human kind commit not the like absurdity, for want\nof some sense, and that through this default the greatest part of\nthe face of things is concealed from us? What do we know but that the\ndifficulties which we find in several works of nature proceed hence;\nand that several effects of animals, which exceed our capacity, are not\nproduced by faculty of some sense that we are defective in? and whether\nsome of them have not by this means a life more full and entire than\nours? We seize an apple with all our senses; we there find redness,\nsmoothness, odour, and sweetness; but it may have other virtues besides\nthese, as to heat or binding, which no sense of ours can have any\nreference unto. Is it not likely that there are sensitive faculties in\nnature that are fit to judge of and to discern those which we call the\noccult properties in several things, as for the loadstone to attract\niron; and that the want of such faculties is the cause that we\nare ignorant of the true essence of such things? \u2018Tis perhaps some\nparticular sense that gives cocks to understand what hour it is at\nmidnight, and when it grows to be towards day, and that makes them crow\naccordingly; that teaches chickens, before they have any experience of\nthe matter, to fear a sparrow-hawk, and not a goose or a peacock, though\nbirds of a much larger size; that cautions them against the hostile\nquality the cat has against them, and makes them not to fear a dog; to\narm themselves against the mewing, a kind of flattering voice, of the\none, and not against the barking, a shrill and threatening voice, of the\nother; that teaches wasps, ants, and rats, to fall upon the best pear\nand the best cheese before they have tasted them, and inspires the stag,\nelephant, and serpent, with the knowledge of a certain herb proper for\ntheir cure. There is no sense that has not a mighty dominion, and that\ndoes not by its power introduce an infinite number of knowledges. If\nwe were defective in the intelligence of sounds, of harmony, and of the\nvoice, it would cause an unimaginable confusion in all the rest of our\nscience; for, besides what belongs to the proper effect of every sense,\nhow many arguments, consequences, and conclusions do we draw to other\nthings, by comparing one sense with another? Let an understanding man\nimagine human nature originally produced without the sense of seeing,\nand consider what ignorance and trouble such a defect would bring upon\nhim, what a darkness and blindness in the soul; he will then see by that\nof how great importance to the knowledge of truth the privation of such\nanother sense, or of two or three, should we be so deprived, would be.\nWe have formed a truth by the consultation and concurrence of our five\nsenses; but perhaps we should have the consent and contribution of eight\nor ten to make a certain discovery of it in its essence.\n\nThe sects that controvert the knowledge of man do it principally by the\nuncertainty and weakness of our senses; for since all knowledge is\nby their means and mediation conveyed unto us, if they fail in their\nreport, if they corrupt or alter what they bring us from without, if the\nlight which by them creeps into the soul be obscured in the passage,\nwe have nothing else to hold by. From this extreme difficulty all these\nfancies proceed: \u201cThat every subject has in itself all we there find.\nThat it has nothing in it of what we think we there find;\u201d and that of\nthe Epicureans, \u201cThat the sun is no bigger than \u2018tis judged by our sight\nto be:--\u201d\n\n\n      Quidquid id est, nihilo fertur majore figura,\n   Quam nostris oculis quam cemimus, esse videtur:\n\n      \u201cBut be it what it will in our esteems,\n   It is no bigger than to us it seems:\u201d\n\n\nthat the appearances which represent a body great to him that is near,\nand less to him that is more remote, are both true:--\n\n\n      Nee tamen hic oculos falli concedimus hilum....\n   Proinde animi vitium hoc oculis adfingere noli:\n\n      \u201cYet that the eye\u2019s deluded we deny;\n   Charge not the mind\u2019s faults, therefore, on the eye:\u201d\n\n\n\u201cand, resolutely, that there is no deceit in the senses; that we are to\nlie at their mercy, and seek elsewhere reasons to excuse the difference\nand contradictions we there find, even to the inventing of lies and\nother flams, if it come to that, rather than accuse the senses.\u201d\n Timagoras vowed that, by pressing or turning his eye, he could never\nperceive the light of the candle to double, and that the seeming so\nproceeded from the vice of opinion, and not from the instrument. The\nmost absurd of all absurdities, with the Epicureans, is to deny the\nforce and effect of the senses:--\n\n\n      Proinde, quod in quoquo est his visum tempore, verum est\n   Et, si non potuit ratio dissolvere causam,\n   Cur ea, qu\u00e6 fuerint juxtim quadrata, procul sint\n   Visa rotunda; tamen pr\u00e6stat rationis egentem\n   Beddere mendose causas utriusque figur\u00e6,\n   Quam manibus manifesta suis emittere qu\u00e6quam,\n   Et violare fidem primam, et convellere tota\n   Fundamenta, quibus nixatur vita salusque:\n   Non modo enim ratio ruat omnis, vita quoque ipsa\n   Concidat extemplo, nisi credere sensibus ausis,\n   Procipitesque locos vitare, et c\u00e6tera, qu\u00e6 sint\n   In genere hoc fugienda.\n\n      \u201cThat what we see exists I will maintain,\n   And if our feeble reason can\u2019t explain\n   Why things seem square when they are very near,\n   And at a greater distance round appear;\n   \u2018Tis better yet, for him that\u2019s at a pause,\n   \u2018T\u2019 assign to either figure a false cause,\n   Than shock his faith, and the foundations rend\n   On which our safety and our life depend:\n   For reason not alone, but life and all,\n   Together will with sudden ruin fall;\n   Unless we trust our senses, nor despise\n   To shun the various dangers that arise.\u201d\n\n\nThis so desperate and unphilosophical advice expresses only this,--that\nhuman knowledge cannot support itself but by reason unreasonable,\nfoolish, and mad; but that it is yet better that man, to set a greater\nvalue upon himself, make use of any other remedy, how fantastic soever,\nthan to confess his necessary ignorance--a truth so disadvantageous to\nhim. He cannot avoid owning that the senses are the sovereign lords\nof his knowledge; but they are uncertain, and falsifiable in all\ncircumstances; \u2018tis there that he is to fight it out to the last; and\nif his just forces fail him, as they do, to supply that defect with\nobstinacy, temerity, and impudence. In case what the Epicureans say\nbe true, viz: \u201cthat we have no knowledge if the senses\u2019 appearances\nbe false;\u201d and if that also be true which the Stoics say, \u201cthat the\nappearances of the senses are so false that they can furnish us with no\nmanner of knowledge,\u201d we shall conclude, to the disadvantage of these\ntwo great dogmatical sects, that there is no science at all.\n\nAs to the error and uncertainty of the operation of the senses, every\none may furnish himself with as many examples as he pleases; so ordinary\nare the faults and tricks they put upon us. In the echo of a valley the\nsound of a trumpet seems to meet us, which comes from a place behind:--\n\n\n      Exstantesque procul medio de gurgite montes,\n   Classibus inter qnos liber patet exitus, idem\n   Apparent, et longe divolsi licet, ingens\n   Insula conjunctis tamen ex his ana videtur...\n   Et fugere ad puppim colies campique videntur,\n   Qnos agimns proter navim, velisque volamus....\n   Ubi in medio nobis equus acer obh\u00e6sit\n   Flamine, equi corpus transversum ferre videtur\n   Vis, et in adversum flumen contrudere raptim.\n\n      \u201cAnd rocks i\u2019 th\u2019 seas that proudly raise their head,\n   Though far disjoined, though royal navies spread,\n   Their sails between; yet if from distance shown,\n   They seem an island all combin\u2019d in one.\n   Thus ships, though driven by a prosperous gale,\n   Seem fix\u2019d to sailors; those seem under sail\n   That ride at anchor safe; and all admire,\n   As they row by, to see the rocks retire.\n   Thus, when in rapid streams my horse hath stood,\n   And I look\u2019d downward on the rolling flood;\n   Though he stood still, I thought he did divide\n   The headlong streams, and strive against the tide,\n   And all things seem\u2019d to move on every side.\u201d\n\n\nTake a musket-ball under the forefinger, the middle finger being lapped\nover it, it feels so like two that a man will have much ado to persuade\nhimself there is but one; the end of the two fingers feeling each of\nthem one at the same time; for that the senses are very often masters of\nour reason, and constrain it to receive impressions which it judges and\nknows to be false, is frequently seen. I set aside the sense of feeling,\nthat has its functions nearer, more lively, and substantial, that so\noften, by the effects of the pains it helps the body to, subverts and\noverthrows all those fine Stoical resolutions, and compels him to cry\nout of his belly, who has resolutely established this doctrine in his\nsoul--\u201cThat the colic, and all other pains and diseases, are indifferent\nthings, not having the power to abate any thing of the sovereign\nfelicity wherein the wise man is seated by his virtue.\u201d There is no\nheart so effeminate that the rattle and sound of our drums and trumpets\nwill not inflame with courage; nor so sullen that the harmony of our\nmusic will not rouse and cheer; nor so stubborn a soul that will\nnot feel itself struck with some reverence in considering the gloomy\nvastness of our churches, the variety of ornaments, and order of our\nceremonies; and in hearing the solemn music of our organs, and the grace\nand devout harmony of our voices. Even those that come in with contempt\nfeel a certain shivering in their hearts, and something of dread that\nmakes them begin to doubt their opinions. For my part I do not think\nmyself strong enough to hear an ode of Horace or Catullus sung by a\nbeautiful young mouth without emotion; and Zeno had reason to say \u201cthat\nthe voice was the flower of beauty.\u201d One would once make me believe that\na certain person, whom all we Frenchmen know, had imposed upon me in\nrepeating some verses that he had made; that they were not the same upon\npaper that they were in the air; and that my eyes would make a contrary\njudgment to my ears; so great a power has pronunciation to give fashion\nand value to works that are left to the efficacy and modulation of the\nvoice. And therefore Philoxenus was not so much to blame, hearing\none giving an ill accent to some composition of his, in spurning and\nbreaking certain earthen vessels of his, saying, \u201cI break what is thine,\nbecause thou corruptest what is mine.\u201d To what end did those men who\nhave, with a firm resolution, destroyed themselves, turn away their\nfaces that they might not see the blow that was by themselves appointed?\nAnd that those who, for their health, desire and command incisions to\nbe made, and cauteries to be applied to them, cannot endure the sight of\nthe preparations, instruments, and operations of the surgeon, being that\nthe sight is not in any way to participate in the pain? Are not these\nproper examples to verify the authority the senses have over the\nimagination? \u2018Tis to much purpose that we know these tresses were\nborrowed from a page or a lackey; that this rouge came from Spain, and\nthis pearl-powder from the Ocean Sea. Our sight will, nevertheless,\ncompel us to confess their subject more agreeable and more lovely\nagainst all reason; for in this there is nothing of its own:--\n\n\n      Auferinrar cultu; gemmis, auroque teguntur\n   Crimina; pars minima est ipsa puella sni.\n   S\u00e6pe, ubi sit quod ames, inter tarn multa requiras:\n   Decipit hac oculos \u00e6gide dives Amor.\n\n      \u201cBy dress we\u2019re won; gold, gems, and rich brocades\n   Make up the pageant that your heart invades;\n   In all that glittering figure which you see,\n   The far least part of her own self is she;\n   In vain for her you love amidst such cost\n   You search, the mistress in such dress is lost.\u201d\n\n\nWhat a strange power do the poets attribute to the senses, that make\nNarcissus so desperately in love with his own shadow,\n\n\n      Cunctaque miratur, quibus est mirabilis ipse;\n   Se cupit imprudens, et, qui probat, ipse probatur;\n   Dumque petit, petitur; pariterque accendit, et ardet:\n\n      \u201cAdmireth all; for which to be admired;\n   And inconsiderately himself desir\u2019d.\n   The praises which he gives his beauty claim\u2019d,\n   Who seeks is sought, th\u2019 inflamer is inflam\u2019d:\u201d\n\n\nand Pygmalion\u2019s judgment so troubled by the impression of the sight\nof his ivory statue that he loves and adores it as if it were a living\nwoman!\n\n\n      Oscnla dat, reddique putat: sequi turque, tenetque,\n   Et credit tactis digitos insidere membris;\n   Et metuit, pressos veniat ne livor in artus.\n\n      \u201cHe kisses, and believes he\u2019s kissed again;\n   Seizes, and \u2018twixt his arms his love doth strain,\n   And thinks the polish\u2019d ivory thus held\n   Doth to his fingers amorous pressure yield,\n   And has a timorous fear, lest black and blue\n   Should in the parts with ardour press\u2019d ensue.\u201d\n\n\nPut a philosopher into a cage of small thin set bars of iron, hang him\non the top of the high tower of Notre Dame at Paris; he will see, by\nmanifest reason, that he cannot possibly fall, and yet he will find\n(unless he has been used to the plumber\u2019s trade) that he cannot help but\nthe sight of the excessive height will fright and astound him; for we\nhave enough to do to assure ourselves in the galleries of our steeples,\nif they are made with open work, although they are of stone; and some\nthere are that cannot endure so much as to think of it. Let there be a\nbeam thrown over betwixt these two towers, of breadth sufficient to\nwalk upon, there is no philosophical wisdom so firm that can give us the\ncourage to walk over it as we should do upon the ground. I have often\ntried this upon our mountains in these parts; and though I am one who am\nnot the most subject to be afraid, I was not able to endure to look into\nthat infinite depth without horror and trembling, though I stood above\nmy length from the edge of the precipice, and could not have fallen\nunless I would. Where I also observed that, what height soever the\nprecipice was, provided there were some tree, or some jutting out of a\nrock, a little to support and divide the sight, it a little eases our\nfears, and gives greater assurance; as if they were things by which in\nfalling we might have some relief; but that direct precipices we are\nnot to look upon without being giddy; _Ut despici vine vertigine\ntimid ocvlorum animique non possit:_ \u201c\u2018To that one cannot look without\ndizziness;\u201d which is a manifest imposture of the sight. And therefore\nit was that that fine philosopher put out his own eyes, to free the soul\nfrom being diverted by them, and that he might philosophize at greater\nliberty; but, by the same rule, he should have dammed up his ears,\nthat Theophrastus says are the most dangerous instruments about us for\nreceiving violent impressions to alter and disturb us; and, finally,\nshould have deprived himself of all his other senses, that is to say, of\nhis life and being; for they have all the power to command our soul and\nreason: _Fit etiam sope specie qu\u00e2dam, sope vocum gravitate et cantibus,\nut pettantur animi vehementius; sope etiam cura et timor\u00e9,_ \u201cFor it\noften falls out that the minds are more vehemently struck by some sight,\nby the quality and sound of the voice, or by singing; and ofttimes also\nby grief and fear.\u201d Physicians hold that there are certain complexions\nthat are agitated by the same sounds and instruments even to fury. I\nhave seen some who could not hear a bone gnawed under the table without\nimpatience; and there is scarce any man who is not disturbed at the\nsharp and shrill noise that the file makes in grating upon the iron;\nas also to hear chewing near them, or to hear any one speak who has an\nimpediment in the throat or nose, will move some people even to anger\nand hatred. Of what use was that piping prompter of Gracchus, who\nsoftened, raised, and moved his master\u2019s voice whilst he declaimed at\nRome, if the movements and quality of the sound had not the power to\nmove and alter the judgments of the auditory? In earnest, there is\nwonderful reason to keep such a clutter about the firmness of this fine\npiece, that suffers itself to be turned and twined by the motion and\naccidents of so light a wind.\n\nThe same cheat that the senses put upon our understanding they have in\nturn put upon them; the soul also some times has its revenge; they lie\nand contend which should most deceive one another. What we see and hear\nwhen we are transported with passion, we neither see nor hear as it\nis:--\n\n\n   Et solem geminum, et duplices se ostendere Thebas.\n\n   \u201cThebes seems two cities, and the sun two suns.\u201d\n\n\nThe object that we love appears to us more beautiful than it really is;\n\n\n      Multimodis igitur pravas turpesque videmus\n   Esse in deliciis, summoque in honore vigere;\n\n      \u201cHence \u2018tis that ugly things in fancied dress\n   Seem gay, look fair to lovers\u2019 eyes, and please;\u201d\n\n\nand that we hate more ugly; to a discontented and afflicted man the\nlight of the day seems dark and overcast. Our senses are not only\ndepraved, but very often stupefied by the passions of the soul; how many\nthings do we see that we do not take notice of, if the mind be occupied\nwith other thoughts?\n\n\n      In rebus quoque apertis noscere possis,\n   Si non advertas animum, proinde esse quasi omni\n   Tempore semot\u00e6 fuerint, longeque remot\u00e6:\n\n      \u201cNay, even in plainest things, unless the mind\n   Take heed, unless she sets herself to find,\n   The thing no more is seen, no more belov\u2019d,\n   Than if the most obscure and most remov\u2019d:\u201d\n\n\nit would appear that the soul retires within, and amuses the powers of\nthe senses. And so both the inside and the outside of man is full of\ninfirmity and falsehood.\n\nThey who have compared our lives to a dream were, perhaps, more in the\nright than they were aware of. When we dream, the soul lives, works, and\nexercises all its faculties, neither more nor less than when awake;\nbut more largely and obscurely, yet not so much, neither, that the\ndifference should be as great as betwixt night and the meridian\nbrightness of the sun, but as betwixt night and shade; there she sleeps,\nhere she slumbers; but, whether more or less, \u2018tis still dark, and\nCimmerian darkness. We wake sleeping, and sleep waking. I do not see so\nclearly in my sleep; but as to my being awake, I never found it clear\nenough and free from clouds; moreover, sleep, when it is profound,\nsometimes rocks even dreams themselves asleep; but our waking is never\nso sprightly that it rightly purges and dissipates those whimsies, which\nare waking dreams, and worse than dreams. Our reason and soul receiving\nthose fancies and opinions that come in dreams, and authorizing the\nactions of our dreams with the like approbation that they do those of\nthe day, wherefore do we not doubt whether our thought, our action, is\nnot another sort of dreaming, and our waking a certain kind of sleep?\n\nIf the senses be our first judges, it is not ours that we are alone to\nconsult; for, in this faculty, beasts have as great, or greater, than\nwe; it is certain that some of them have the sense of hearing more quick\nthan man; others that of seeing, others that of feeling, others that\nof touch and taste. Democritus said, that the gods and brutes had the\nsensitive faculties more perfect than man. But betwixt the effects of\ntheir senses and ours the difference is extreme. Our spittle cleanses\nand dries up our wounds; it kills the serpent:--\n\n\n      Tantaque in his rebas distantia differitasque est,\n   Ut quod aliis cibus est, aliis fuat acre venenum.\n   S\u00e6pe etenim serpens, hominis contacta saliv\u00e0,\n   Disperit, ac sese mandendo conficit ipsa:\n\n      \u201cAnd in those things the difference is so great\n   That what\u2019s one\u2019s poison is another\u2019s meat;\n   For serpents often have been seen, \u2018tis said,\n   When touch\u2019d with human spittle, to go mad,\n   And bite themselves to death:\u201d\n\n\nwhat quality shall we attribute to our spittle? as it affects ourselves,\nor as it affects the serpent? By which of the two senses shall we prove\nthe true essence that we seek for?\n\nPliny says there are certain sea-hares in the Indies that are poison to\nus, and we to them; insomuch that, with the least touch, we kill\nthem. Which shall be truly poison, the man or the fish? Which shall we\nbelieve, the fish of the man, or the man of the fish? One quality of the\nair infects a man, that does the ox no harm; some other infects the ox,\nbut hurts not the man. Which of the two shall, in truth and nature, be\nthe pestilent quality? To them who have the jaundice, all things seem\nyellow and paler than to us:--\n\n\n      Lurida pr\u00e6terea fiunt, qu\u00e6cunque tuentur Arquati.\n\n      \u201cBesides, whatever jaundic\u2019d eyes do view\n   Looks pale as well as those, and yellow too.\u201d\n\n\nThey who are troubled with the disease that the physicians call\nhyposphagma--which is a suffusion of blood under the skin--see all\nthings red and bloody. What do we know but that these humours, which\nthus alter the operations of sight, predominate in beasts, and are usual\nwith them? for we see some whose eyes are yellow, like us who have the\njaundice; and others of a bloody colour; \u2018tis likely that the colours\nof objects seem other to them than to us. Which of the two shall make\na right judgment? for it is not said that the essence of things has a\nrelation to man only; hardness, whiteness, depth, and sharpness, have\nreference to the service and knowledge of animals as well as to us, and\nnature has equally designed them for their use. When we press down\nthe eye, the body that we look upon we perceive to be longer and more\nextended;--many beasts have their eyes so pressed down; this length,\ntherefore, is perhaps the true form of that body, and not that which our\neyes give it in the usual state. If we close the lower part of the eye\nthings appear double to us:--\n\n\n      Bina lucemarum fiorentia lumina flammis...\n   Et duplices hominum faci\u00e8s, et corpora bina.\n\n      \u201cOne lamp seems double, and the men appear\n   Each on two bodies double heads to bear.\u201d\n\n\nIf our ears be hindered, or the passage stopped with any thing, we\nreceive the sound quite otherwise than we usually do; animals, likewise,\nwho have either the ears hairy, or but a very little hole instead of an\near, do not, consequently, hear as we do, but receive another kind of\nsound. We see at festivals and theatres that, opposing a painted glass\nof a certain colour to the light of the flambeaux, all things in the\nplace appear to us green, yellow, or violet:--\n\n\n      Et vulgo faciunt id lutea russaque vela,\n   Et ferrugina, cum, magnis intenta theatris,\n   Per malos vulgata trabesque, trementia pendent;\n   Namque ibi consessum caveai subter, et omnem\n   Scenai speciem, patrum, matrumque, deorumque\n   Inficiunt, coguntque suo volitare colore:\n\n      \u201cThus when pale curtains, or the deeper red,\n   O\u2019er all the spacious theatre are spread,\n   Which mighty masts and sturdy pillars bear,\n   And the loose curtains wanton in the air;\n   Whole streams of colours from the summit flow,\n   The rays divide them in their passage through,\n   And stain the scenes, and men, and gods below:\u201d\n\n\n\u2018tis likely that the eyes of animals, which we see to be of divers\ncolours, produce the appearance of bodies the same with their eyes.\n\nWe should, therefore, to make a right judgment of the oppositions of\nthe senses, be first agreed with beasts, and secondly amongst ourselves;\nwhich we by no means are, but enter into dispute every time that one\nhears, sees, or tastes something otherwise than another does, and\ncontests, as much as upon any other thing, about the diversity of the\nimages that the senses represent to us. A child, by the ordinary rule of\nnature, hears, sees, and talks otherwise than a man of thirty years old;\nand he than one of threescore. The senses are, in some, more obscure and\ndusky, and more open and quick in others. We receive things variously,\naccording as we are, and according as they appear to us. Those rings\nwhich are cut out in the form of feathers, which are called _endless\nfeathers_, no eye can discern their size, or can keep itself from the\ndeception that on one side they enlarge, and on the other contract, and\ncome So a point, even when the ring is being turned round the finger;\nyet, when you feel them, they seem all of an equal size. Now, our\nperception being so uncertain and so controverted, it is no more a\nwonder if we are told that we may declare that snow appears white to us;\nbut that to affirm that it is in its own essence really so is more\nthan we are able to justify; and, this foundation being shaken, all\nthe knowledge in the world must of necessity fall to ruin. What! do\nour senses themselves hinder one another? A picture seems raised and\nembossed to the sight; in the handling it seems flat to the touch.\nShall we say that musk, which delights the smell, and is offensive to\nthe taste, is agreeable or no? There are herbs and unguents proper for\none part o\u00a3 the body, that are hurtful to another; honey is pleasant to\nthe taste, but offensive to the sight. They who, to assist their lust,\nused in ancient times to make use of magnifying-glasses to represent the\nmembers they were to employ bigger, by that ocular tumidity to please\nthemselves the more; to which of their senses did they give the\nprize,--whether to the sight, that represented the members as large and\ngreat as they would desire, or to the feeling, which represented them\nlittle and contemptible? Are they our senses that supply the subject\nwith these different conditions, and have the subjects themselves,\nnevertheless, but one? As we see in the bread we eat, it is nothing but\nbread, but, by being eaten, it becomes bones, blood, flesh, hair; and\nnails:--\n\n\n      Ut cibus in membra atque artus cum diditur omnes,\n   Disperit,, atque aliam naturam sufficit ex se;\n\n      \u201cAs meats, diffus\u2019d through all the members, lose\n   Their former state, and different things compose;\u201d\n\n\nthe humidity sucked up by the root of a tree becomes trunk, leaf, and\nfruit; and the air, being but one, is modulated, in a trumpet, to a\nthousand sorts of sounds; are they our senses, I would fain know, that,\nin like manner, form these subjects into so many divers qualities, or\nhave they them really such in themselves? And upon this doubt what can\nwe determine of their true essence? Moreover, since the accidents of\ndisease, of raving, or sleep, make things appear otherwise to us than\nthey do to the healthful, the wise, and those that are awake, is it\nnot likely that our right posture of health and understanding, and our\nnatural humours, have, also, wherewith to give a being to things\nthat have a relation to their own condition, and accommodate them to\nthemselves, as well as when they are disordered;--that health is as\ncapable of giving them an aspect as sickness? Why has not the temperate\na certain form of objects relative to it, as well as the intemperate?\nand why may it not as well stamp it with its own character as the other?\nHe whose mouth is out of taste, says the wine is flat; the healthful man\ncommends its flavour, and the thirsty its briskness. Now, our condition\nalways accommodating things to itself, and transforming them according\nto its own posture, we cannot know what things truly are in themselves,\nseeing that nothing comes to us but what is falsified and altered by the\nsenses. Where the compass, the square, and the rule, are crooked, all\npropositions drawn thence, and all buildings erected by those guides,\nmust, of necessity, be also defective; the uncertainty of our senses\nrenders every thing uncertain that they produce:--\n\n\n      Denique ut in fabric\u00e2, si prava est r\u00e9gula prima,\n   Normaque si fallax rectis regionibus exit,\n   Et libella aliqu\u00e2 si ex parte claudicat hilum;\n   Omnia mendose fieri, atque obstipa necessum est,\n   Prava, cubantia, prona, supina, atque absona tecta;\n   Jam ruere ut qu\u00e6dam videantux\u2019velle, ruantque\n   Prodita judiciis fallacibus omnia primis;\n   Sic igitur ratio tibi reram prava necesse est,\n   Falsaque sit, falsis qu\u00e6cunque ab sensibus orta est.\n\n      \u201cBut lastly, as in building, if the line\n   Be not exact and straight, the rule decline,\n   Or level false, how vain is the design!\n   Uneven, an ill-shap\u2019d and tottering wall\n   Must rise; this part must sink, that part must fall,\n   Because the rules were false that fashion\u2019d all;\n   Thus reason\u2019s rules are false if all commence\n   And rise from failing and from erring sense.\u201d\n\n\nAs to what remains, who can be fit to judge of and to determine those\ndifferences? As we say in controversies of religion that we must have\na judge neither inclining to the one side nor the other, free from all\nchoice and affection, which cannot be amongst Christians, just so it\nfalls out in this; for if he be old he cannot judge of the sense of\nold age, being himself a party in the case; if young, there is the same\nexception; if healthful, sick, asleep, or awake, he is still the\nsame incompetent judge. We must have some one exempt from all these\npropositions, as of things indifferent to him; and by this rule we must\nhave a judge that never was.\n\nTo judge of the appearances that we receive of subjects, we ought t\nhave a deciding instrument; to verify this instrument we must have\ndemonstration; to verify this demonstration an instrument; and here\nwe are round again upon the wheel, and no further advanced. Seeing\nthe senses cannot determine our dispute, being full of uncertainty\nthemselves, it must then be reason that must do it; but no reason can be\nerected upon any other foundation than that of another reason; and so we\nrun back to all infinity. Our fancy does not apply itself to things that\nare strange, but is conceived by the mediation of the senses; and the\nsenses do not comprehend a foreign subject, but only their own passions;\nby which means fancy and appearance are no part of the subject, but only\nof the passion and sufferance of sense; which passion and subject are\ndifferent things; wherefore whoever judges by appearances judges by\nanother thing than the subject. And to say that the passions of\nthe senses convey to the soul the quality of foreign subjects by\nresemblance, how can the soul and understanding be assured of this\nresemblance, having of itself no commerce with foreign subjects? As they\nwho never knew Socrates cannot, when they see his picture, say it is\nlike him. Now, whoever would, notwithstanding, judge by appearances, if\nit be by all, it is impossible, because they hinder one another by their\ncontrarieties and discrepancies, as we by experience see: shall some\nselect appearances govern the rest? you must verify this select by\nanother select, the second by a third, and thus there will never be\nany end to it. Finally, there is no constant existence, neither of the\nobjects\u2019 being nor our own; both we, and our judgments, and all mortal\nthings, are evermore incessantly running and rolling; and consequently\nnothing certain can be established from the one to the other, both the\njudging and the judged being in a continual motion and mutation.\n\nWe have no communication with being, by reason that all human nature is\nalways in the middle, betwixt being bom and dying, giving but an obscure\nappearance and shadow, a weak and uncertain opinion of itself; and if,\nperhaps, you fix your thought to apprehend your being, it would be but\nlike grasping water; for the more you clutch your hand to squeeze and\nhold what is in its own nature flowing, so much more you lose of what\nyou would grasp and hold. So, seeing that all things are subject to\npass from one change to another, reason, that there looks for a real\nsubstance, finds itself deceived, not being able to apprehend any thing\nthat is subsistent and permanent, because that every thing is either\nentering into being, and is not yet arrived at it, or begins to die\nbefore it is bom. Plato said, that bodies had never any existence, but\nonly birth; conceiving that Homer had made the Ocean and Thetis father\nand mother of the gods, to show us that all things are in a perpetual\nfluctuation, motion, and variation; the opinion of all the philosophers,\nas he says, before his time, Parmenides only excepted, who would not\nallow things to have motion, on the power whereof he sets a mighty\nvalue. Pythagoras was of opinion that all matter was flowing and\nunstable; the Stoics, that there is no time present, and that what we\ncall so is nothing but the juncture and meeting of the future and the\npast; Heraclitus, that never any man entered twice into the same river;\nEpichar-mus, that he who borrowed money but an hour ago does not owe\nit now; and that he who was invited over-night to come the next day to\ndinner comes nevertheless uninvited, considering that they are no more\nthe same men, but are become others; and that there could not a mortal\nsubstance be found twice in the same condition; for, by the suddenness\nand quickness of the change, it one while disperses, and another\nreunites; it comes and goes after such a manner that what begins to be\nborn never arrives to the perfection of being, forasmuch as that birth\nis never finished and never stays, as being at an end, but from the seed\nis evermore changing and shifting one to another; as human seed is first\nin the mother\u2019s womb made a formless embryo, after delivered thence a\nsucking infant, afterwards it becomes a boy, then a youth, then a man,\nand at last a decrepit old man; so that age and subsequent generation is\nalways destroying and spoiling that which went before:--\n\n\n      Mut\u00e2t enira mundi naturam totius \u00e6tas,\n   Ex alioque alius status excipere omnia debet;\n   Nec manet ulla sui similis res; omnia migrant,\n   Omnia commut\u00e2t natura, et vertere cogit.\n\n      \u201cFor time the nature of the world translates,\n   And from preceding gives all things new states;\n   Nought like itself remains, but all do range,\n   And nature forces every thing to change.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cAnd yet we foolishly fear one kind of death, whereas we have already\npassed, and do daily pass, so many others; for not only, as Heraclitus\nsaid, the death of fire is generation of air, and the death of air\ngeneration of water; but, moreover, we may more manifestly discern it in\nourselves; manhood dies, and passes away when age comes on; and youth is\nterminated in the flower of age of a full-grown man, infancy in youth,\nand the first age dies in infancy; yesterday died in to-day, and to-day\nwill die in to-morrow; and there is nothing that remains in the same\nstate, or that is always the same thing. And that it is so let this be\nthe proof; if we are always one and the same, how comes it to pass that\nwe are now pleased with one thing, and by and by with another? How\ncomes it to pass that we love or hate contrary things, that we praise\nor condemn them? How comes it to pass that we have different affections,\nand no more retain the same sentiment in the same thought? For it is not\nlikely that without mutation we should assume other passions; and, that\nwhich suffers mutation does not remain the same, and if it be not the\nsame it is not at all; but the same that the being is does, like it,\nunknowingly change and alter; becoming evermore another from another\nthing; and consequently the natural senses abuse and deceive themselves,\ntaking that which seems for that which is, for want of well knowing\nwhat that which is, is. But what is it then that truly is? That which is\neternal; that is to say, that never had beginning, nor never shall have\nending, and to which time can bring no mutation. For time is a mobile\nthine, and that appears as in a shadow, with a matter evermore flowing\nand running, without ever remaining stable and permanent; and to which\nbelong those words, _before and after, has been, or shall be:_ which at\nthe first sight, evidently show that it is not a thing that is; for it\nwere a great folly, and a manifest falsity, to say that that is which is\nnot \u00ffet being, or that has already ceased to be. And as to these words,\n_present, instant, and now_, by which it seems that we principally\nsupport and found the intelligence of time, reason, discovering, does\npresently destroy it; for it immediately divides and splits it into the\n_future and past_, being of necessity to consider it divided in two. The\nsame happens to nature, that is measured, as to time that measures it;\nfor she has nothing more subsisting and permanent than the other, but\nall things are either born, bearing, or dying. So that it were sinful to\nsay of God, who is he only who _is, that he was, or that he shall be _;\nfor those are terms of declension, transmutation, and vicissitude, of\nwhat cannot continue or remain in being; wherefore we are to conclude\nthat God alone is, not according to any measure of time, but according\nto an immutable and an immovable eternity, not measured by time, nor\nsubject to any declension; before whom nothing was, and after whom\nnothing shall be, either more new or more recent, but a real being, that\nwith one sole now fills the for ever, and that there is nothing that\ntruly is but he alone; without our being able to say, _he has been, or\nshall be_; without beginning, and without end.\u201d To this so religious\nconclusion of a pagan I shall only add this testimony of one of the same\ncondition, for the close of this long and tedious discourse, which would\nfurnish me with endless matter: \u201cWhat a vile and abject thing,\u201d says he,\n\u201cis man, if he do not raise himself above humanity!\u201d \u2018Tis a good word\nand a profitable desire, but withal absurd; for to make the handle\nbigger than the hand, the cubic longer than the arm, and to hope\nto stride further than our legs can reach, is both impossible and\nmonstrous; or that man should rise above himself and humanity; for he\ncannot see but with his eyes, nor seize but with his hold. He shall\nbe exalted, if God will lend him an extraordinary hand; he shall exalt\nhimself, by abandoning and renouncing his own proper means, and by\nsuffering himself to be raised and elevated by means purely celestial.\nIt belongs to our Christian faith, and not to the stoical virtue, to\npretend to that divine and miraculous metamorphosis.\n\n\n\n\n     ETEXT EDITOR\u2019S BOOKMARKS:\n\n     A little cheese when a mind to make a feast\n     A word ill taken obliterates ten years\u2019 merit\n     Cato said: So many servants, so many enemies\n     Cherish themselves most where they are most wrong\n     Condemn all violence in the education of a tender soul\n     Cruelty is the very extreme of all vices\n     Disguise, by their abridgments and at their own choice\n     Epicurus\n     Flatterer in your old age or in your sickness\n     He felt a pleasure and delight in so noble an action\n     He judged other men by himself\n     I cannot well refuse to play with my dog\n     I do not much lament the dead, and should envy them rather\n     I had rather be old a brief time, than be old before old age\n     I owe it rather to my fortune than my reason\n     Incline the history to their own fancy\n     It (my books) may know many things that are gone from me\n     Knowledge and truth may be in us without judgment\n     Learn the theory from those who best know the practice\n     Loved them for our sport, like monkeys, and not as men\n     Motive to some vicious occasion or some prospect of profit\n     My books: from me hold that which I have not retained\n     My dog unseasonably importunes me to play\n     My innocence is a simple one; little vigour and no art.\n     Never observed any great stability in my soul to resist passions\n     Nothing tempts my tears but tears\n     Omit, as incredible, such things as they do not understand\n     On all occasions to contradict and oppose\n     Only desire to become more wise, not more learned or eloquent\n     Passion of dandling and caressing infants scarcely born\n     Perfection: but I will not buy it so dear as it costs\n     Plato will have nobody marry before thirty\n     Prudent and just man may be intemperate and inconsistent\n     Puerile simplicities of our children\n     Shelter my own weakness under these great reputations\n     Socrates kept a confounded scolding wife\n     The authors, with whom I converse\n     There is no recompense becomes virtue\n     To do well where there was danger was the proper office\n     To whom no one is ill who can be good?\n     Turks have alms and hospitals for beasts\n     Vices will cling together, if a man have not a care\n     Virtue is much strengthened by combats\n     Virtue refuses facility for a companion\n\n\n\n\n\n\nESSAYS OF MICHEL DE MONTAIGNE\n\nTranslated by Charles Cotton\n\nEdited by William Carew Hazlitt\n\n1877\n\n\n\n\nCONTENTS OF VOLUME 11.\n\nXIII.

Few men come to die in the opinion that it is their\nlatest hour; and there is nothing wherein the flattery of hope more\ndeludes us; It never ceases to whisper in our ears, \u201cOthers have been\nmuch sicker without dying; your condition is not so desperate as \u2018tis\nthought; and, at the worst, God has done other miracles.\u201d  Which happens\nby reason that we set too much value upon ourselves; it seems as if the\nuniversality of things were in some measure to suffer by our dissolution,\nand that it commiserates our condition, forasmuch as our disturbed sight\nrepresents things to itself erroneously, and that we are of opinion they\nstand in as much need of us as we do of them, like people at sea, to whom\nmountains, fields, cities, heaven and earth are tossed at the same rate\nas they are:\n\n          \u201cProvehimur portu, terraeque urbesque recedunt:\u201d\n\n          [\u201cWe sail out of port, and cities and lands recede.\u201d\n           --AEneid, iii. 72.]\n\nWhoever saw old age that did not applaud the past and condemn the present\ntime, laying the fault of his misery and discontent upon the world and\nthe manners of men?\n\n          \u201cJamque caput quassans, grandis suspirat arator.\n          Et cum tempora temporibus praesentia confert\n          Praeteritis, laudat fortunas saepe parentis,\n          Et crepat antiquum genus ut pietate repletum.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cNow the old ploughman, shaking his head, sighs, and compares\n     present times with past, often praises his parents\u2019 happiness, and\n     talks of the old race as full of piety.\u201d--Lucretius, ii. 1165.]\n\nWe will make all things go along with us; whence it follows that we\nconsider our death as a very great thing, and that does not so easily\npass, nor without the solemn consultation of the stars:\n\n               \u201cTot circa unum caput tumultuantes dens,\u201d\n\n               [\u201cAll the gods to agitation about one man.\u201d\n                --Seneca, Suasor, i. 4.]\n\nand so much the more think it as we more value ourselves.  \u201cWhat, shall\nso much knowledge be lost, with so much damage to the world, without a\nparticular concern of the destinies?  Does so rare and exemplary a soul\ncost no more the killing than one that is common and of no use to the\npublic?  This life, that protects so many others, upon which so many\nother lives depend, that employs so vast a number of men in his service,\nthat fills so many places, shall it drop off like one that hangs but by\nits own simple thread?   None of us lays it enough to heart that he is\nbut one: thence proceeded those words of Caesar to his pilot, more tumid\nthan the sea that threatened him:\n\n              \u201cItaliam si coelo auctore recusas,\n               Me pete: sola tibi causa est haec justa timoris,\n               Vectorem non nosce tuum; perrumpe procellas,\n               Tutela secure mea.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cIf you decline to sail to Italy under the God\u2019s protection, trust\n     to mine; the only just cause you have to fear is, that you do not\n     know your passenger; sail on, secure in my guardianship.\u201d\n      --Lucan, V. 579.]\n\nAnd these:\n\n              \u201cCredit jam digna pericula Caesar\n               Fatis esse suis; tantusne evertere, dixit,\n               Me superis labor est, parva quern puppe sedentem,\n               Tam magno petiere mari;\u201d\n\n     [\u201cCaesar now deemed these dangers worthy of his destiny: \u2018What!\u2019\n     said he, \u2018is it for the gods so great a task to overthrow me, that\n     they must be fain to assail me with great seas in a poor little\n     bark.\u2019\u201d--Lucan, v. 653.]\n\nand that idle fancy of the public, that the sun bore on his face mourning\nfor his death a whole year:\n\n              \u201cIlle etiam extincto miseratus Caesare Romam,\n               Cum caput obscura nitidum ferrugine texit:\u201d\n\n     [\u201cCaesar being dead, the sun in mourning clouds, pitying Rome,\n     clothed himself.\u201d--Virgil, Georg., i. 466.]\n\nand a thousand of the like, wherewith the world suffers itself to be so\neasily imposed upon, believing that our interests affect the heavens, and\nthat their infinity is concerned at our ordinary actions:\n\n          \u201cNon tanta caelo societas nobiscum est, ut nostro\n          fato mortalis sit ille quoque siderum fulgor.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThere is no such alliance betwixt us and heaven, that the\n     brightness of the stars should be made also mortal by our death.\u201d\n      --Pliny, Nat.  Hist., ii. 8.]\n\nNow, to judge of constancy and resolution in a man who does not yet\nbelieve himself to be certainly in danger, though he really is, is not\nreason; and \u2018tis not enough that he die in this posture, unless he\npurposely put himself into it for this effect.  It commonly falls out in\nmost men that they set a good face upon the matter and speak with great\nindifference, to acquire reputation, which they hope afterwards, living,\nto enjoy.  Of all whom I have seen die, fortune has disposed their\ncountenances and no design of theirs; and even of those who in ancient\ntimes have made away with themselves, there is much to be considered\nwhether it were a sudden or a lingering death.  That cruel Roman Emperor\nwould say of his prisoners, that he would make them feel death, and if\nany one killed himself in prison, \u201cThat fellow has made an escape from\nme\u201d; he would prolong death and make it felt by torments:\n\n              \u201cVidimus et toto quamvis in corpore caeso\n               Nil anima lethale datum, moremque nefandae,\n               Durum saevitix, pereuntis parcere morti.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cWe have seen in tortured bodies, amongst the wounds, none that\n     have been mortal, inhuman mode of dire cruelty, that means to kill,\n     but will not let men die.\u201d--Lucan, iv. i. 78.]\n\nIn plain truth, it is no such great matter for a man in health and in a\ntemperate state of mind to resolve to kill himself; it is very easy to\nplay the villain before one comes to the point, insomuch that\nHeliogabalus, the most effeminate man in the world, amongst his lowest\nsensualities, could forecast to make himself die delicately, when he\nshould be forced thereto; and that his death might not give the lie to\nthe rest of his life, had purposely built a sumptuous tower, the front\nand base of which were covered with planks enriched with gold and\nprecious stones, thence to precipitate himself; and also caused cords\ntwisted with gold and crimson silk to be made, wherewith to strangle\nhimself; and a sword with the blade of gold to be hammered out to fall\nupon; and kept poison in vessels of emerald and topaz wherewith to poison\nhimself according as he should like to choose one of these ways of dying:\n\n          \u201cImpiger. . . ad letum et fortis virtute coacta.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cResolute and brave in the face of death by a forced courage.\n     --\u201cLucan, iv. 798.]\n\nYet in respect of this person, the effeminacy of his preparations makes\nit more likely that he would have thought better on\u2019t, had he been put to\nthe test.  But in those who with greater resolution have determined to\ndespatch themselves, we must examine whether it were with one blow which\ntook away the leisure of feeling the effect for it is to be questioned\nwhether, perceiving life, by little and little, to steal away the\nsentiment of the body mixing itself with that of the soul, and the means\nof repenting being offered, whether, I say, constancy and obstinacy in so\ndangerous an intention would have been found.\n\nIn the civil wars of Caesar, Lucius Domitius, being taken in the Abruzzi,\nand thereupon poisoning himself, afterwards repented.  It has happened in\nour time that a certain person, being resolved to die and not having gone\ndeep enough at the first thrust, the sensibility of the flesh opposing\nhis arm, gave himself two or three wounds more, but could never prevail\nupon himself to thrust home.  Whilst Plautius Silvanus was upon his\ntrial, Urgulania, his grandmother, sent him a poniard with which, not\nbeing able to kill himself, he made his servants cut his veins. Albucilla\nin Tiberius time having, to kill himself, struck with too much\ntenderness, gave his adversaries opportunity to imprison and put him to\ndeath their own way.\u2019 And that great leader, Demosthenes, after his rout\nin Sicily, did the same; and C. Fimbria, having struck himself too\nweakly, entreated his servant to despatch him.  On the contrary,\nOstorius, who could not make use of his own arm, disdained to employ that\nof his servant to any other use but only to hold the poniard straight and\nfirm; and bringing his throat to it, thrust himself through.  \u2018Tis, in\ntruth, a morsel that is to be swallowed without chewing, unless a man be\nthoroughly resolved; and yet Adrian the emperor made his physician mark\nand encircle on his pap the mortal place wherein he was to stab to whom\nhe had given orders to kill him.  For this reason it was that Caesar,\nbeing asked what death he thought to be the most desired, made answer,\n\u201cThe least premeditated and the shortest.\u201d--[Tacitus, Annals, xvi. 15]--\nIf Caesar dared to say it, it is no cowardice in me to believe it.\u201d\n A short death,\u201d says Pliny, \u201cis the sovereign good hap of human life.\n\u201cPeople do not much care to recognise it.  No one can say that he is\nresolute for death who fears to deal with it and cannot undergo it with\nhis eyes open: they whom we see in criminal punishments run to their\ndeath and hasten and press their execution, do it not out of resolution,\nbut because they will not give them selves leisure to consider it; it\ndoes not trouble them to be dead, but to die:\n\n          \u201cEmodi nolo, sed me esse mortem nihil astigmia:\u201d\n\n     [\u201cI have no mind to die, but I have no objection to be dead.\u201d\n      --Epicharmus, apud Cicero, Tusc.  Quaes., i. 8.]\n\n\u2018tis a degree of constancy to which I have experimented, that I can\narrive, like those who plunge into dangers, as into the sea, with their\neyes shut.\n\nThere is nothing, in my opinion, more illustrious in the life of\nSocrates, than that he had thirty whole days wherein to ruminate upon the\nsentence of his death, to have digested it all that time with a most\nassured hope, without care, and without alteration, and with a series of\nwords and actions rather careless and indifferent than any way stirred or\ndiscomposed by the weight of such a thought.\n\nThat Pomponius Atticus, to whom Cicero writes so often, being sick,\ncaused Agrippa, his son-in-law, and two or three more of his friends, to\nbe called to him, and told them, that having found all means practised\nupon him for his recovery to be in vain, and that all he did to prolong\nhis life also prolonged and augmented his pain, he was resolved to put an\nend both to the one and the other, desiring them to approve of his\ndetermination, or at least not to lose their labour in endeavouring to\ndissuade him.  Now, having chosen to destroy himself by abstinence, his\ndisease was thereby cured: the remedy that he had made use of to kill\nhimself restored him to health.  His physicians and friends, rejoicing at\nso happy an event, and coming to congratulate him, found themselves very\nmuch deceived, it being impossible for them to make him alter his\npurpose, he telling them, that as he must one day die, and was now so far\non his way, he would save himself the labour of beginning another time.\nThis man, having surveyed death at leisure, was not only not discouraged\nat its approach, but eagerly sought it; for being content that he had\nengaged in the combat, he made it a point of bravery to see the end; \u2018tis\nfar beyond not fearing death to taste and relish it.\n\nThe story of the philosopher Cleanthes is very like this: he had his gums\nswollen and rotten; his physicians advised him to great abstinence:\nhaving fasted two days, he was so much better that they pronounced him\ncured, and permitted him to return to his ordinary course of diet; he, on\nthe contrary, already tasting some sweetness in this faintness of his,\nwould not be persuaded to go back, but resolved to proceed, and to finish\nwhat he had so far advanced.\n\nTullius Marcellinus, a young man of Rome, having a mind to anticipate the\nhour of his destiny, to be rid of a disease that was more trouble to him\nthan he was willing to endure, though his physicians assured him of a\ncertain, though not sudden, cure, called a council of his friends to\ndeliberate about it; of whom some, says Seneca, gave him the counsel that\nout of unmanliness they would have taken themselves; others, out of\nflattery, such as they thought he would best like; but a Stoic said this\nto him: \u201cDo not concern thyself, Marcellinus, as if thou didst deliberate\nof a thing of importance; \u2018tis no great matter to live; thy servants and\nbeasts live; but it is a great thing to die handsomely, wisely, and\nfirmly.  Do but think how long thou hast done the same things, eat,\ndrink, and sleep, drink, sleep, and eat: we incessantly wheel in the same\ncircle.  Not only ill and insupportable accidents, but even the satiety\nof living, inclines a man to desire to die.\u201d  Marcellinus did not stand\nin need of a man to advise, but of a man to assist him; his servants were\nafraid to meddle in the business, but this philosopher gave them to under\nstand that domestics are suspected even when it is in doubt whether the\ndeath of the master were voluntary or no; otherwise, that it would be of\nas ill example to hinder him as to kill him, forasmuch as:\n\n               \u201cInvitum qui servat, idem facit occidenti.\u201d\n\n          [\u201cHe who makes a man live against his will, \u2018tis as cruel\n          as to kill him.\u201d--Horat., De Arte Poet., 467]\n\nHe then told Marcellinus that it would not be unbecoming, as what is left\non the tables when we have eaten is given to the attendants, so, life\nbeing ended, to distribute something to those who have been our servants.\nNow Marcellinus was of a free and liberal spirit; he, therefore, divided\na certain sum of money amongst his servants, and consoled them.  As to\nthe rest, he had no need of steel nor of blood: he resolved to go out of\nthis life and not to run out of it; not to escape from death, but to\nessay it.  And to give himself leisure to deal with it, having forsaken\nall manner of nourishment, the third day following, after having caused\nhimself to be sprinkled with warm water, he fainted by degrees, and not\nwithout some kind of pleasure, as he himself declared.\n\nIn fact, such as have been acquainted with these faintings, proceeding\nfrom weakness, say that they are therein sensible of no manner of pain,\nbut rather feel a kind of delight, as in the passage to sleep and best.\nThese are studied and digested deaths.\n\nBut to the end that Cato only may furnish out the whole example of\nvirtue, it seems as if his good with which the leisure to confront and\nstruggle with death, reinforcing his destiny had put his ill one into the\nhand he gave himself the blow, seeing he had courage in the danger,\ninstead of letting it go less.  And if I had had to represent him in his\nsupreme station, I should have done it in the posture of tearing out his\nbloody bowels, rather than with his sword in his hand, as did the\nstatuaries of his time, for this second murder was much more furious than\nthe first.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nTHAT OUR MIND HINDERS ITSELF\n\n\u2018Tis a pleasant imagination to fancy a mind exactly balanced betwixt two\nequal desires: for, doubtless, it can never pitch upon either, forasmuch\nas the choice and application would manifest an inequality of esteem;\nand were we set betwixt the bottle and the ham, with an equal appetite to\ndrink and eat, there would doubtless be no remedy, but we must die of\nthirst and hunger.  To provide against this inconvenience, the Stoics,\nwhen they are asked whence the election in the soul of two indifferent\nthings proceeds, and that makes us, out of a great number of crowns,\nrather take one than another, they being all alike, and there being no\nreason to incline us to such a preference, make answer, that this\nmovement of the soul is extraordinary and irregular, entering into us\nby a foreign, accidental, and fortuitous impulse.  It might rather,\nmethinks, he said, that nothing presents itself to us wherein there is\nnot some difference, how little soever; and that, either by the sight or\ntouch, there is always some choice that, though it be imperceptibly,\ntempts and attracts us; so, whoever shall presuppose a packthread equally\nstrong throughout, it is utterly impossible it should break; for, where\nwill you have the breaking to begin? and that it should break altogether\nis not in nature.  Whoever, also, should hereunto join the geometrical\npropositions that, by the certainty of their demonstrations, conclude the\ncontained to be greater than the containing, the centre to be as great as\nits circumference, and that find out two lines incessantly approaching\neach other, which yet can never meet, and the philosopher\u2019s stone, and\nthe quadrature of the circle, where the reason and the effect are so\nopposite, might, peradventure, find some argument to second this bold\nsaying of Pliny:\n\n                    \u201cSolum certum nihil esse certi,\n               et homine nihil miserius ant superbius.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cIt is only certain that there is nothing certain, and that nothing\n     is more miserable or more proud than man.\u201d--Nat. Hist., ii. 7.]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nTHAT OUR DESIRES ARE AUGMENTED BY DIFFICULTY\n\nThere is no reason that has not its contrary, say the wisest of the\nphilosophers.  I was just now ruminating on the excellent saying one of\nthe ancients alleges for the contempt of life: \u201cNo good can bring\npleasure, unless it be that for the loss of which we are beforehand\nprepared.\u201d\n\n          \u201cIn aequo est dolor amissae rei, et timor amittendae,\u201d\n\n          [\u201cThe grief of losing a thing, and the fear of losing it,\n          are equal.\u201d--Seneca, Ep., 98.]\n\nmeaning by this that the fruition of life cannot be truly pleasant to us\nif we are in fear of losing it.  It might, however, be said, on the\ncontrary, that we hug and embrace this good so much the more earnestly,\nand with so much greater affection, by how much we see it the less\nassured and fear to have it taken from us: for it is evident, as fire\nburns with greater fury when cold comes to mix with it, that our will is\nmore obstinate by being opposed:\n\n               \u201cSi nunquam Danaen habuisset ahenea turris,\n               Non esses, Danae, de Jove facta parens;\u201d\n\n     [\u201cIf a brazen tower had not held Danae, you would not, Danae, have\n     been made a mother by Jove.\u201d--Ovid, Amoy., ii. 19, 27.]\n\nand that there is nothing naturally so contrary to our taste as satiety\nwhich proceeds from facility; nor anything that so much whets it as\nrarity and difficulty:\n\n     \u201cOmnium rerum voluptas ipso, quo debet fugare, periculo crescit.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThe pleasure of all things increases by the same danger that\n     should deter it.\u201d--Seneca, De Benef., vii. 9.]\n\n          \u201cGalla, nega; satiatur amor, nisi gaudia torquent.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cGalla, refuse me; love is glutted with joys that are not attended\n     with trouble.\u201d--Martial, iv. 37.]\n\nTo keep love in breath, Lycurgus made a decree that the married people of\nLacedaemon should never enjoy one another but by stealth; and that it\nshould be as great a shame to take them in bed together as committing\nwith others.  The difficulty of assignations, the danger of surprise, the\nshame of the morning,\n\n                    \u201cEt languor, et silentium,\n                    Et latere petitus imo Spiritus:\u201d\n\n     [\u201cAnd languor, and silence, and sighs, coming from the innermost\n     heart.\u201d--Hor., Epod., xi. 9.]\n\nthese are what give the piquancy to the sauce.  How many very wantonly\npleasant sports spring from the most decent and modest language of the\nworks on love?  Pleasure itself seeks to be heightened with pain; it is\nmuch sweeter when it smarts and has the skin rippled.  The courtesan\nFlora said she never lay with Pompey but that she made him wear the\nprints of her teeth.--[Plutarch, Life of Pompey, c. i.]\n\n          \u201cQuod petiere, premunt arcte, faciuntque dolorem\n          Corporis, et dentes inlidunt saepe labellis .  .  .\n          Et stimuli subsunt, qui instigant laedere ad ipsum,\n          Quodcunque est, rabies unde illae germina surgunt.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cWhat they have sought they dress closely, and cause pain; on the\n     lips fix the teeth, and every kiss indents: urged by latent stimulus\n     the part to wound\u201d--Lucretius, i. 4.]\n\nAnd so it is in everything: difficulty gives all things their estimation;\nthe people of the march of Ancona more readily make their vows to St.\nJames, and those of Galicia to Our Lady of Loreto; they make wonderful\nto-do at Liege about the baths of Lucca, and in Tuscany about those of\nAspa: there are few Romans seen in the fencing school of Rome, which is\nfull of French.  That great Cato also, as much as us, nauseated his wife\nwhilst she was his, and longed for her when in the possession of another.\nI was fain to turn out into the paddock an old horse, as he was not to be\ngoverned when he smelt a mare: the facility presently sated him as\ntowards his own, but towards strange mares, and the first that passed by\nthe pale of his pasture, he would again fall to his importunate neighings\nand his furious heats as before.  Our appetite contemns and passes by\nwhat it has in possession, to run after that it has not:\n\n          \u201cTransvolat in medio posita, et fugientia captat.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cHe slights her who is close at hand, and runs after her\n     who flees from him.\u201d--Horace, Sat., i. 2, 108.]\n\nTo forbid us anything is to make us have a mind to\u2019t:\n\n                         \u201cNisi to servare puellam\n               Incipis, incipiet desinere esse mea:\u201d\n\n     [\u201cUnless you begin to guard your mistress, she will soon begin\n     to be no longer mine.\u201d--Ovid, Amoy., ii. 19, 47.]\n\nto give it wholly up to us is to beget in us contempt.  Want and\nabundance fall into the same inconvenience:\n\n               \u201cTibi quod superest, mihi quod desit, dolet.\u201d\n\n          [\u201cYour superfluities trouble you, and what I want\n          troubles me.--\u201cTerence, Phoym., i. 3, 9.]\n\nDesire and fruition equally afflict us.  The rigors of mistresses are\ntroublesome, but facility, to say truth, still more so; forasmuch as\ndiscontent and anger spring from the esteem we have of the thing desired,\nheat and actuate love, but satiety begets disgust; \u2018tis a blunt, dull,\nstupid, tired, and slothful passion:\n\n          \u201cSi qua volet regnare diu, contemnat amantem.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cShe who would long retain her power must use her lover ill.\u201d\n      --Ovid, Amor., ii. 19, 33]\n\n                              \u201cContemnite, amantes:\n               Sic hodie veniet, si qua negavit heri.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cSlight your mistress; she will to-day come who denied you\n     yesterday.--\u201cPropertius, ii. 14, 19.]\n\nWhy did Poppea invent the use of a mask to hide the beauties of her face,\nbut to enhance it to her lovers?  Why have they veiled, even below the\nheels, those beauties that every one desires to show, and that every one\ndesires to see?  Why do they cover with so many hindrances, one over\nanother, the parts where our desires and their own have their principal\nseat?  And to what serve those great bastion farthingales, with which our\nladies fortify their haunches, but to allure our appetite and to draw us\non by removing them farther from us?\n\n          \u201cEt fugit ad salices, et se cupit ante videri.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cShe flies to the osiers, and desires beforehand to be seen going.\u201d\n      --Virgil, Eclog., iii. 65.]\n\n               \u201cInterdum tunica duxit operta moram.\u201d\n\n               [\u201cThe hidden robe has sometimes checked love.\u201d\n                --Propertius, ii. 15, 6.]\n\nTo what use serves the artifice of this virgin modesty, this grave\ncoldness, this severe countenance, this professing to be ignorant of\nthings that they know better than we who instruct them in them, but to\nincrease in us the desire to overcome, control, and trample underfoot at\npleasure all this ceremony and all these obstacles?  For there is not\nonly pleasure, but, moreover, glory, in conquering and debauching that\nsoft sweetness and that childish modesty, and to reduce a cold and\nmatronlike gravity to the mercy of our ardent desires: \u2018tis a glory,\nsay they, to triumph over modesty, chastity, and temperance; and whoever\ndissuades ladies from those qualities, betrays both them and himself.\nWe are to believe that their hearts tremble with affright, that the very\nsound of our words offends the purity of their ears, that they hate us\nfor talking so, and only yield to our importunity by a compulsive force.\nBeauty, all powerful as it is, has not wherewithal to make itself\nrelished without the mediation of these little arts.  Look into Italy,\nwhere there is the most and the finest beauty to be sold, how it is\nnecessitated to have recourse to extrinsic means and other artifices to\nrender itself charming, and yet, in truth, whatever it may do, being\nvenal and public, it remains feeble and languishing.  Even so in virtue\nitself, of two like effects, we notwithstanding look upon that as the\nfairest and most worthy, wherein the most trouble and hazard are set\nbefore us.\n\n\u2018Tis an effect of the divine Providence to suffer the holy Church to be\nafflicted, as we see it, with so many storms and troubles, by this\nopposition to rouse pious souls, and to awaken them from that drowsy\nlethargy wherein, by so long tranquillity, they had been immerged.\nIf we should lay the loss we have sustained in the number of those who\nhave gone astray, in the balance against the benefit we have had by being\nagain put in breath, and by having our zeal and strength revived by\nreason of this opposition, I know not whether the utility would not\nsurmount the damage.\n\nWe have thought to tie the nuptial knot of our marriages more fast and\nfirm by having taken away all means of dissolving it, but the knot of the\nwill and affection is so much the more slackened and made loose, by how\nmuch that of constraint is drawn closer; and, on the contrary, that which\nkept the marriages at Rome so long in honour and inviolate, was the\nliberty every one who so desired had to break them; they kept their wives\nthe better, because they might part with them, if they would; and, in the\nfull liberty of divorce, five hundred years and more passed away before\nany one made use on\u2019t.\n\n     \u201cQuod licet, ingratum est; quod non licet, acrius urit.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cWhat you may, is displeasing; what is forbidden, whets the\n     appetite.--\u201cOvid, Amor., ii. 19.]\n\nWe might here introduce the opinion of an ancient upon this occasion,\n\u201cthat executions rather whet than dull the edge of vices: that they do\nnot beget the care of doing well, that being the work of reason and\ndiscipline, but only a care not to be taken in doing ill:\u201d\n\n               \u201cLatius excisae pestis contagia serpunt.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThe plague-sore being lanced, the infection spreads all the more.\u201d\n      --Rutilius, Itinerar. 1, 397.]\n\nI do not know that this is true; but I experimentally know, that never\ncivil government was by that means reformed; the order and regimen of\nmanners depend upon some other expedient.\n\nThe Greek histories make mention of the Argippians, neighbours to\nScythia, who live without either rod or stick for offence; where not only\nno one attempts to attack them, but whoever can fly thither is safe, by\nreason of their virtue and sanctity of life, and no one is so bold as to\nlay hands upon them; and they have applications made to them to determine\nthe controversies that arise betwixt men of other countries.  There is a\ncertain nation, where the enclosures of gardens and fields they would\npreserve, are made only of a string of cotton; and, so fenced, is more\nfirm and secure than by our hedges and ditches.\n\n                    \u201cFurem signata sollicitant .  .  .\n                    aperta effractarius praeterit.\u201d\n\n          [\u201cThings sealed, up invite a thief: the housebreaker\n          passes by open doors.\u201d--Seneca, Epist., 68.]\n\nPeradventure, the facility of entering my house, amongst other things,\nhas been a means to preserve it from the violence of our civil wars:\ndefence allures attempt, and defiance provokes an enemy.  I enervated the\nsoldiers\u2019 design by depriving the exploit of danger and all manner of\nmilitary glory, which is wont to serve them for pretence and excuse:\nwhatever is bravely, is ever honourably, done, at a time when justice is\ndead.  I render them the conquest of my house cowardly and base; it is\nnever shut to any one that knocks; my gate has no other guard than a\nporter, and he of ancient custom and ceremony; who does not so much serve\nto defend it as to offer it with more decorum and grace; I have no other\nguard nor sentinel than the stars.  A gentleman would play the fool to\nmake a show of defence, if he be not really in a condition to defend\nhimself.  He who lies open on one side, is everywhere so; our ancestors\ndid not think of building frontier garrisons.  The means of assaulting,\nI mean without battery or army, and of surprising our houses, increases\nevery day more and more beyond the means to guard them; men\u2019s wits are\ngenerally bent that way; in invasion every one is concerned: none but the\nrich in defence. Mine was strong for the time when it was built; I have\nadded nothing to it of that kind, and should fear that its strength might\nturn against myself; to which we are to consider that a peaceable time\nwould require it should be dismantled.  There is danger never to be able\nto regain it, and it would be very hard to keep; for in intestine\ndissensions, your man may be of the party you fear; and where religion is\nthe pretext, even a man\u2019s nearest relations become unreliable, with some\ncolour of justice. The public exchequer will not maintain our domestic\ngarrisons; they would exhaust it: we ourselves have not the means to do\nit without ruin, or, which is more inconvenient and injurious, without\nruining the people.  The condition of my loss would be scarcely worse.\nAs to the rest, you there lose all; and even your friends will be more\nready to accuse your want of vigilance and your improvidence, and your\nignorance of and indifference to your own business, than to pity you.\nThat so many garrisoned houses have been undone whereas this of mine\nremains, makes me apt to believe that they were only lost by being\nguarded; this gives an enemy both an invitation and colour of reason; all\ndefence shows a face of war.  Let who will come to me in God\u2019s name; but\nI shall not invite them; \u2018tis the retirement I have chosen for my repose\nfrom war.  I endeavour to withdraw this corner from the public tempest,\nas I also do another corner in my soul.  Our war may put on what forms it\nwill, multiply and diversify itself into new parties; for my part, I stir\nnot.  Amongst so many garrisoned houses, myself alone amongst those of my\nrank, so far as I know, in France, have trusted purely to Heaven for the\nprotection of mine, and have never removed plate, deeds, or hangings.\nI will neither fear nor save myself by halves.  If a full acknowledgment\nacquires the Divine favour, it will stay with me to the end: if not, I\nhave still continued long enough to render my continuance remarkable and\nfit to be recorded.  How?  Why, there are thirty years that I have thus\nlived.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nOF GLORY\n\nThere is the name and the thing: the name is a voice which denotes and\nsignifies the thing; the name is no part of the thing, nor of the\nsubstance; \u2018tis a foreign piece joined to the thing, and outside it.\nGod, who is all fulness in Himself and the height of all perfection,\ncannot augment or add anything to Himself within; but His name may be\naugmented and increased by the blessing and praise we attribute to His\nexterior works: which praise, seeing we cannot incorporate it in Him,\nforasmuch as He can have no accession of good, we attribute to His name,\nwhich is the part out of Him that is nearest to us.  Thus is it that to\nGod alone glory and honour appertain; and there is nothing so remote from\nreason as that we should go in quest of it for ourselves; for, being\nindigent and necessitous within, our essence being imperfect, and having\ncontinual need of amelioration, \u2018tis to that we ought to employ all our\nendeavour.  We are all hollow and empty; \u2018tis not with wind and voice\nthat we are to fill ourselves; we want a more solid substance to repair\nus: a man starving with hunger would be very simple to seek rather to\nprovide himself with a gay garment than with a good meal: we are to look\nafter that whereof we have most need.  As we have it in our ordinary\nprayers:\n\n          \u201cGloria in excelsis Deo, et in terra pax hominibus.\u201d\n\nWe are in want of beauty, health, wisdom, virtue, and such like essential\nqualities: exterior ornaments should, be looked after when we have made\nprovision for necessary things.  Divinity treats amply and more\npertinently of this subject, but I am not much versed in it.\n\nChrysippus and Diogenes were the earliest and firmest advocates of the\ncontempt of glory; and maintained that, amongst all pleasures, there was\nnone more dangerous nor more to be avoided than that which proceeds from\nthe approbation of others. And, in truth, experience makes us sensible of\nmany very hurtful treasons in it.  There is nothing that so poisons\nprinces as flattery, nor anything whereby wicked men more easily obtain\ncredit and favour with them; nor panderism so apt and so usually made use\nof to corrupt the chastity of women as to wheedle and entertain them with\ntheir own praises.  The first charm the Syrens made use of to allure\nUlysses is of this nature:\n\n         \u201cDeca vers nous, deca, o tres-louable Ulysse,\n          Et le plus grand honneur don\u2019t la Grece fleurisse.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cCome hither to us, O admirable Ulysses, come hither, thou greatest\n     ornament and pride of Greece.\u201d--Homer, Odysseus, xii. 184.]\n\nThese philosophers said, that all the glory of the world was not worth an\nunderstanding man\u2019s holding out his finger to obtain it:\n\n          \u201cGloria quantalibet quid erit, si gloria tantum est?\u201d\n\n     [\u201cWhat is glory, be it as glorious as it may be, if it be no more\n     than glory?\u201d--Juvenal, Sat., vii. 81.]\n\nI say for it alone; for it often brings several commodities along with\nit, for which it may justly be desired: it acquires us good-will, and\nrenders us less subject and exposed to insult and offence from others,\nand the like.  It was also one of the principal doctrines of Epicurus;\nfor this precept of his sect, Conceal thy life, that forbids men to\nencumber themselves with public negotiations and offices, also\nnecessarily presupposes a contempt of glory, which is the world\u2019s\napprobation of those actions we produce in public.--[Plutarch, Whether\nthe saying, Conceal thy life, is well said.]--He that bids us conceal\nourselves, and to have no other concern but for ourselves, and who will\nnot have us known to others, would much less have us honoured and\nglorified; and so advises Idomeneus not in any sort to regulate his\nactions by the common reputation or opinion, except so as to avoid the\nother accidental inconveniences that the contempt of men might bring upon\nhim.\n\nThese discourses are, in my opinion, very true and rational; but we are,\nI know not how, double in ourselves, which is the cause that what we\nbelieve we do not believe, and cannot disengage ourselves from what we\ncondemn.  Let us see the last and dying words of Epicurus; they are\ngrand, and worthy of such a philosopher, and yet they carry some touches\nof the recommendation of his name and of that humour he had decried by\nhis precepts.  Here is a letter that he dictated a little before his last\ngasp:\n\n                     \u201cEPICUYUS TO HEYMACHUS, health.\n\n     \u201cWhilst I was passing over the happy and last day of my life, I\n     write this, but, at the same time, afflicted with such pain in my\n     bladder and bowels that nothing can be greater, but it was\n     recompensed with the pleasure the remembrance of my inventions and\n     doctrines brought to my soul.  Now, as the affection thou hast ever\n     from thy infancy borne towards me and philosophy requires, take upon\n     thee the protection of Metrodorus\u2019 children.\u201d\n\nThis is the letter.  And that which makes me interpret that the pleasure\nhe says he had in his soul concerning his inventions, has some reference\nto the reputation he hoped for thence after his death, is the manner of\nhis will, in which he gives order that Amynomachus and Timocrates, his\nheirs, should, every January, defray the expense of the celebration of\nhis birthday as Hermachus should appoint; and also the expense that\nshould be made the twentieth of every moon in entertaining the\nphilosophers, his friends, who should assemble in honour of the memory of\nhim and of Metrodorus.--[Cicero, De Finibus, ii. 30.]\n\nCarneades was head of the contrary opinion, and maintained that glory was\nto be desired for itself, even as we embrace our posthumous issue for\nthemselves, having no knowledge nor enjoyment of them.  This opinion has\nnot failed to be the more universally followed, as those commonly are\nthat are most suitable to our inclinations.  Aristotle gives it the first\nplace amongst external goods; and avoids, as too extreme vices, the\nimmoderate either seeking or evading it.  I believe that, if we had the\nbooks Cicero wrote upon this subject, we should there find pretty\nstories; for he was so possessed with this passion, that, if he had\ndared, I think he could willingly have fallen into the excess that others\ndid, that virtue itself was not to be coveted, but upon the account of\nthe honour that always attends it:\n\n                   \u201cPaulum sepultae distat inertiae\n                    Celata virtus:\u201d\n\n          [\u201cVirtue concealed little differs from dead sloth.\u201d\n           --Horace, Od., iv.  9, 29.]\n\nwhich is an opinion so false, that I am vexed it could ever enter into\nthe understanding of a man that was honoured with the name of\nphilosopher.\n\nIf this were true, men need not be virtuous but in public; and we should\nbe no further concerned to keep the operations of the soul, which is the\ntrue seat of virtue, regular and in order, than as they are to arrive at\nthe knowledge of others.  Is there no more in it, then, but only slily\nand with circumspection to do ill?  \u201cIf thou knowest,\u201d says Carneades,\n\u201cof a serpent lurking in a place where, without suspicion, a person is\ngoing to sit down, by whose death thou expectest an advantage, thou dost\nill if thou dost not give him caution of his danger; and so much the more\nbecause the action is to be known by none but thyself.\u201d  If we do not\ntake up of ourselves the rule of well-doing, if impunity pass with us for\njustice, to how many sorts of wickedness shall we every day abandon\nourselves?  I do not find what Sextus Peduceus did, in faithfully\nrestoring the treasure that C. Plotius had committed to his sole secrecy\nand trust, a thing that I have often done myself, so commendable, as I\nshould think it an execrable baseness, had we done otherwise; and I think\nit of good use in our days to recall the example of P. Sextilius Rufus,\nwhom Cicero accuses to have entered upon an inheritance contrary to his\nconscience, not only not against law, but even by the determination of\nthe laws themselves; and M. Crassus and Hortensius, who, by reason of\ntheir authority and power, having been called in by a stranger to share\nin the succession of a forged will, that so he might secure his own part,\nsatisfied themselves with having no hand in the forgery, and refused not\nto make their advantage and to come in for a share: secure enough, if\nthey could shroud themselves from accusations, witnesses, and the\ncognisance of the laws:\n\n          \u201cMeminerint Deum se habere testem, id est (ut ego arbitror)\n          mentem suam.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cLet them consider they have God to witness, that is (as I\n     interpret it), their own consciences.\u201d--Cicero, De Offic., iii. 10.]\n\nVirtue is a very vain and frivolous thing if it derive its recommendation\nfrom glory; and \u2018tis to no purpose that we endeavour to give it a station\nby itself, and separate it from fortune; for what is more accidental than\nreputation?\n\n     \u201cProfecto fortuna in omni re dominatur: ea res cunctas ex\n     libidine magis, quhm ex vero, celebrat, obscuratque.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cFortune rules in all things; it advances and depresses things\n     more out of its own will than of right and justice.\u201d\n      --Sallust, Catilina, c. 8.]\n\nSo to order it that actions may be known and seen is purely the work of\nfortune; \u2018tis chance that helps us to glory, according to its own\ntemerity.  I have often seen her go before merit, and often very much\noutstrip it.  He who first likened glory to a shadow did better than he\nwas aware of; they are both of them things pre-eminently vain glory also,\nlike a shadow, goes sometimes before the body, and sometimes in length\ninfinitely exceeds it.  They who instruct gentlemen only to employ their\nvalour for the obtaining of honour:\n\n          \u201cQuasi non sit honestum, quod nobilitatum non sit;\u201d\n\n          [\u201cAs though it were not a virtue, unless celebrated\u201d\n           --Cicero De Offic. iii. 10.]\n\nwhat do they intend by that but to instruct them never to hazard\nthemselves if they are not seen, and to observe well if there be\nwitnesses present who may carry news of their valour, whereas a thousand\noccasions of well-doing present themselves which cannot be taken notice\nof?  How many brave individual actions are buried in the crowd of a\nbattle?  Whoever shall take upon him to watch another\u2019s behaviour in such\na confusion is not very busy himself, and the testimony he shall give of\nhis companions\u2019 deportment will be evidence against himself:\n\n          \u201cVera et sapiens animi magnitudo, honestum illud,\n          quod maxime naturam sequitur, in factis positum,\n          non in gloria, judicat.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThe true and wise magnanimity judges that the bravery which most\n     follows nature more consists in act than glory.\u201d\n      --Cicero, De Offic. i. 19.]\n\nAll the glory that I pretend to derive from my life is that I have lived\nit in quiet; in quiet, not according to Metrodorus, or Arcesilaus, or\nAristippus, but according to myself.  For seeing philosophy has not been\nable to find out any way to tranquillity that is good in common, let\nevery one seek it in particular.\n\nTo what do Caesar and Alexander owe the infinite grandeur of their renown\nbut to fortune?  How many men has she extinguished in the beginning of\ntheir progress, of whom we have no knowledge, who brought as much courage\nto the work as they, if their adverse hap had not cut them off in the\nfirst sally of their arms?  Amongst so many and so great dangers I do not\nremember I have anywhere read that Caesar was ever wounded; a thousand\nhave fallen in less dangers than the least of those he went through.  An\ninfinite number of brave actions must be performed without witness and\nlost, before one turns to account.  A man is not always on the top of a\nbreach, or at the head of an army, in the sight of his general, as upon a\nscaffold; a man is often surprised betwixt the hedge and the ditch; he\nmust run the hazard of his life against a henroost; he must dislodge four\nrascally musketeers out of a barn; he must prick out single from his\nparty, and alone make some attempts, according as necessity will have it.\nAnd whoever will observe will, I believe, find it experimentally true,\nthat occasions of the least lustre are ever the most dangerous; and that\nin the wars of our own times there have more brave men been lost in\noccasions of little moment, and in the dispute about some little paltry\nfort, than in places of greatest importance, and where their valour might\nhave been more honourably employed.\n\nWho thinks his death achieved to ill purpose if he do not fall on some\nsignal occasion, instead of illustrating his death, wilfully obscures his\nlife, suffering in the meantime many very just occasions of hazarding\nhimself to slip out of his hands; and every just one is illustrious\nenough, every man\u2019s conscience being a sufficient trumpet to him.\n\n          \u201cGloria nostra est testimonium conscientiae nostrae.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cFor our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience.\u201d\n      --Corinthians, i. I.]\n\nHe who is only a good man that men may know it, and that he may be the\nbetter esteemed when \u2018tis known; who will not do well but upon condition\nthat his virtue may be known to men: is one from whom much service is not\nto be expected:\n\n              \u201cCredo ch \u2018el reste di quel verno, cose\n               Facesse degne di tener ne conto;\n               Ma fur fin\u2019 a quel tempo si nascose,\n               Che non a colpa mia s\u2019 hor \u2018non le conto\n               Perche Orlando a far l\u2019opre virtuose\n               Piu ch\u2019a narrar le poi sempre era pronto;\n               Ne mai fu alcun\u2019 de\u2019suoi fatti espresso,\n               Se non quando ebbe i testimonii appresso.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThe rest of the winter, I believe, was spent in actions worthy of\n     narration, but they were done so secretly that if I do not tell them\n     I am not to blame, for Orlando was more bent to do great acts than\n     to boast of them, so that no deeds of his were ever known but those\n     that had witnesses.\u201d--Ariosto, Orlando Furioso, xi. 81.]\n\nA man must go to the war upon the account of duty, and expect the\nrecompense that never fails brave and worthy actions, how private soever,\nor even virtuous thoughts-the satisfaction that a well-disposed\nconscience receives in itself in doing well.  A man must be valiant for\nhimself, and upon account of the advantage it is to him to have his\ncourage seated in a firm and secure place against the assaults of\nfortune:\n\n                   \u201cVirtus, repulsaa nescia sordidx\n                    Intaminatis fulget honoribus\n                    Nec sumit, aut ponit secures\n                    Arbitrio popularis aura.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cVirtue, repudiating all base repulse, shines in taintless\n     honours, nor takes nor leaves dignity at the mere will of the\n     vulgar.\u201d--Horace, Od., iii. 2, 17.]\n\nIt is not for outward show that the soul is to play its part, but for\nourselves within, where no eyes can pierce but our own; there she defends\nus from the fear of death, of pain, of shame itself: there she arms us\nagainst the loss of our children, friends, and fortunes: and when\nopportunity presents itself, she leads us on to the hazards of war:\n\n          \u201cNon emolumento aliquo, sed ipsius honestatis decore.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cNot for any profit, but for the honour of honesty itself.\u201d\n      --Cicero, De Finib., i. 10.]\n\nThis profit is of much greater advantage, and more worthy to be coveted\nand hoped for, than, honour and glory, which are no other than a\nfavourable judgment given of us.\n\nA dozen men must be called out of a whole nation to judge about an acre\nof land; and the judgment of our inclinations and actions, the most\ndifficult and most important matter that is, we refer to the voice and\ndetermination of the rabble, the mother of ignorance, injustice, and\ninconstancy.  Is it reasonable that the life of a wise man should\ndepend upon the judgment of fools?\n\n          \u201cAn quidquam stultius, quam, quos singulos contemnas,\n          eos aliquid putare esse universes?\u201d\n\n     [\u201cCan anything be more foolish than to think that those you despise\n     singly, can be anything else in general.\u201d\n      --Cicero, Tusc. Quaes., v. 36.]\n\nHe that makes it his business to please them, will have enough to do and\nnever have done; \u2018tis a mark that can never be aimed at or hit:\n\n          \u201cNil tam inaestimabile est, quam animi multitudinis.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cNothing is to be so little understood as the minds of the\n     multitude.\u201d--Livy, xxxi. 34.]\n\nDemetrius pleasantly said of the voice of the people, that he made no\nmore account of that which came from above than of that which came from\nbelow.  He [Cicero] says more:\n\n          \u201cEgo hoc judico, si quando turpe non sit, tamen non\n          esse non turpe, quum id a multitudine laudatur.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cI am of opinion, that though a thing be not foul in itself,\n     yet it cannot but become so when commended by the multitude.\u201d\n      --Cicero, De Finib., ii. 15.]\n\nNo art, no activity of wit, could conduct our steps so as to follow so\nwandering and so irregular a guide; in this windy confusion of the noise\nof vulgar reports and opinions that drive us on, no way worth anything\ncan be chosen.  Let us not propose to ourselves so floating and wavering\nan end; let us follow constantly after reason; let the public approbation\nfollow us there, if it will; and as it wholly depends upon fortune, we\nhave no reason sooner to expect it by any other way than that.  Even\nthough I would not follow the right way because it is right, I should,\nhowever, follow it as having experimentally found that, at the end of\nthe reckoning, \u2018tis commonly the most happy and of greatest utility.\n\n              \u201cDedit hoc providentia hominibus munus,\n               ut honesta magis juvarent.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThis gift Providence has given to men, that honest things should\n     be the most agreeable.\u201d--Quintilian, Inst. Orat., i. 12.]\n\nThe mariner of old said thus to Neptune, in a great tempest: \u201cO God, thou\nwilt save me if thou wilt, and if thou choosest, thou wilt destroy me;\nbut, however, I will hold my rudder straight.\u201d--[Seneca, Ep., 85.]--\nI have seen in my time a thousand men supple, halfbred, ambiguous, whom\nno one doubted to be more worldly-wise than I, lose themselves, where I\nhave saved myself:\n\n               \u201cRisi successus posse carere dolos.\u201d\n\n          [\u201cI have laughed to see cunning fail of success.\u201d\n           --Ovid, Heroid, i. 18.]\n\nPaulus AEmilius, going on the glorious expedition of Macedonia, above all\nthings charged the people of Rome not to speak of his actions during his\nabsence.  Oh, the license of judgments is a great disturbance to great\naffairs!  forasmuch as every one has not the firmness of Fabius against\ncommon, adverse, and injurious tongues, who rather suffered his authority\nto be dissected by the vain fancies of men, than to do less well in his\ncharge with a favourable reputation and the popular applause.\n\nThere is I know not what natural sweetness in hearing one\u2019s self\ncommended; but we are a great deal too fond of it:\n\n         \u201cLaudari metuam, neque enim mihi cornea fibra est\n          Sed recti finemque extremumque esse recuso\n          Euge tuum, et belle.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cI should fear to be praised, for my heart is not made of horn;\n     but I deny that \u2018excellent--admirably done,\u2019 are the terms and\n     final aim of virtue.\u201d--Persius, i. 47.]\n\nI care not so much what I am in the opinions of others, as what I am in\nmy own; I would be rich of myself, and not by borrowing.  Strangers see\nnothing but events and outward appearances; everybody can set a good face\non the matter, when they have trembling and terror within: they do not\nsee my heart, they see but my countenance.  One is right in decrying the\nhypocrisy that is in war; for what is more easy to an old soldier than to\nshift in a time of danger, and to counterfeit the brave when he has no\nmore heart than a chicken?  There are so many ways to avoid hazarding a\nman\u2019s own person, that we have deceived the world a thousand times before\nwe come to be engaged in a real danger: and even then, finding ourselves\nin an inevitable necessity of doing something, we can make shift for that\ntime to conceal our apprehensions by setting a good face on the business,\nthough the heart beats within; and whoever had the use of the Platonic\nring, which renders those invisible that wear it, if turned inward\ntowards the palm of the hand, a great many would very often hide\nthemselves when they ought most to appear, and would repent being placed\nin so honourable a post, where necessity must make them bold.\n\n              \u201cFalsus honor juvat, et mendax infamia terret\n               Quem nisi mendosum et mendacem?\u201d\n\n          [\u201cFalse honour pleases, and calumny affrights, the guilty\n          and the sick.\u201d--Horace, Ep., i. 16, 89.]\n\nThus we see how all the judgments that are founded upon external\nappearances, are marvellously uncertain and doubtful; and that there is\nno so certain testimony as every one is to himself.  In these, how many\nsoldiers\u2019 boys are companions of our glory?  he who stands firm in an\nopen trench, what does he in that more than fifty poor pioneers who open\nto him the way and cover it with their own bodies for fivepence a day\npay, do before him?\n\n              \u201cNon quicquid turbida Roma\n               Elevet, accedas; examenque improbum in illa\n               Castiges trutina: nec to quaesiveris extra.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cDo not, if turbulent Rome disparage anything, accede; nor correct\n     a false balance by that scale; nor seek anything beyond thyself.\u201d\n      --Persius, Sat., i. 5.]\n\nThe dispersing and scattering our names into many mouths, we call making\nthem more great; we will have them there well received, and that this\nincrease turn to their advantage, which is all that can be excusable in\nthis design.  But the excess of this disease proceeds so far that many\ncovet to have a name, be it what it will.  Trogus Pompeius says of\nHerostratus, and Titus Livius of Manlius Capitolinus, that they were more\nambitious of a great reputation than of a good one.  This is very common;\nwe are more solicitous that men speak of us, than how they speak; and it\nis enough for us that our names are often mentioned, be it after what\nmanner it will.  It should seem that to be known, is in some sort to have\na man\u2019s life and its duration in others\u2019 keeping.  I, for my part, hold\nthat I am not, but in myself; and of that other life of mine which lies\nin the knowledge of my friends, to consider it naked and simply in\nitself, I know very well that I am sensible of no fruit nor enjoyment\nfrom it but by the vanity of a fantastic opinion; and when I shall be\ndead, I shall be still and much less sensible of it; and shall, withal,\nabsolutely lose the use of those real advantages that sometimes\naccidentally follow it.\n\nI shall have no more handle whereby to take hold of reputation, neither\nshall it have any whereby to take hold of or to cleave to me; for to\nexpect that my name should be advanced by it, in the first place, I have\nno name that is enough my own; of two that I have, one is common to all\nmy race, and indeed to others also; there are two families at Paris and\nMontpellier, whose surname is Montaigne, another in Brittany, and one in\nXaintonge, De La Montaigne.  The transposition of one syllable only would\nsuffice so to ravel our affairs, that I shall share in their glory, and\nthey peradventure will partake of my discredit; and, moreover, my\nancestors have formerly been surnamed, Eyquem,--[Eyquem was the\npatronymic.]--a name wherein a family well known in England is at this\nday concerned.  As to my other name, every one may take it that will, and\nso, perhaps, I may honour a porter in my own stead.  And besides, though\nI had a particular distinction by myself, what can it distinguish, when I\nam no more?  Can it point out and favour inanity?\n\n              \u201cNon levior cippus nunc imprimit ossa?\n               Laudat posteritas!  Nunc non e manibus illis,\n               Nunc non a tumulo fortunataque favilla,\n               Nascentur violae?\u201d\n\n     [\u201cDoes the tomb press with less weight upon my bones?  Do comrades\n     praise?  Not from my manes, not from the tomb, not from the ashes\n     will violets grow.\u201d--Persius, Sat., i. 37.]\n\nbut of this I have spoken elsewhere.  As to what remains, in a great\nbattle where ten thousand men are maimed or killed, there are not fifteen\nwho are taken notice of; it must be some very eminent greatness, or some\nconsequence of great importance that fortune has added to it, that\nsignalises a private action, not of a harquebuser only, but of a great\ncaptain; for to kill a man, or two, or ten: to expose a man\u2019s self\nbravely to the utmost peril of death, is indeed something in every one of\nus, because we there hazard all; but for the world\u2019s concern, they are\nthings so ordinary, and so many of them are every day seen, and there\nmust of necessity be so many of the same kind to produce any notable\neffect, that we cannot expect any particular renown from it:\n\n              \u201cCasus multis hic cognitus, ac jam\n               Tritus, et a medio fortunae ductus acervo.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThe accident is known to many, and now trite; and drawn from the\n     midst of Fortune\u2019s heap.\u201d--Juvenal, Sat., xiii. 9.]\n\nOf so many thousands of valiant men who have died within these fifteen\nhundred years in France with their swords in their hands, not a hundred\nhave come to our knowledge.  The memory, not of the commanders only, but\nof battles and victories, is buried and gone; the fortunes of above half\nof the world, for want of a record, stir not from their place, and vanish\nwithout duration.  If I had unknown events in my possession, I should\nthink with great ease to out-do those that are recorded, in all sorts of\nexamples.  Is it not strange that even of the Greeks and Romans, with so\nmany writers and witnesses, and so many rare and noble exploits, so few\nare arrived at our knowledge:\n\n               \u201cAd nos vix tenuis famx perlabitur aura.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cAn obscure rumour scarce is hither come.\u201d--AEneid, vii. 646.]\n\nIt will be much if, a hundred years hence, it be remembered in general\nthat in our times there were civil wars in France.  The Lacedaemonians,\nentering into battle, sacrificed to the Muses, to the end that their\nactions might be well and worthily written, looking upon it as a divine\nand no common favour, that brave acts should find witnesses that could\ngive them life and memory.  Do we expect that at every musket-shot we\nreceive, and at every hazard we run, there must be a register ready to\nrecord it?  and, besides, a hundred registers may enrol them whose\ncommentaries will not last above three days, and will never come to the\nsight of any one.  We have not the thousandth part of ancient writings;\n\u2018tis fortune that gives them a shorter or longer life, according to her\nfavour; and \u2018tis permissible to doubt whether those we have be not the\nworst, not having seen the rest.  Men do not write histories of things of\nso little moment: a man must have been general in the conquest of an\nempire or a kingdom; he must have won two-and-fifty set battles, and\nalways the weaker in number, as Caesar did: ten thousand brave fellows\nand many great captains lost their lives valiantly in his service, whose\nnames lasted no longer than their wives and children lived:\n\n                    \u201cQuos fama obscura recondit.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cWhom an obscure reputation conceals.\u201d--AEneid, v. 302.]\n\nEven those whom we see behave themselves well, three months or three\nyears after they have departed hence, are no more mentioned than if they\nhad never been.  Whoever will justly consider, and with due proportion,\nof what kind of men and of what sort of actions the glory sustains itself\nin the records of history, will find that there are very few actions and\nvery few persons of our times who can there pretend any right.  How many\nworthy men have we known to survive their own reputation, who have seen\nand suffered the honour and glory most justly acquired in their youth,\nextinguished in their own presence?  And for three years of this\nfantastic and imaginary life we must go and throw away our true and\nessential life, and engage ourselves in a perpetual death!  The sages\npropose to themselves a nobler and more just end in so important an\nenterprise:\n\n          \u201cRecte facti, fecisse merces est: officii fructus,\n          ipsum officium est.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThe reward of a thing well done is to have done it; the fruit\n     of a good service is the service itself.\u201d--Seneca, Ep., 8.]\n\nIt were, peradventure, excusable in a painter or other artisan, or in a\nrhetorician or a grammarian, to endeavour to raise himself a name by his\nworks; but the actions of virtue are too noble in themselves to seek any\nother reward than from their own value, and especially to seek it in the\nvanity of human judgments.\n\nIf this false opinion, nevertheless, be of such use to the public as to\nkeep men in their duty; if the people are thereby stirred up to virtue;\nif princes are touched to see the world bless the memory of Trajan, and\nabominate that of Nero; if it moves them to see the name of that great\nbeast, once so terrible and feared, so freely cursed and reviled by every\nschoolboy, let it by all means increase, and be as much as possible\nnursed up and cherished amongst us; and Plato, bending his whole\nendeavour to make his citizens virtuous, also advises them not to despise\nthe good repute and esteem of the people; and says it falls out, by a\ncertain Divine inspiration, that even the wicked themselves oft-times, as\nwell by word as opinion, can rightly distinguish the virtuous from the\nwicked.  This person and his tutor are both marvellous and bold\nartificers everywhere to add divine operations and revelations where\nhuman force is wanting:\n\n          \u201cUt tragici poetae confugiunt ad deum,\n          cum explicare argumenti exitum non possunt:\u201d\n\n     [\u201cAs tragic poets fly to some god when they cannot explain\n     the issue of their argument.\u201d--Cicero, De Nat. Deor., i. 20.]\n\nand peradventure, for this reason it was that Timon, railing at him,\ncalled him the great forger of miracles.  Seeing that men, by their\ninsufficiency, cannot pay themselves well enough with current money, let\nthe counterfeit be superadded.  \u2018Tis a way that has been practised by all\nthe legislators: and there is no government that has not some mixture\neither of ceremonial vanity or of false opinion, that serves for a curb\nto keep the people in their duty.  \u2018Tis for this that most of them have\ntheir originals and beginnings fabulous, and enriched with supernatural\nmysteries; \u2018tis this that has given credit to bastard religions, and\ncaused them to be countenanced by men of understanding; and for this,\nthat Numa and Sertorius, to possess their men with a better opinion of\nthem, fed them with this foppery; one, that the nymph Egeria, the other\nthat his white hind, brought them all their counsels from the gods.\nAnd the authority that Numa gave to his laws, under the title of the\npatronage of this goddess, Zoroaster, legislator of the Bactrians and\nPersians, gave to his under the name of the God Oromazis: Trismegistus,\nlegislator of the Egyptians, under that of Mercury; Xamolxis, legislator\nof the Scythians, under that of Vesta; Charondas, legislator of the\nChalcidians, under that of Saturn; Minos, legislator of the Candiots,\nunder that of Jupiter; Lycurgus, legislator of the Lacedaemonians, under\nthat of Apollo; and Draco and Solon, legislators of the Athenians, under\nthat of Minerva.  And every government has a god at the head of it;\nthe others falsely, that truly, which Moses set over the Jews at their\ndeparture out of Egypt.  The religion of the Bedouins, as the Sire de\nJoinville reports, amongst other things, enjoined a belief that the soul\nof him amongst them who died for his prince, went into another body more\nhappy, more beautiful, and more robust than the former; by which means\nthey much more willingly ventured their lives:\n\n         \u201cIn ferrum mens prona viris, animaeque capaces\n          Mortis, et ignavum est rediturae parcere vitae.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cMen\u2019s minds are prone to the sword, and their souls able to bear\n     death; and it is base to spare a life that will be renewed.\u201d\n      --Lucan, i. 461.]\n\nThis is a very comfortable belief, however erroneous.  Every nation has\nmany such examples of its own; but this subject would require a treatise\nby itself.\n\nTo add one word more to my former discourse, I would advise the ladies no\nlonger to call that honour which is but their duty:\n\n          \u201cUt enim consuetudo loquitur, id solum dicitur\n          honestum, quod est populari fama gloriosum;\u201d\n\n     [\u201cAs custom puts it, that only is called honest which is\n     glorious by the public voice.\u201d--Cicero, De Finibus, ii. 15.]\n\ntheir duty is the mark, their honour but the outward rind.  Neither would\nI advise them to give this excuse for payment of their denial: for I\npresuppose that their intentions, their desire, and will, which are\nthings wherein their honour is not at all concerned, forasmuch as nothing\nthereof appears without, are much better regulated than the effects:\n\n          \u201cQux quia non liceat, non facit, illa facit:\u201d\n\n     [\u201cShe who only refuses, because \u2018tis forbidden, consents.\u201d\n      --Ovid, Amor., ii. 4, 4.]\n\nThe offence, both towards God and in the conscience, would be as great to\ndesire as to do it; and, besides, they are actions so private and secret\nof themselves, as would be easily enough kept from the knowledge of\nothers, wherein the honour consists, if they had not another respect to\ntheir duty, and the affection they bear to chastity, for itself.  Every\nwoman of honour will much rather choose to lose her honour than to hurt\nher conscience.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nOF PRESUMPTION\n\nThere is another sort of glory, which is the having too good an opinion\nof our own worth.  \u2018Tis an inconsiderate affection with which we flatter\nourselves, and that represents us to ourselves other than we truly are:\nlike the passion of love, that lends beauties and graces to the object,\nand makes those who are caught by it, with a depraved and corrupt\njudgment, consider the thing which they love other and more perfect than\nit is.\n\nI would not, nevertheless, for fear of failing on this side, that a man\nshould not know himself aright, or think himself less than he is; the\njudgment ought in all things to maintain its rights; \u2018tis all the reason\nin the world he should discern in himself, as well as in others, what\ntruth sets before him; if it be Caesar, let him boldly think himself the\ngreatest captain in the world.  We are nothing but ceremony: ceremony\ncarries us away, and we leave the substance of things: we hold by the\nbranches, and quit the trunk and the body; we have taught the ladies to\nblush when they hear that but named which they are not at all afraid to\ndo: we dare not call our members by their right names, yet are not afraid\nto employ them in all sorts of debauchery: ceremony forbids us to express\nby words things that are lawful and natural, and we obey it: reason\nforbids us to do things unlawful and ill, and nobody obeys it.  I find\nmyself here fettered by the laws of ceremony; for it neither permits a\nman to speak well of himself, nor ill: we will leave her there for this\ntime.\n\nThey whom fortune (call it good or ill) has made to, pass their lives in\nsome eminent degree, may by their public actions manifest what they are;\nbut they whom she has only employed in the crowd, and of whom nobody will\nsay a word unless they speak themselves, are to be excused if they take\nthe boldness to speak of themselves to such as are interested to know\nthem; by the example of Lucilius:\n\n              \u201cIlle velut fidis arcana sodalibus olim\n               Credebat libris, neque si male cesserat, usquam\n               Decurrens alio, neque si bene: quo fit, ut omnis,\n               Votiva pateat veluri descripta tabella\n               Vita senis;\u201d\n\n     [\u201cHe formerly confided his secret thoughts to his books, as to tried\n     friends, and for good and evil, resorted not elsewhere: hence it\n     came to pass, that the old man\u2019s life is there all seen as on a\n     votive tablet.\u201d--Horace, Sat., ii. I, 30.]\n\nhe always committed to paper his actions and thoughts, and there\nportrayed himself such as he found himself to be:\n\n     \u201cNec id Rutilio et Scauro citra fidem; aut obtrectationi fuit.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cNor was this considered a breach of good faith or a disparagement\n     to Rutilius or Scaurus.\u201d--Tacitus, Agricola, c. I.]\n\nI remember, then, that from my infancy there was observed in me I know\nnot what kind of carriage and behaviour, that seemed to relish of pride\nand arrogance.  I will say this, by the way, that it is not unreasonable\nto suppose that we have qualities and inclinations so much our own, and\nso incorporate in us, that we have not the means to feel and recognise\nthem: and of such natural inclinations the body will retain a certain\nbent, without our knowledge or consent.  It was an affectation\nconformable with his beauty that made Alexander carry his head on one\nside, and caused Alcibiades to lisp; Julius Caesar scratched his head\nwith one finger,  which is the fashion of a man full of troublesome\nthoughts; and Cicero, as I remember, was wont to pucker up his nose, a\nsign of a man given to scoffing; such motions as these may imperceptibly\nhappen in us.  There are other artificial ones which I meddle not with,\nas salutations and congees, by which men acquire, for the most part\nunjustly, the reputation of being humble and courteous: one may be humble\nout of pride.  I am prodigal enough of my hat, especially in summer, and\nnever am so saluted but that I pay it again from persons of what quality\nsoever, unless they be in my own service.  I should make it my request to\nsome princes whom I know, that they would be more sparing of that\nceremony, and bestow that courtesy where it is more due; for being so\nindiscreetly and indifferently conferred on all, it is thrown away to no\npurpose; if it be without respect of persons, it loses its effect.\nAmongst irregular deportment, let us not forget that haughty one of the\nEmperor Constantius, who always in public held his head upright and\nstiff, without bending or turning on either side, not so much as to look\nupon those who saluted him on one side, planting his body in a rigid\nimmovable posture, without suffering it to yield to the motion of his\ncoach, not daring so much as to spit, blow his nose, or wipe his face\nbefore people.  I know not whether the gestures that were observed in me\nwere of this first quality, and whether I had really any occult proneness\nto this vice, as it might well be; and I cannot be responsible for the\nmotions of the body; but as to the motions of the soul, I must here\nconfess what I think of the matter.\n\nThis glory consists of two parts; the one in setting too great a value\nupon ourselves, and the other in setting too little a value upon others.\nAs to the one, methinks these considerations ought, in the first place,\nto be of some force: I feel myself importuned by an error of the soul\nthat displeases me, both as it is unjust, and still more as it is\ntroublesome; I attempt to correct it, but I cannot root it out; and this\nis, that I lessen the just value of things that I possess, and overvalue\nthings, because they are foreign, absent, and none of mine; this humour\nspreads very far.  As the prerogative of the authority makes husbands\nlook upon their own wives with a vicious disdain, and many fathers their\nchildren; so I, betwixt two equal merits, should always be swayed against\nmy own; not so much that the jealousy of my advancement and bettering\ntroubles my judgment, and hinders me from satisfying myself, as that of\nitself possession begets a contempt of what it holds and rules.  Foreign\ngovernments, manners, and languages insinuate themselves into my esteem;\nand I am sensible that Latin allures me by the favour of its dignity to\nvalue it above its due, as it does with children, and the common sort of\npeople: the domestic government, house, horse, of my neighbour, though no\nbetter than my own, I prize above my own, because they are not mine.\nBesides that I am very ignorant in my own affairs, I am struck by the\nassurance that every one has of himself: whereas there is scarcely\nanything that I am sure I know, or that I dare be responsible to myself\nthat I can do: I have not my means of doing anything in condition and\nready, and am only instructed therein after the effect; as doubtful of my\nown force as I am of another\u2019s.  Whence it comes to pass that if I happen\nto do anything commendable, I attribute it more to my fortune than\nindustry, forasmuch as I design everything by chance and in fear.  I have\nthis, also, in general, that of all the opinions antiquity has held of\nmen in gross, I most willingly embrace and adhere to those that most\ncontemn and undervalue us, and most push us to naught; methinks,\nphilosophy has never so fair a game to play as when it falls upon our\nvanity and presumption; when it most lays open our irresolution,\nweakness, and ignorance.  I look upon the too good opinion that man has\nof himself to be the nursing mother of all the most false opinions, both\npublic and private.  Those people who ride astride upon the epicycle of\nMercury, who see so far into the heavens, are worse to me than a\ntooth-drawer that comes to draw my teeth; for in my study, the subject of\nwhich is man, finding so great a variety of judgments, so profound a\nlabyrinth of difficulties, one upon another, so great diversity and\nuncertainty, even in the school of wisdom itself, you may judge, seeing\nthese people could not resolve upon the knowledge of themselves and their\nown condition, which is continually before their eyes, and within them,\nseeing they do not know how that moves which they themselves move, nor\nhow to give us a description of the springs they themselves govern and\nmake use of, how can I believe them about the ebbing and flowing of the\nNile?  The curiosity of knowing things has been given to man for a\nscourge, says the Holy Scripture.\n\nBut to return to what concerns myself; I think it would be very difficult\nfor any other man to have a meaner opinion of himself; nay, for any other\nto have a meaner opinion of me than of myself: I look upon myself as one\nof the common sort, saving in this, that I have no better an opinion of\nmyself; guilty of the meanest and most popular defects, but not disowning\nor excusing them; and I do not value myself upon any other account than\nbecause I know my own value.  If there be any vanity in the case, \u2018tis\nsuperficially infused into me by the treachery of my complexion, and has\nno body that my judgment can discern: I am sprinkled, but not dyed.  For\nin truth, as to the effects of the mind, there is no part of me, be it\nwhat it will, with which I am satisfied; and the approbation of others\nmakes me not think the better of myself.  My judgment is tender and nice,\nespecially in things that concern myself.\n\nI ever repudiate myself, and feel myself float and waver by reason of my\nweakness.  I have nothing of my own that satisfies my judgment.  My sight\nis clear and regular enough, but, at working, it is apt to dazzle; as I\nmost manifestly find in poetry: I love it infinitely, and am able to give\na tolerable judgment of other men\u2019s works; but, in good earnest, when I\napply myself to it, I play the child, and am not able to endure myself.\nA man may play the fool in everything else, but not in poetry;\n\n                         \u201cMediocribus esse poetis\n          Non dii, non homines, non concessere columnae.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cNeither men, nor gods, nor the pillars (on which the poets\n     offered their writings) permit mediocrity in poets.\u201d\n      --Horace, De Arte Poet., 372.]\n\nI would to God this sentence was written over the doors of all our\nprinters, to forbid the entrance of so many rhymesters!\n\n                    \u201cVerum\n                    Nihil securius est malo poetae.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThe truth is, that nothing is more confident than a bad poet.\u201d\n      --Martial, xii. 63, 13.]\n\nWhy have not we such people?--[As those about to be mentioned.]--\nDionysius the father valued himself upon nothing so much as his poetry;\nat the Olympic games, with chariots surpassing all the others in\nmagnificence, he sent also poets and musicians to present his verses,\nwith tent and pavilions royally gilt and hung with tapestry.  When his\nverses came to be recited, the excellence of the delivery at first\nattracted the attention of the people; but when they afterwards came to\npoise the meanness of the composition, they first entered into disdain,\nand continuing to nettle their judgments, presently proceeded to fury,\nand ran to pull down and tear to pieces all his pavilions: and, that his\nchariots neither performed anything to purpose in the race, and that the\nship which brought back his people failed of making Sicily, and was by\nthe tempest driven and wrecked upon the coast of Tarentum, they certainly\nbelieved was through the anger of the gods, incensed, as they themselves\nwere, against the paltry Poem; and even the mariners who escaped from the\nwreck seconded this opinion of the people: to which also the oracle that\nforetold his death seemed to subscribe; which was, \u201cthat Dionysius should\nbe near his end, when he should have overcome those who were better than\nhimself,\u201d which he interpreted of the Carthaginians, who surpassed him in\npower; and having war with them, often declined the victory, not to incur\nthe sense of this prediction; but he understood it ill; for the god\nindicated the time of the advantage, that by favour and injustice he\nobtained at Athens over the tragic poets, better than himself, having\ncaused his own play called the Leneians to be acted in emulation;\npresently after which victory he died, and partly of the excessive joy he\nconceived at the success.\n\n     [Diodorus Siculus, xv. 7.--The play, however, was called the\n     \u201cRansom of Hector.\u201d  It was the games at which it was acted that\n     were called Leneian; they were one of the four Dionysiac festivals.]\n\nWhat I find tolerable of mine, is not so really and in itself, but in\ncomparison of other worse things, that I see well enough received.  I\nenvy the happiness of those who can please and hug themselves in what\nthey do; for \u2018tis an easy thing to be so pleased, because a man extracts\nthat pleasure from himself, especially if he be constant in his\nself-conceit.  I know a poet, against whom the intelligent and the\nignorant, abroad and at home, both heaven and earth exclaim that he has\nbut very little notion of it; and yet, for all that, he has never a whit\nthe worse opinion of himself; but is always falling upon some new piece,\nalways contriving some new invention, and still persists in his opinion,\nby so much the more obstinately, as it only concerns him to maintain it.\n\nMy works are so far from pleasing me, that as often as I review them,\nthey disgust me:\n\n         \u201cCum relego, scripsisse pudet; quia plurima cerno,\n          Me quoque, qui feci, judice, digna lini.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cWhen I reperuse, I blush at what I have written; I ever see one\n     passage after another that I, the author, being the judge, consider\n     should be erased.\u201d--Ovid, De Ponto, i. 5, 15.]\n\nI have always an idea in my soul, and a sort of disturbed image which\npresents me as in a dream with a better form than that I have made use\nof; but I cannot catch it nor fit it to my purpose; and even that idea is\nbut of the meaner sort.  Hence I conclude that the productions of those\ngreat and rich souls of former times are very much beyond the utmost\nstretch of my imagination or my wish; their writings do not only satisfy\nand fill me, but they astound me, and ravish me with admiration; I judge\nof their beauty; I see it, if not to the utmost, yet so far at least as\n\u2018tis possible for me to aspire.  Whatever I undertake, I owe a sacrifice\nto the Graces, as Plutarch says of some one, to conciliate their favour:\n\n                   \u201cSi quid enim placet,\n                    Si quid dulce horninum sensibus influit,\n                    Debentur lepidis omnia Gratiis.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cIf anything please that I write, if it infuse delight into men\u2019s\n     minds, all is due to the charming Graces.\u201d  The verses are probably\n     by some modern poet.]\n\nThey abandon me throughout; all I write is rude; polish and beauty are\nwanting: I cannot set things off to any advantage; my handling adds\nnothing to the matter; for which reason I must have it forcible, very\nfull, and that has lustre of its own.  If I pitch upon subjects that are\npopular and gay, \u2018tis to follow my own inclination, who do not affect a\ngrave and ceremonious wisdom, as the world does; and to make myself more\nsprightly, but not my style more wanton, which would rather have them\ngrave and severe; at least if I may call that a style which is an inform\nand irregular way of speaking, a popular jargon, a proceeding without\ndefinition, division, conclusion, perplexed like that Amafanius and\nRabirius.--[Cicero, Acad., i. 2.]--I can neither please nor delight,\nnor even tickle my readers: the best story in the world is spoiled by my\nhandling, and becomes flat; I cannot speak but in rough earnest, and am\ntotally unprovided of that facility which I observe in many of my\nacquaintance, of entertaining the first comers and keeping a whole\ncompany in breath, or taking up the ear of a prince with all sorts of\ndiscourse without wearying themselves: they never want matter by reason\nof the faculty and grace they have in taking hold of the first thing that\nstarts up, and accommodating it to the humour and capacity of those with\nwhom they have to do.  Princes do not much affect solid discourses, nor I\nto tell stories.  The first and easiest reasons, which are commonly the\nbest taken, I know not how to employ: I am an ill orator to the common\nsort.  I am apt of everything to say the extremest that I know.  Cicero\nis of opinion that in treatises of philosophy the exordium is the hardest\npart; if this be true, I am wise in sticking to the conclusion.  And yet\nwe are to know how to wind the string to all notes, and the sharpest is\nthat which is the most seldom touched.  There is at least as much\nperfection in elevating an empty as in supporting a weighty thing.  A man\nmust sometimes superficially handle things, and sometimes push them home.\nI know very well that most men keep themselves in this lower form from\nnot conceiving things otherwise than by this outward bark; but I likewise\nknow that the greatest masters, and Xenophon and Plato are often seen to\nstoop to this low and popular manner of speaking and treating of things,\nbut supporting it with graces which never fail them.\n\nFarther, my language has nothing in it that is facile and polished; \u2018tis\nrough, free, and irregular, and as such pleases, if not my judgment, at\nall events my inclination, but I very well perceive that I sometimes give\nmyself too much rein, and that by endeavouring to avoid art and\naffectation I fall into the other inconvenience:\n\n                        \u201cBrevis esse laboro,\n                         Obscurus fio.\u201d\n\n          [ Endeavouring to be brief, I become obscure.\u201d\n           --Hor., Art. Poet., 25.]\n\nPlato says, that the long or the short are not properties, that either\ntake away or give value to language.  Should I attempt to follow the\nother more moderate, united, and regular style, I should never attain to\nit; and though the short round periods of Sallust best suit with my\nhumour, yet I find Caesar much grander and harder to imitate; and though\nmy inclination would rather prompt me to imitate Seneca\u2019s way of writing,\nyet I do nevertheless more esteem that of Plutarch.  Both in doing and\nspeaking I simply follow my own natural way; whence, peradventure, it\nfalls out that I am better at speaking than writing.  Motion and action\nanimate words, especially in those who lay about them briskly, as I do,\nand grow hot.  The comportment, the countenance; the voice, the robe, the\nplace, will set off some things that of themselves would appear no better\nthan prating.  Messalla complains in Tacitus of the straitness of some\ngarments in his time, and of the fashion of the benches where the orators\nwere to declaim, that were a disadvantage to their eloquence.\n\nMy French tongue is corrupted, both in the pronunciation and otherwise,\nby the barbarism of my country.  I never saw a man who was a native of\nany of the provinces on this side of the kingdom who had not a twang of\nhis place of birth, and that was not offensive to ears that were purely\nFrench.  And yet it is not that I am so perfect in my Perigordin: for I\ncan no more speak it than High Dutch, nor do I much care.  \u2018Tis a\nlanguage (as the rest about me on every side, of Poitou, Xaintonge,\nAngoumousin, Limousin, Auvergne), a poor, drawling, scurvy language.\nThere is, indeed, above us towards the mountains a sort of Gascon spoken,\nthat I am mightily taken with: blunt, brief, significant, and in truth a\nmore manly and military language than any other I am acquainted with, as\nsinewy, powerful, and pertinent as the French is graceful, neat, and\nluxuriant.\n\nAs to the Latin, which was given me for my mother tongue, I have by\ndiscontinuance lost the use of speaking it, and, indeed, of writing it\ntoo, wherein I formerly had a particular reputation, by which you may see\nhow inconsiderable I am on that side.\n\nBeauty is a thing of great recommendation in the correspondence amongst\nmen; \u2018tis the first means of acquiring the favour and good liking of one\nanother, and no man is so barbarous and morose as not to perceive himself\nin some sort struck with its attraction.  The body has a great share in\nour being, has an eminent place there, and therefore its structure and\ncomposition are of very just consideration.  They who go about to\ndisunite and separate our two principal parts from one another are to\nblame; we must, on the contrary, reunite and rejoin them.  We must\ncommand the soul not to withdraw and entertain itself apart, not to\ndespise and abandon the body (neither can she do it but by some apish\ncounterfeit), but to unite herself close to it, to embrace, cherish,\nassist, govern, and advise it, and to bring it back and set it into the\ntrue way when it wanders; in sum, to espouse and be a husband to it, so\nthat their effects may not appear to be diverse and contrary, but uniform\nand concurring.  Christians have a particular instruction concerning this\nconnection, for they know that the Divine justice embraces this society\nand juncture of body and soul, even to the making the body capable of\neternal rewards; and that God has an eye to the whole man\u2019s ways, and\nwills that he receive entire chastisement or reward according to his\ndemerits or merits.  The sect of the Peripatetics, of all sects the most\nsociable, attribute to wisdom this sole care equally to provide for the\ngood of these two associate parts: and the other sects, in not\nsufficiently applying themselves to the consideration of this mixture,\nshow themselves to be divided, one for the body and the other for the\nsoul, with equal error, and to have lost sight of their subject, which is\nMan, and their guide, which they generally confess to be Nature.  The\nfirst distinction that ever was amongst men, and the first consideration\nthat gave some pre-eminence over others, \u2018tis likely was the advantage of\nbeauty:\n\n              \u201cAgros divisere atque dedere\n               Pro facie cujusque, et viribus ingenioque;\n               Nam facies multum valuit, viresque vigebant.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThey distributed and conferred the lands to every man according\n     to his beauty and strength and understanding, for beauty was much\n     esteemed and strength was in favour.\u201d--Lucretius, V. 1109.]\n\nNow I am of something lower than the middle stature, a defect that not\nonly borders upon deformity, but carries withal a great deal of\ninconvenience along with it, especially for those who are in office and\ncommand; for the authority which a graceful presence and a majestic mien\nbeget is wanting.  C. Marius did not willingly enlist any soldiers who\nwere not six feet high.  The Courtier has, indeed, reason to desire a\nmoderate stature in the gentlemen he is setting forth, rather than any\nother, and to reject all strangeness that should make him be pointed at.\nBut if I were to choose whether this medium must be rather below than\nabove the common standard, I would not have it so in a soldier.  Little\nmen, says Aristotle, are pretty, but not handsome; and greatness of soul\nis discovered in a great body, as beauty is in a conspicuous stature: the\nEthiopians and Indians, says he, in choosing their kings and magistrates,\nhad regard to the beauty and stature of their persons.  They had reason;\nfor it creates respect in those who follow them, and is a terror to the\nenemy, to see a leader of a brave and goodly stature march at the head of\na battalion:\n\n         \u201cIpse inter primos praestanti corpore Turnus\n          Vertitur arma, tenens, et toto vertice supra est.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cIn the first rank marches Turnus, brandishing his weapon,\n     taller by a head than all the rest.\u201d--Virgil, AEneid, vii. 783.]\n\nOur holy and heavenly king, of whom every circumstance is most carefully\nand with the greatest religion and reverence to be observed, has not\nhimself rejected bodily recommendation,\n\n\n               \u201cSpeciosus forma prae filiis hominum.\u201d\n\n          [\u201cHe is fairer than the children of men.\u201d--Psalm xiv. 3.]\n\nAnd Plato, together with temperance and fortitude, requires beauty in the\nconservators of his republic.  It would vex you that a man should apply\nhimself to you amongst your servants to inquire where Monsieur is, and\nthat you should only have the remainder of the compliment of the hat that\nis made to your barber or your secretary; as it happened to poor\nPhilopoemen, who arriving the first of all his company at an inn where he\nwas expected, the hostess, who knew him not, and saw him an unsightly\nfellow, employed him to go help her maids a little to draw water, and\nmake a fire against Philopoemen\u2019s coming; the gentlemen of his train\narriving presently after, and surprised to see him busy in this fine\nemployment, for he failed not to obey his landlady\u2019s command, asked him\nwhat he was doing there: \u201cI am,\u201d said he, \u201cpaying the penalty of my\nugliness.\u201d  The other beauties belong to women; the beauty of stature is\nthe only beauty of men.  Where there is a contemptible stature, neither\nthe largeness and roundness of the forehead, nor the whiteness and\nsweetness of the eyes, nor the moderate proportion of the nose, nor the\nlittleness of the ears and mouth, nor the evenness and whiteness of the\nteeth, nor the thickness of a well-set brown beard, shining like the husk\nof a chestnut, nor curled hair, nor the just proportion of the head, nor\na fresh complexion, nor a pleasing air of a face, nor a body without any\noffensive scent, nor the just proportion of limbs, can make a handsome\nman.  I am, as to the rest, strong and well knit; my face is not puffed,\nbut full, and my complexion betwixt jovial and melancholic, moderately\nsanguine and hot,\n\n          \u201cUnde rigent setis mihi crura, et pectora villis;\u201d\n\n          [\u201cWhence \u2018tis my legs and breast bristle with hair.\u201d\n           --Martial, ii. 36, 5.]\n\nmy health vigorous and sprightly, even to a well advanced age, and rarely\ntroubled with sickness.  Such I was, for I do not now make any account of\nmyself, now that I am engaged in the avenues of old age, being already\npast forty:\n\n              \u201cMinutatim vires et robur adultum\n               Frangit, et in partem pejorem liquitur aetas:\u201d\n\n     [\u201cTime by degrees breaks our strength and makes us grow feeble.\n     --\u201cLucretius, ii.  1131.]\n\nwhat shall be from this time forward, will be but a half-being, and no\nmore me: I every day escape and steal away from myself:\n\n               \u201cSingula de nobis anni praedantur euntes.\u201d\n\n          [\u201cOf the fleeting years each steals something from me.\u201d\n           --Horace, Ep., ii. 2.]\n\nAgility and address I never had, and yet am the son of a very active and\nsprightly father, who continued to be so to an extreme old age.  I have\nscarce known any man of his condition, his equal in all bodily exercises,\nas I have seldom met with any who have not excelled me, except in\nrunning, at which I was pretty good.  In music or singing, for which I\nhave a very unfit voice, or to play on any sort of instrument, they could\nnever teach me anything.  In dancing, tennis, or wrestling, I could never\narrive to more than an ordinary pitch; in swimming, fencing, vaulting,\nand leaping, to none at all.  My hands are so clumsy that I cannot even\nwrite so as to read it myself, so that I had rather do what I have\nscribbled over again, than take upon me the trouble to make it out.  I do\nnot read much better than I write, and feel that I weary my auditors\notherwise (I am) not a bad clerk.  I cannot decently fold up a letter,\nnor could ever make a pen, or carve at table worth a pin, nor saddle a\nhorse, nor carry a hawk and fly her, nor hunt the dogs, nor lure a hawk,\nnor speak to a horse.  In fine, my bodily qualities are very well suited\nto those of my soul; there is nothing sprightly, only a full and firm\nvigour: I am patient enough of labour and pains, but it is only when I go\nvoluntary to work, and only so long as my own desire prompts me to it:\n\n          \u201cMolliter austerum studio fallente laborem.\u201d\n\n          [\u201cStudy softly beguiling severe labour.\u201d\n           --Horace, Sat., ii. 2, 12.]\n\notherwise, if I am not allured with some pleasure, or have other guide\nthan my own pure and free inclination, I am good for nothing: for I am of\na humour that, life and health excepted, there is nothing for which I\nwill bite my nails, and that I will purchase at the price of torment of\nmind and constraint:\n\n                         \u201cTanti mihi non sit opaci\n          Omnis arena Tagi, quodque in mare volvitur aurum.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cI would not buy rich Tagus sands so dear, nor all the gold that\n     lies in the sea.\u201d--Juvenal, Sat., iii. 54.]\n\nExtremely idle, extremely given up to my own inclination both by nature\nand art, I would as willingly lend a man my blood as my pains.  I have a\nsoul free and entirely its own, and accustomed to guide itself after its\nown fashion; having hitherto never had either master or governor imposed\nupon me: I have walked as far as I would, and at the pace that best\npleased myself; this is it that has rendered me unfit for the service of\nothers, and has made me of no use to any one but myself.\n\nNor was there any need of forcing my heavy and lazy disposition; for\nbeing born to such a fortune as I had reason to be contented with (a\nreason, nevertheless, that a thousand others of my acquaintance would\nhave rather made use of for a plank upon which to pass over in search of\nhigher fortune, to tumult and disquiet), and with as much intelligence as\nI required, I sought for no more, and also got no more:\n\n              \u201cNon agimur tumidis velis Aquilone secundo,\n               Non tamen adversis aetatem ducimus Austris\n               Viribus, ingenio, specie, virtute, loco, re,\n               Extremi primorum, extremis usque priores.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThe northern wind does not agitate our sails; nor Auster trouble\n     our course with storms.  In strength, talent, figure, virtue,\n     honour, wealth, we are short of the foremost, but before the last.\u201d\n      --Horace, Ep., ii. 2, 201.]\n\nI had only need of what was sufficient to content me: which nevertheless\nis a government of soul, to take it right, equally difficult in all sorts\nof conditions, and that, of custom, we see more easily found in want than\nin abundance: forasmuch, peradventure, as according to the course of our\nother passions, the desire of riches is more sharpened by their use than\nby the need of them: and the virtue of moderation more rare than that of\npatience; and I never had anything to desire, but happily to enjoy the\nestate that God by His bounty had put into my hands.  I have never known\nanything of trouble, and have had little to do in anything but the\nmanagement of my own affairs: or, if I have, it has been upon condition\nto do it at my own leisure and after my own method; committed to my trust\nby such as had a confidence in me, who did not importune me, and who knew\nmy humour; for good horsemen will make shift to get service out of a\nrusty and broken-winded jade.\n\nEven my infancy was trained up after a gentle and free manner, and exempt\nfrom any rigorous subjection.  All this has helped me to a complexion\ndelicate and incapable of solicitude, even to that degree that I love to\nhave my losses and the disorders wherein I am concerned, concealed from\nme.  In the account of my expenses, I put down what my negligence costs\nme in feeding and maintaining it;\n\n                              \u201cHaec nempe supersunt,\n               Quae dominum fallunt, quae prosunt furibus.\u201d\n\n               [\u201cThat overplus, which the owner knows not of,\n               but which benefits the thieves\u201d--Horace, Ep., i. 645]\n\nI love not to know what I have, that I may be less sensible of my loss;\nI entreat those who serve me, where affection and integrity are absent,\nto deceive me with something like a decent appearance.  For want of\nconstancy enough to support the shock of adverse accidents to which we\nare subject, and of patience seriously to apply myself to the management\nof my affairs, I nourish as much as I can this in myself, wholly leaving\nall to fortune \u201cto take all things at the worst, and to resolve to bear\nthat worst with temper and patience\u201d; that is the only thing I aim at,\nand to which I apply my whole meditation.  In a danger, I do not so much\nconsider how I shall escape it, as of how little importance it is,\nwhether I escape it or no: should I be left dead upon the place, what\nmatter?  Not being able to govern events, I govern myself, and apply\nmyself to them, if they will not apply themselves to me.  I have no great\nart to evade, escape from or force fortune, and by prudence to guide and\nincline things to my own bias.  I have still less patience to undergo the\ntroublesome and painful care therein required; and the most uneasy\ncondition for me is to be suspended on urgent occasions, and to be\nagitated betwixt hope and fear.\n\nDeliberation, even in things of lightest moment, is very troublesome to\nme; and I find my mind more put to it to undergo the various tumblings\nand tossings of doubt and consultation, than to set up its rest and to\nacquiesce in whatever shall happen after the die is thrown.  Few passions\nbreak my sleep, but of deliberations, the least will do it.  As in roads,\nI preferably avoid those that are sloping and slippery, and put myself\ninto the beaten track how dirty or deep soever, where I can fall no\nlower, and there seek my safety: so I love misfortunes that are purely\nso, that do not torment and tease me with the uncertainty of their\ngrowing better; but that at the first push plunge me directly into the\nworst that can be expected\n\n                    \u201cDubia plus torquent mala.\u201d\n\n               [\u201cDoubtful ills plague us worst.\u201d\n                --Seneca, Agamemnon, iii. 1, 29.]\n\n\nIn events I carry myself like a man; in conduct, like a child.  The fear\nof the fall more fevers me than the fall itself.  The game is not worth\nthe candle.  The covetous man fares worse with his passion than the poor,\nand the jealous man than the cuckold; and a man ofttimes loses more by\ndefending his vineyard than if he gave it up.  The lowest walk is the\nsafest; \u2018tis the seat of constancy; you have there need of no one but\nyourself; \u2018tis there founded and wholly stands upon its own basis.  Has\nnot this example of a gentleman very well known, some air of philosophy\nin it?  He married, being well advanced in years, having spent his youth\nin good fellowship, a great talker and a great jeerer, calling to mind\nhow much the subject of cuckoldry had given him occasion to talk and\nscoff at others.  To prevent them from paying him in his own coin, he\nmarried a wife from a place where any one finds what he wants for his\nmoney: \u201cGood morrow, strumpet\u201d; \u201cGood morrow, cuckold\u201d; and there was not\nanything wherewith he more commonly and openly entertained those who came\nto see him than with this design of his, by which he stopped the private\nchattering of mockers, and blunted all the point from this reproach.\n\nAs to ambition, which is neighbour, or rather daughter, to presumption,\nfortune, to advance me, must have come and taken me by the hand; for to\ntrouble myself for an uncertain hope, and to have submitted myself to all\nthe difficulties that accompany those who endeavour to bring themselves\ninto credit in the beginning of their progress, I could never have done\nit:\n\n                         \u201cSpem pretio non emo.\u201d\n\n               [\u201cI will not purchase hope with ready money,\u201d (or),\n               \u201cI do not purchase hope at a price.\u201d\n                --Terence, Adelphi, ii. 3, 11.]\n\nI apply myself to what I see and to what I have in my hand, and go not\nvery far from the shore,\n\n               \u201cAlter remus aquas, alter tibi radat arenas:\u201d\n\n     [\u201cOne oar plunging into the sea, the other raking the sands.\u201d\n      --Propertius, iii.  3, 23.]\n\nand besides, a man rarely arrives at these advancements but in first\nhazarding what he has of his own; and I am of opinion that if a man have\nsufficient to maintain him in the condition wherein he was born and\nbrought up, \u2018tis a great folly to hazard that upon the uncertainty of\naugmenting it.  He to whom fortune has denied whereon to set his foot,\nand to settle a quiet and composed way of living, is to be excused if he\nventure what he has, because, happen what will, necessity puts him upon\nshifting for himself:\n\n               \u201cCapienda rebus in malis praeceps via est:\u201d\n\n          [\u201cA course is to be taken in bad cases.\u201d (or),\n          \u201cA desperate case must have a desperate course.\u201d\n           ---Seneca, Agamemnon, ii. 1, 47.]\n\nand I rather excuse a younger brother for exposing what his friends have\nleft him to the courtesy of fortune, than him with whom the honour of his\nfamily is entrusted, who cannot be necessitous but by his own fault.\nI have found a much shorter and more easy way, by the advice of the good\nfriends I had in my younger days, to free myself from any such ambition,\nand to sit still:\n\n          \u201cCui sit conditio dulcis sine pulvere palmae:\u201d\n\n     [\u201cWhat condition can compare with that where one has gained the\n     palm without the dust of the course.\u201d--Horace,  Ep., i. I, 51.]\n\njudging rightly enough of my own strength, that it was not capable of any\ngreat matters; and calling to mind the saying of the late Chancellor\nOlivier, that the French were like monkeys that swarm up a tree from\nbranch to branch, and never stop till they come to the highest, and there\nshew their breech.\n\n          \u201cTurpe est, quod nequeas, capiti committere pondus,\n          Et pressum inflexo mox dare terga genu.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cIt is a shame to load the head so that it cannot bear the\n     burthen, and the knees give way.\u201d--Propertius, iii. 9, 5.]\n\nI should find the best qualities I have useless in this age; the facility\nof my manners would have been called weakness and negligence; my faith\nand conscience, scrupulosity and superstition; my liberty and freedom\nwould have been reputed troublesome, inconsiderate, and rash.  Ill luck\nis good for something.  It is good to be born in a very depraved age; for\nso, in comparison of others, you shall be reputed virtuous good cheap; he\nwho in our days is but a parricide and a sacrilegious person is an honest\nman and a man of honour:\n\n              \u201cNunc, si depositum non inficiatur amicus,\n               Si reddat veterem cum tota aerugine follem,\n               Prodigiosa fides, et Tuscis digna libellis,\n               Quaeque coronata lustrari debeat agna:\u201d\n\n     [\u201cNow, if a friend does not deny his trust, but restores the old\n     purse with all its rust; \u2018tis a prodigious faith, worthy to be\n     enrolled in amongst the Tuscan annals, and a crowned lamb should be\n     sacrificed to such exemplary integrity.\u201d--Juvenal, Sat., xiii. 611.]\n\nand never was time or place wherein princes might propose to themselves\nmore assured or greater rewards for virtue and justice.  The first who\nshall make it his business to get himself into favour and esteem by those\nways, I am much deceived if he do not and by the best title outstrip his\ncompetitors: force and violence can do something, but not always all.\nWe see merchants, country justices, and artisans go cheek by jowl with\nthe best gentry in valour and military knowledge: they perform honourable\nactions, both in public engagements and private quarrels; they fight\nduels, they defend towns in our present wars; a prince stifles his\nspecial recommendation, renown, in this crowd; let him shine bright in\nhumanity, truth, loyalty, temperance, and especially injustice; marks\nrare, unknown, and exiled; \u2018tis by no other means but by the sole\ngoodwill of the people that he can do his business; and no other\nqualities can attract their goodwill like those, as being of the greatest\nutility to them:\n\n               \u201cNil est tam populare, quam bonitas.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cNothing is so popular as an agreeable manner (goodness).\u201d\n      --Cicero, Pro Ligar., c. 12.]\n\nBy this standard I had been great and rare, just as I find myself now\npigmy and vulgar by the standard of some past ages, wherein, if no other\nbetter qualities concurred, it was ordinary and common to see a man\nmoderate in his revenges, gentle in resenting injuries, religious of his\nword, neither double nor supple, nor accommodating his faith to the will\nof others, or the turns of the times: I would rather see all affairs go\nto wreck and ruin than falsify my faith to secure them.  For as to this\nnew virtue of feigning and dissimulation, which is now in so great\ncredit, I mortally hate it; and of all vices find none that evidences so\nmuch baseness and meanness of spirit.  \u2018Tis a cowardly and servile humour\nto hide and disguise a man\u2019s self under a visor, and not to dare to show\nhimself what he is; \u2018tis by this our servants are trained up to\ntreachery; being brought up to speak what is not true, they make no\nconscience of a lie.  A generous heart ought not to belie its own\nthoughts; it will make itself seen within; all there is good, or at least\nhuman.  Aristotle  reputes it the office of magnanimity openly and\nprofessedly to love and hate; to judge and speak with all freedom; and\nnot to value the approbation or dislike of others in comparison of truth.\nApollonius said it was for slaves to lie, and for freemen to speak truth:\n\u2018tis the chief and fundamental part of virtue; we must love it for\nitself.  He who speaks truth because he is obliged so to do, and because\nit serves him, and who is not afraid to lie when it signifies nothing to\nanybody, is not sufficiently true.  My soul naturally abominates lying,\nand hates the very thought of it.  I have an inward shame and a sharp\nremorse, if sometimes a lie escapes me: as sometimes it does, being\nsurprised by occasions that allow me no premeditation.  A man must not\nalways tell all, for that were folly: but what a man says should be what\nhe thinks, otherwise \u2018tis knavery.  I do not know what advantage men\npretend to by eternally counterfeiting and dissembling, if not never to\nbe believed when they speak the truth; it may once or twice pass with\nmen; but to profess the concealing their thought, and to brag, as some of\nour princes have done, that they would burn their shirts if they knew\ntheir true intentions, which was a saying of the ancient Metellius of\nMacedon; and that they who know not how to dissemble know not how to\nrule, is to give warning to all who have anything to do with them, that\nall they say is nothing but lying and deceit:\n\n          \u201cQuo quis versutior et callidior est, hoc invisior et\n          suspectior, detracto opinione probitatis:\u201d\n\n     [\u201cBy how much any one is more subtle and cunning, by so much is he\n     hated and suspected, the opinion of his integrity being withdrawn.\u201d\n      --Cicero, De Off., ii. 9.]\n\nit were a great simplicity in any one to lay any stress either on the\ncountenance or word of a man who has put on a resolution to be always\nanother thing without than he is within, as Tiberius did; and I cannot\nconceive what part such persons can have in conversation with men, seeing\nthey produce nothing that is received as true: whoever is disloyal to\ntruth is the same to falsehood also.\n\nThose of our time who have considered in the establishment of the duty of\na prince the good of his affairs only, and have preferred that to the\ncare of his faith and conscience, might have something to say to a prince\nwhose affairs fortune had put into such a posture that he might for ever\nestablish them by only once breaking his word: but it will not go so;\nthey often buy in the same market; they make more than one peace and\nenter into more than one treaty in their lives.  Gain tempts to the first\nbreach of faith, and almost always presents itself, as in all other ill\nacts, sacrileges, murders, rebellions, treasons, as being undertaken for\nsome kind of advantage; but this first gain has infinite mischievous\nconsequences, throwing this prince out of all correspondence and\nnegotiation, by this example of infidelity.  Soliman, of the Ottoman\nrace, a race not very solicitous of keeping their words or compacts,\nwhen, in my infancy, he made his army land at Otranto, being informed\nthat Mercurino de\u2019 Gratinare and the inhabitants of Castro were detained\nprisoners, after having surrendered the place, contrary to the articles\nof their capitulation, sent orders to have them set at liberty, saying,\nthat having other great enterprises in hand in those parts, the\ndisloyalty, though it carried a show of present utility, would for the\nfuture bring on him a disrepute and distrust of infinite prejudice.\n\nNow, for my part, I had rather be troublesome and indiscreet than a\nflatterer and a dissembler.  I confess that there may be some mixture of\npride and obstinacy in keeping myself so upright and open as I do,\nwithout any consideration of others; and methinks I am a little too free,\nwhere I ought least to be so, and that I grow hot by the opposition of\nrespect; and it may be also, that I suffer myself to follow the\npropension of my own nature for want of art; using the same liberty,\nspeech, and countenance towards great persons, that I bring with me from\nmy own house: I am sensible how much it declines towards incivility and\nindiscretion but, besides that I am so bred, I have not a wit supple\nenough to evade a sudden question, and to escape by some evasion, nor to\nfeign a truth, nor memory enough to retain it so feigned; nor, truly,\nassurance enough to maintain it, and so play the brave out of weakness.\nAnd therefore it is that I abandon myself to candour, always to speak as\nI think, both by complexion and design, leaving the event to fortune.\nAristippus was wont to say, that the principal benefit he had extracted\nfrom philosophy was that he spoke freely and openly to all.\n\nMemory is a faculty of wonderful use, and without which the judgment can\nvery hardly perform its office: for my part I have none at all.  What any\none will propound to me, he must do it piecemeal, for to answer a speech\nconsisting of several heads I am not able.  I could not receive a\ncommission by word of mouth without a note-book.  And when I have a\nspeech of consequence to make, if it be long, I am reduced to the\nmiserable necessity of getting by heart word for word, what I am to say;\nI should otherwise have neither method nor assurance, being in fear that\nmy memory would play me a slippery trick.  But this way is no less\ndifficult to me than the other; I must have three hours to learn three\nverses.  And besides, in a work of a man\u2019s own, the liberty and authority\nof altering the order, of changing a word, incessantly varying the\nmatter, makes it harder to stick in the memory of the author.  The more\nI mistrust it the worse it is; it serves me best by chance; I must\nsolicit it negligently; for if I press it, \u2018tis confused, and after it\nonce begins to stagger, the more I sound it, the more it is perplexed;\nit serves me at its own hour, not at mine.\n\nAnd the same defect I find in my memory, I find also in several other\nparts.  I fly command, obligation, and constraint; that which I can\notherwise naturally and easily do, if I impose it upon myself by an\nexpress and strict injunction, I cannot do it.  Even the members of my\nbody, which have a more particular jurisdiction of their own, sometimes\nrefuse to obey me, if I enjoin them a necessary service at a certain\nhour.  This tyrannical and compulsive appointment baffles them; they\nshrink up either through fear or spite, and fall into a trance.  Being\nonce in a place where it is looked upon as barbarous discourtesy not to\npledge those who drink to you, though I had there all liberty allowed me,\nI tried to play the good fellow, out of respect to the ladies who were\nthere, according to the custom of the country; but there was sport enough\nfor this pressure and preparation, to force myself contrary to my custom\nand inclination, so stopped my throat that I could not swallow one drop,\nand was deprived of drinking so much as with my meat; I found myself\ngorged, and my, thirst quenched by the quantity of drink that my\nimagination had swallowed.  This effect is most manifest in such as have\nthe most vehement and powerful imagination: but it is natural,\nnotwithstanding, and there is no one who does not in some measure feel\nit.  They offered an excellent archer, condemned to die, to save his\nlife, if he would show some notable proof of his art, but he refused to\ntry, fearing lest the too great contention of his will should make him\nshoot wide, and that instead of saving his life, he should also lose the\nreputation he had got of being a good marksman.  A man who thinks of\nsomething else, will not fail to take over and over again the same number\nand measure of steps, even to an inch, in the place where he walks; but\nif he made it his business to measure and count them, he will find that\nwhat he did by nature and accident, he cannot so exactly do by design.\n\nMy library, which is a fine one among those of the village type, is\nsituated in a corner of my house; if anything comes into my head that I\nhave a mind to search or to write, lest I should forget it in but going\nacross the court, I am fain to commit it to the memory of some other.\nIf I venture in speaking to digress never so little from my subject, I am\ninfallibly lost, which is the reason that I keep myself, in discourse,\nstrictly close.  I am forced to call the men who serve me either by the\nnames of their offices or their country; for names are very hard for me\nto remember.  I can tell indeed that there are three syllables, that it\nhas a harsh sound, and that it begins or ends with such a letter; but\nthat\u2019s all; and if I should live long, I do not doubt but I should forget\nmy own name, as some others have done.  Messala Corvinus was two years\nwithout any trace of memory, which is also said of Georgius Trapezuntius.\nFor my own interest, I often meditate what a kind of life theirs was, and\nif, without this faculty, I should have enough left to support me with\nany manner of ease; and prying narrowly into it, I fear that this\nprivation, if absolute, destroys all the other functions of the soul:\n\n          \u201cPlenus rimarum sum, hac atque iliac perfluo.\u201d\n\n          [\u201cI\u2019m full of chinks, and leak out every way.\u201d\n           --Ter., Eunuchus, ii. 2, 23.]\n\nIt has befallen me more than once to forget the watchword I had three\nhours before given or received, and to forget where I had hidden my\npurse; whatever Cicero is pleased to say, I help myself to lose what I\nhave a particular care to lock safe up:\n\n          \u201cMemoria certe non modo Philosophiam sed omnis\n          vitae usum, omnesque artes, una maxime continet.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cIt is certain that memory contains not only philosophy,\n     but all the arts and all that appertain to the use of life.\u201d\n      --Cicero, Acad., ii. 7.]\n\nMemory is the receptacle and case of science: and therefore mine being so\ntreacherous, if I know little, I cannot much complain.  I know, in\ngeneral, the names of the arts, and of what they treat, but nothing more.\nI turn over books; I do not study them.  What I retain I no longer\nrecognise as another\u2019s; \u2018tis only what my judgment has made its advantage\nof, the discourses and imaginations in which it has been instructed: the\nauthor, place, words, and other circumstances, I immediately forget; and\nI am so excellent at forgetting, that I no less forget my own writings\nand compositions than the rest.  I am very often quoted to myself, and am\nnot aware of it.  Whoever should inquire of me where I had the verses and\nexamples, that I have here huddled together, would puzzle me to tell him,\nand yet I have not borrowed them but from famous and known authors, not\ncontenting myself that they were rich, if I, moreover, had them not from\nrich and honourable hands, where there is a concurrence of authority with\nreason.  It is no great wonder if my book run the same fortune that other\nbooks do, if my memory lose what I have written as well as what I have\nread, and what I give, as well as what I receive.\n\nBesides the defect of memory, I have others which very much contribute to\nmy ignorance; I have a slow and heavy wit, the least cloud stops its\nprogress, so that, for example, I never propose to it any never so easy a\nriddle that it could find out; there is not the least idle subtlety that\nwill not gravel me; in games, where wit is required, as chess, draughts,\nand the like, I understand no more than the common movements.  I have a\nslow and perplexed apprehension, but what it once apprehends, it\napprehends well, for the time it retains it.  My sight is perfect,\nentire, and discovers at a very great distance, but is soon weary and\nheavy at work, which occasions that I cannot read long, but am forced to\nhave one to read to me.  The younger Pliny  can inform such as have not\nexperimented it themselves, how important an impediment this is to those\nwho devote themselves to this employment.\n\nThere is no so wretched and coarse a soul, wherein some particular\nfaculty is not seen to shine; no soul so buried in sloth and ignorance,\nbut it will sally at one end or another; and how it comes to pass that a\nman blind and asleep to everything else, shall be found sprightly, clear,\nand excellent in some one particular effect, we are to inquire of our\nmasters: but the beautiful souls are they that are universal, open, and\nready for all things; if not instructed, at least capable of being so;\nwhich I say to accuse my own; for whether it be through infirmity or\nnegligence (and to neglect that which lies at our feet, which we have in\nour hands, and what nearest concerns the use of life, is far from my\ndoctrine) there is not a soul in the world so awkward as mine, and so\nignorant of many common things, and such as a man cannot without shame\nfail to know.  I must give some examples.\n\nI was born and bred up in the country, and amongst husbandmen; I have had\nbusiness and husbandry in my own hands ever since my predecessors, who\nwere lords of the estate I now enjoy, left me to succeed them; and yet I\ncan neither cast accounts, nor reckon my counters: most of our current\nmoney I do not know, nor the difference betwixt one grain and another,\neither growing or in the barn, if it be not too apparent, and scarcely\ncan distinguish between the cabbage and lettuce in my garden.  I do not\nso much as understand the names of the chief instruments of husbandry,\nnor the most ordinary elements of agriculture, which the very children\nknow: much less the mechanic arts, traffic, merchandise, the variety and\nnature of fruits, wines, and viands, nor how to make a hawk fly, nor to\nphysic a horse or a dog.  And, since I must publish my whole shame, \u2018tis\nnot above a month ago, that I was trapped in my ignorance of the use of\nleaven to make bread, or to what end it was to keep wine in the vat.\nThey conjectured of old at Athens,  an aptitude for the mathematics in\nhim they saw ingeniously bavin up a burthen of brushwood.  In earnest,\nthey would draw a quite contrary conclusion from me, for give me the\nwhole provision and necessaries of a kitchen, I should starve.  By these\nfeatures of my confession men may imagine others to my prejudice: but\nwhatever I deliver myself to be, provided it be such as I really am,\nI have my end; neither will I make any excuse for committing to paper\nsuch mean and frivolous things as these: the meanness of the subject\ncompells me to it.  They may, if they please, accuse my project, but not\nmy progress: so it is, that without anybody\u2019s needing to tell me, I\nsufficiently see of how little weight and value all this is, and the\nfolly of my design: \u2018tis enough that my judgment does not contradict\nitself, of which these are the essays.\n\n              \u201cNasutus sis usque licet, sis denique nasus,\n               Quantum noluerit ferre rogatus Atlas;\n               Et possis ipsum to deridere Latinum,\n               Non potes in nugas dicere plura mess,\n               Ipse ego quam dixi: quid dentem dente juvabit\n               Rodere?  carne opus est, si satur esse velis.\n               Ne perdas operam; qui se mirantur, in illos\n               Virus habe; nos haec novimus esse nihil.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cLet your nose be as keen as it will, be all nose, and even a nose\n     so great that Atlas will refuse to bear it: if asked, Could you even\n     excel Latinus in scoffing; against my trifles you could say no more\n     than I myself have said: then to what end contend tooth against\n     tooth?  You must have flesh, if you want to be full; lose not your\n     labour then; cast your venom upon those that admire themselves; I\n     know already that these things are worthless.\u201d--Mart., xiii. 2.]\n\nI am not obliged not to utter absurdities, provided I am not deceived in\nthem and know them to be such: and to trip knowingly, is so ordinary with\nme, that I seldom do it otherwise, and rarely trip by chance.  \u2018Tis no\ngreat matter to add ridiculous actions to the temerity of my humour,\nsince I cannot ordinarily help supplying it with those that are vicious.\n\nI was present one day at Barleduc,  when King Francis II., for a memorial\nof Rene, king of Sicily, was presented with a portrait he had drawn of\nhimself: why is it not in like manner lawful for every one to draw\nhimself with a pen, as he did with a crayon?  I will not, therefore, omit\nthis blemish though very unfit to be published, which is irresolution; a\nvery great effect and very incommodious in the negotiations of the\naffairs of the world; in doubtful enterprises, I know not which to\nchoose:\n\n               \u201cNe si, ne no, nel cor mi suona intero.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cMy heart does not tell me either yes or no.\u201d--Petrarch.]\n\nI can maintain an opinion, but I cannot choose one.  By reason that in\nhuman things, to what sect soever we incline, many appearances present\nthemselves that confirm us in it; and the philosopher Chrysippus said,\nthat he would of Zeno and Cleanthes, his masters, learn their doctrines\nonly; for, as to proofs and reasons, he should find enough of his own.\nWhich way soever I turn, I still furnish myself with causes, and\nlikelihood enough to fix me there; which makes me detain doubt and the\nliberty of choosing, till occasion presses; and then, to confess the\ntruth, I, for the most part, throw the feather into the wind, as the\nsaying is, and commit myself to the mercy of fortune; a very light\ninclination and circumstance carries me along with it.\n\n         \u201cDum in dubio est animus, paulo momento huc atque\n          Illuc impellitur.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cWhile the mind is in doubt, in a short time it is impelled this\n     way and that.\u201d--Terence, Andr., i. 6, 32.]\n\nThe uncertainty of my judgment is so equally balanced in most\noccurrences, that I could willingly refer it to be decided by the chance\nof a die: and I observe, with great consideration of our human infirmity,\nthe examples that the divine history itself has left us of this custom of\nreferring to fortune and chance the determination of election in doubtful\nthings:\n\n                    \u201cSors cecidit super Matthiam.\u201d\n\n               [\u201cThe lot fell upon Matthew.\u201d--Acts i. 26.]\n\nHuman reason is a two-edged and dangerous sword: observe in the hands of\nSocrates, her most intimate and familiar friend, how many several points\nit has.  I am thus good for nothing but to follow and suffer myself to be\neasily carried away with the crowd; I have not confidence enough in my\nown strength to take upon me to command and lead; I am very glad to find\nthe way beaten before me by others.  If I must run the hazard of an\nuncertain choice, I am rather willing to have it under such a one as is\nmore confident in his opinions than I am in mine, whose ground and\nfoundation I find to be very slippery and unsure.\n\nYet I do not easily change, by reason that I discern the same weakness in\ncontrary opinions:\n\n               \u201cIpsa consuetudo assentiendi periculosa\n               esse videtur, et lubrica;\u201d\n\n          [\u201cThe very custom of assenting seems to be dangerous\n          and slippery.\u201d--Cicero, Acad., ii. 21.]\n\nespecially in political affairs, there is a large field open for changes\nand contestation:\n\n         \u201cJusta pari premitur veluti cum pondere libra,\n          Prona, nec hac plus pane sedet, nec surgit ab illa.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cAs a just balance, pressed with equal weight, neither dips\n     nor rises on either side.\u201d--Tibullus, iv. 41.]\n\nMachiavelli\u2019s writings, for example, were solid enough for the subject,\nyet were they easy enough to be controverted; and they who have done so,\nhave left as great a facility of controverting theirs; there was never\nwanting in that kind of argument replies and replies upon replies, and as\ninfinite a contexture of debates as our wrangling lawyers have extended\nin favour of long suits:\n\n          \u201cCaedimur et totidem plagis consumimus hostem;\u201d\n\n     [\u201cWe are slain, and with as many blows kill the enemy\u201d (or),\n     \u201cIt is a fight wherein we exhaust each other by mutual wounds.\u201d\n      --Horace, Epist., ii. 2, 97.]\n\nthe reasons have little other foundation than experience, and the variety\nof human events presenting us with infinite examples of all sorts of\nforms.  An understanding person of our times says: That whoever would, in\ncontradiction to our almanacs, write cold where they say hot, and wet\nwhere they say dry, and always put the contrary to what they foretell; if\nhe were to lay a wager, he would not care which side he took, excepting\nwhere no uncertainty could fall out, as to promise excessive heats at\nChristmas, or extremity of cold at Midsummer.  I have the same opinion of\nthese political controversies; be on which side you will, you have as\nfair a game to play as your adversary, provided you do not proceed so far\nas to shock principles that are broad and manifest.  And yet, in my\nconceit, in public affairs, there is no government so ill, provided it be\nancient and has been constant, that is not better than change and\nalteration.\n\nOur manners are infinitely corrupt, and wonderfully incline to the worse;\nof our laws and customs there are many that are barbarous and monstrous\nnevertheless, by reason of the difficulty of reformation, and the danger\nof stirring things, if I could put something under to stop the wheel, and\nkeep it where it is, I would do it with all my heart:\n\n              \u201cNumquam adeo foedis, adeoque pudendis\n               Utimur exemplis, ut non pejora supersint.\u201d\n\n          [\u201cThe examples we use are not so shameful and foul\n          but that worse remain behind.\u201d--Juvenal, viii. 183.]\n\nThe worst thing I find in our state is instability, and that our laws,\nno more than our clothes, cannot settle in any certain form.  It is very\neasy to accuse a government of imperfection, for all mortal things are\nfull of it: it is very easy to beget in a people a contempt of ancient\nobservances; never any man undertook it but he did it; but to establish a\nbetter regimen in the stead of that which a man has overthrown, many who\nhave attempted it have foundered.  I very little consult my prudence in\nmy conduct; I am willing to let it be guided by the public rule.  Happy\nthe people who do what they are commanded, better than they who command,\nwithout tormenting themselves as to the causes; who suffer themselves\ngently to roll after the celestial revolution!  Obedience is never pure\nnor calm in him who reasons and disputes.\n\nIn fine, to return to myself: the only thing by which I something esteem\nmyself, is that wherein never any man thought himself to be defective; my\nrecommendation is vulgar, common, and popular; for who ever thought he\nwanted sense?  It would be a proposition that would imply a contradiction\nin itself; \u2018tis a disease that never is where it is discerned; \u2018tis\ntenacious and strong, but what the first ray of the patient\u2019s sight\nnevertheless pierces through and disperses, as the beams of the sun do\nthick and obscure mists; to accuse one\u2019s self would be to excuse in this\ncase, and to condemn, to absolve.  There never was porter or the silliest\ngirl, that did not think they had sense enough to do their business.\nWe easily enough confess in others an advantage of courage, strength,\nexperience, activity, and beauty, but an advantage in judgment we yield\nto none; and the reasons that proceed simply from the natural conclusions\nof others, we think, if we had but turned our thoughts that way, we\nshould ourselves have found out as well as they.  Knowledge, style, and\nsuch parts as we see in others\u2019 works, we are soon aware of, if they\nexcel our own: but for the simple products of the understanding, every\none thinks he could have found out the like in himself, and is hardly\nsensible of the weight and difficulty, if not (and then with much ado) in\nan extreme and incomparable distance.  And whoever should be able clearly\nto discern the height of another\u2019s judgment, would be also able to raise\nhis own to the same pitch.  So that it is a sort of exercise, from which\na man is to expect very little praise; a kind of composition of small\nrepute.  And, besides, for whom do you write?  The learned, to whom the\nauthority appertains of judging books, know no other value but that of\nlearning, and allow of no other proceeding of wit but that of erudition\nand art: if you have mistaken one of the Scipios for another, what is all\nthe rest you have to say worth?  Whoever is ignorant of Aristotle,\naccording to their rule, is in some sort ignorant of himself; vulgar\nsouls cannot discern the grace and force of a lofty and delicate style.\nNow these two sorts of men take up the world.  The third sort into whose\nhands you fall, of souls that are regular and strong of themselves, is so\nrare, that it justly has neither name nor place amongst us; and \u2018tis so\nmuch time lost to aspire unto it, or to endeavour to please it.\n\n\u2018Tis commonly said that the justest portion Nature has given us of her\nfavours is that of sense; for there is no one who is not contented with\nhis share: is it not reason? whoever should see beyond that, would see\nbeyond his sight.  I think my opinions are good and sound, but who does\nnot think the same of his own?  One of the best proofs I have that mine\nare so is the small esteem I have of myself; for had they not been very\nwell assured, they would easily have suffered themselves to have been\ndeceived by the peculiar affection I have to myself, as one that places\nit almost wholly in myself, and do not let much run out.  All that others\ndistribute amongst an infinite number of friends and acquaintance, to\ntheir glory and grandeur, I dedicate to the repose of my own mind and to\nmyself; that which escapes thence is not properly by my direction:\n\n               \u201cMihi nempe valere et vivere doctus.\u201d\n\n               [\u201cTo live and to do well for myself.\u201d\n                --Lucretius, v. 959.]\n\nNow I find my opinions very bold and constant in condemning my own\nimperfection.  And, to say the truth, \u2018tis a subject upon which I\nexercise my judgment as much as upon any other.  The world looks always\nopposite; I turn my sight inwards, and there fix and employ it.  I have\nno other business but myself, I am eternally meditating upon myself,\nconsidering and tasting myself.  Other men\u2019s thoughts are ever wandering\nabroad, if they will but see it; they are still going forward:\n\n               \u201cNemo in sese tentat descendere;\u201d\n\n          [\u201cNo one thinks of descending into himself.\u201d\n           --Persius, iv. 23.]\n\nfor my part, I circulate in myself.  This capacity of trying the truth,\nwhatever it be, in myself, and this free humour of not over easily\nsubjecting my belief, I owe principally to myself; for the strongest and\nmost general imaginations I have are those that, as a man may say, were\nborn with me; they are natural and entirely my own.  I produced them\ncrude and simple, with a strong and bold production, but a little\ntroubled and imperfect; I have since established and fortified them with\nthe authority of others and the sound examples of the ancients, whom I\nhave found of the same judgment: they have given me faster hold, and a\nmore manifest fruition and possession of that I had before embraced.  The\nreputation that every one pretends to of vivacity and promptness of wit,\nI seek in regularity; the glory they pretend to from a striking and\nsignal action, or some particular excellence, I claim from order,\ncorrespondence, and tranquillity of opinions and manners:\n\n     \u201cOmnino si quidquam est decorum, nihil est profecto magis, quam\n     aequabilitas universae vitae, tum singularum actionum, quam\n     conservare non possis, si, aliorum naturam imitans, omittas tuam.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cIf anything be entirely decorous, nothing certainly can be more so\n     than an equability alike in the whole life and in every particular\n     action; which thou canst not possibly observe if, imitating other\n     men\u2019s natures, thou layest aside thy own.\u201d--Cicero, De Of., i. 31.]\n\nHere, then, you see to what degree I find myself guilty of this first\npart, that I said was the vice of presumption.  As to the second, which\nconsists in not having a sufficient esteem for others, I know not whether\nor no I can so well excuse myself; but whatever comes on\u2019t I am resolved\nto speak the truth.  And whether, peradventure, it be that the continual\nfrequentation I have had with the humours of the ancients, and the idea\nof those great souls of past ages, put me out of taste both with others\nand myself, or that, in truth, the age we live in produces but very\nindifferent things, yet so it is that I see nothing worthy of any great\nadmiration.  Neither, indeed, have I so great an intimacy with many men\nas is requisite to make a right judgment of them; and those with whom my\ncondition makes me the most frequent, are, for the most part, men who\nhave little care of the culture of the soul, but that look upon honour as\nthe sum of all blessings, and valour as the height of all perfection.\n\nWhat I see that is fine in others I very readily commend and esteem: nay,\nI often say more in their commendation than I think they really deserve,\nand give myself so far leave to lie, for I cannot invent a false subject:\nmy testimony is never wanting to my friends in what I conceive deserves\npraise, and where a foot is due I am willing to give them a foot and a\nhalf; but to attribute to them qualities that they have not, I cannot do\nit, nor openly defend their imperfections.  Nay, I frankly give my very\nenemies their due testimony of honour; my affection alters, my judgment\ndoes not, and I never confound my animosity with other circumstances that\nare foreign to it; and I am so jealous of the liberty of my judgment that\nI can very hardly part with it for any passion whatever.  I do myself a\ngreater injury in lying than I do him of whom I tell a lie.  This\ncommendable and generous custom is observed of the Persian nation, that\nthey spoke of their mortal enemies and with whom they were at deadly war,\nas honourably and justly as their virtues deserved.\n\nI know men enough that have several fine parts; one wit, another courage,\nanother address, another conscience, another language: one science,\nanother, another; but a generally great man, and who has all these brave\nparts together, or any one of them to such a degree of excellence that we\nshould admire him or compare him with those we honour of times past, my\nfortune never brought me acquainted with; and the greatest I ever knew, I\nmean for the natural parts of the soul, was Etienne De la Boetie; his was\na full soul indeed, and that had every way a beautiful aspect: a soul of\nthe old stamp, and that had produced great effects had his fortune been\nso pleased, having added much to those great natural parts by learning\nand study.\n\nBut how it comes to pass I know not, and yet it is certainly so, there is\nas much vanity and weakness of judgment in those who profess the greatest\nabilities, who take upon them learned callings and bookish employments as\nin any other sort of men whatever; either because more is required and\nexpected from them, and that common defects are excusable in them, or\nbecause the opinion they have of their own learning makes them more bold\nto expose and lay themselves too open, by which they lose and betray\nthemselves.  As an artificer more manifests his want of skill in a rich\nmatter he has in hand, if he disgrace the work by ill handling and\ncontrary to the rules required, than in a matter of less value; and men\nare more displeased at a disproportion in a statue of gold than in one of\nplaster; so do these when they advance things that in themselves and in\ntheir place would be good; for they make use of them without discretion,\nhonouring their memories at the expense of their understandings, and\nmaking themselves ridiculous by honouring Cicero, Galen, Ulpian, and St.\nJerome alike.\n\nI willingly fall again into the discourse of the vanity of our education,\nthe end of which is not to render us good and wise, but learned, and she\nhas obtained it.  She has not taught us to follow and embrace virtue and\nprudence, but she has imprinted in us their derivation and etymology; we\nknow how to decline Virtue, if we know not how to love it; if we do not\nknow what prudence is really and in effect, and by experience, we have it\nhowever by jargon and heart: we are not content to know the extraction,\nkindred, and alliances of our neighbours; we desire, moreover, to have\nthem our friends and to establish a correspondence and intelligence with\nthem; but this education of ours has taught us definitions, divisions,\nand partitions of virtue, as so many surnames and branches of a\ngenealogy, without any further care of establishing any familiarity or\nintimacy betwixt her and us.  It has culled out for our initiatory\ninstruction not such books as contain the soundest and truest opinions,\nbut those that speak the best Greek and Latin, and by their fine words\nhas instilled into our fancy the vainest humours of antiquity.\n\nA good education alters the judgment and manners; as it happened to\nPolemon, a lewd and debauched young Greek, who going by chance to hear\none of Xenocrates\u2019 lectures, did not only observe the eloquence and\nlearning of the reader, and not only brought away, the knowledge of some\nfine matter, but a more manifest and more solid profit, which was the\nsudden change and reformation of his former life.  Whoever found such an\neffect of our discipline?\n\n                              \u201cFaciasne, quod olim\n               Mutatus Polemon? ponas insignia morbi\n               Fasciolas, cubital, focalia; potus ut ille\n               Dicitur ex collo furtim carpsisse coronas,\n               Postquam est impransi correptus voce magistri?\u201d\n\n     [\u201cWill you do what reformed Polemon did of old? will you lay aside\n     the joys of your disease, your garters, capuchin, muffler, as he in\n     his cups is said to have secretly torn off his garlands from his\n     neck when he heard what that temperate teacher said?\u201d\n      --Horace, Sat., ii. 3, 253]\n\nThat seems to me to be the least contemptible condition of men, which by\nits plainness and simplicity is seated in the lowest degree, and invites\nus to a more regular course.  I find the rude manners and language of\ncountry people commonly better suited to the rule and prescription of\ntrue philosophy, than those of our philosophers themselves:\n\n     \u201cPlus sapit vulgus, quia tantum, quantum opus est, sapit.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThe vulgar are so much the wiser, because they only know what\n     is needful for them to know.\u201d--Lactantms, Instit. Div., iii. 5.]\n\nThe most remarkable men, as I have judged by outward appearance (for to\njudge of them according to my own method, I must penetrate a great deal\ndeeper), for soldiers and military conduct, were the Duc de Guise, who\ndied at Orleans, and the late Marshal Strozzi; and for men of great\nability and no common virtue, Olivier and De l\u2019Hospital, Chancellors of\nFrance.  Poetry, too, in my opinion, has flourished in this age of ours;\nwe have abundance of very good artificers in the trade: D\u2019Aurat, Beza,\nBuchanan, L\u2019Hospital, Montdore, Turnebus; as to the French poets, I\nbelieve they raised their art to the highest pitch to which it can ever\narrive; and in those parts of it wherein Ronsard and Du Bellay excel, I\nfind them little inferior to the ancient perfection.  Adrian Turnebus\nknew more, and what he did know, better than any man of his time, or long\nbefore him.  The lives of the last Duke of Alva, and of our Constable de\nMontmorency, were both of them great and noble, and that had many rare\nresemblances of fortune; but the beauty and glory of the death of the\nlast, in the sight of Paris and of his king, in their service, against\nhis nearest relations, at the head of an army through his conduct\nvictorious, and by a sudden stroke, in so extreme old age, merits\nmethinks to be recorded amongst the most remarkable events of our times.\nAs also the constant goodness, sweetness of manners, and conscientious\nfacility of Monsieur de la Noue, in so great an injustice of armed\nparties (the true school of treason, inhumanity, and robbery), wherein he\nalways kept up the reputation of a great and experienced captain.\n\nI have taken a delight to publish in several places the hopes I have of\nMarie de Gournay le Jars,\n\n     [She was adopted by him in 1588.  See Leon Feugere\u2019s Mademoiselle\n     de Gournay: \u2018Etude sur sa Vie et ses Ouvrages\u2019.]\n\nmy adopted daughter; and certainly beloved by me more than paternally,\nand enveloped in my retirement and solitude as one of the best parts of\nmy own being: I have no longer regard to anything in this world but her.\nAnd if a man may presage from her youth, her soul will one day be capable\nof very great things; and amongst others, of the perfection of that\nsacred friendship, to which we do not read that any of her sex could ever\nyet arrive; the sincerity and solidity of her manners are already\nsufficient for it, and her affection towards me more than superabundant,\nand such, in short, as that there is nothing more to be wished, if not\nthat the apprehension she has of my end, being now five-and-fifty years\nold, might not so much afflict her.  The judgment she made of my first\nEssays, being a woman, so young, and in this age, and alone in her own\ncountry; and the famous vehemence wherewith she loved me, and desired my\nacquaintance solely from the esteem she had thence of me, before she ever\nsaw my face, is an incident very worthy of consideration.\n\nOther virtues have had little or no credit in this age; but valour is\nbecome popular by our civil wars; and in this, we have souls brave even\nto perfection, and in so great number that the choice is impossible to\nmake.\n\nThis is all of extraordinary and uncommon grandeur that has hitherto\narrived at my knowledge.\n\n\n\n\n     ETEXT EDITOR\u2019S BOOKMARKS:\n\n     A generous heart ought not to belie its own thoughts\n     A man may play the fool in everything else, but not in poetry\n     Against my trifles you could say no more than I myself have said\n     Agitated betwixt hope and fear\n     All defence shows a face of war\n     Almanacs\n     An advantage in judgment we yield to none\n     Any old government better than change and alteration\n     Anything becomes foul when commended by the multitude\n     Appetite runs after that it has not\n     Armed parties (the true school of treason, inhumanity, robbery)\n     Authority to be dissected by the vain fancies of men\n     Authority which a graceful presence and a majestic mien beget\n     Be on which side you will, you have as fair a game to play\n     Beauty of stature is the only beauty of men\n     Believing Heaven concerned at our ordinary actions\n     Better at speaking than writing.

It is most true, I confess and know very well, that a mechanic\nwill scarce lift his eyes from his work to look at an ordinary man,\nwhereas a man will forsake his business and his shop to stare at an\neminent person when he comes into a town.  It misbecomes any other to\ngive his own character, but him who has qualities worthy of imitation,\nand whose life and opinions may serve for example: Caesar and Xenophon\nhad a just and solid foundation whereon to found their narrations, the\ngreatness of their own performances; and were to be wished that we had\nthe journals of Alexander the Great, the commentaries that Augustus,\nCato, Sylla, Brutus, and others left of their actions; of such persons\nmen love and contemplate the very statues even in copper and marble.\nThis remonstrance is very true; but it very little concerns me:\n\n         \u201cNon recito cuiquam, nisi amicis, idque coactus;\n          Non ubivis, coramve quibuslibet, in medio qui\n          Scripta foro recitant, sunt multi, quique lavantes.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cI repeat my poems only to my friends, and when bound to do so;\n     not before every one and everywhere; there are plenty of reciters\n     in the open market-place and at the baths.\u201d--Horace, sat. i. 4, 73.]\n\nI do not here form a statue to erect in the great square of a city, in a\nchurch, or any public place:\n\n         \u201cNon equidem hoc studeo, bullatis ut mihi nugis,\n          Pagina turgescat......\n          Secreti loquimur:\u201d\n\n     [\u201cI study not to make my pages swell with empty trifles;\n     you and I are talking in private.\u201d--Persius, Sat., v. 19.]\n\n\u2018tis for some corner of a library, or to entertain a neighbour,\na kinsman, a friend, who has a mind to renew his acquaintance and\nfamiliarity with me in this image of myself.  Others have been encouraged\nto speak of themselves, because they found the subject worthy and rich;\nI, on the contrary, am the bolder, by reason the subject is so poor and\nsterile that I cannot be suspected of ostentation.  I judge freely of the\nactions of others; I give little of my own to judge of, because they are\nnothing: I do not find so much good in myself, that I cannot tell it\nwithout blushing.\n\nWhat contentment would it not be to me to hear any one thus relate to me\nthe manners, faces, countenances, the ordinary words and fortunes of my\nancestors? how attentively should I listen to it!  In earnest, it would\nbe evil nature to despise so much as the pictures of our friends and\npredecessors, the fashion of their clothes and arms.  I preserve their\nwriting, seal, and a particular sword they wore, and have not thrown the\nlong staves my father used to carry in his hand, out of my closet.\n\n          \u201cPaterna vestis, et annulus, tanto charior est\n          posteris, quanto erga parentes major affectus.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cA father\u2019s garment and ring is by so much dearer to his posterity,\n     as there is the greater affection towards parents.\u201d\n      --St. Aug., De Civat. Dei, i. 13.]\n\nIf my posterity, nevertheless, shall be of another mind, I shall be\navenged on them; for they cannot care less for me than I shall then do\nfor them.  All the traffic that I have in this with the public is, that I\nborrow their utensils of writing, which are more easy and most at hand;\nand in recompense shall, peradventure, keep a pound of butter in the\nmarket from melting in the sun:--[Montaigne semi-seriously speculates on\nthe possibility of his MS. being used to wrap up butter.]\n\n              \u201cNe toga cordyllis, ne penula desit olivis;\n               Et laxas scombris saepe dabo tunicas;\u201d\n\n     [\u201cLet not wrappers be wanting to tunny-fish, nor olives;\n     and I shall supply loose coverings to mackerel.\u201d\n      --Martial, xiii.  I, I.]\n\nAnd though nobody should read me, have I wasted time in entertaining\nmyself so many idle hours in so pleasing and useful thoughts?  In\nmoulding this figure upon myself, I have been so often constrained to\ntemper and compose myself in a right posture, that the copy is truly\ntaken, and has in some sort formed itself; painting myself for others,\nI represent myself in a better colouring than my own natural complexion.\nI have no more made my book than my book has made me: \u2018tis a book\nconsubstantial with the author, of a peculiar design, a parcel of my\nlife, and whose business is not designed for others, as that of all other\nbooks is.  In giving myself so continual and so exact an account of\nmyself, have I lost my time?  For they who sometimes cursorily survey\nthemselves only, do not so strictly examine themselves, nor penetrate so\ndeep, as he who makes it his business, his study, and his employment, who\nintends a lasting record, with all his fidelity, and with all his force:\nThe most delicious pleasures digested within, avoid leaving any trace of\nthemselves, and avoid the sight not only of the people, but of any other\nperson.  How often has this work diverted me from troublesome thoughts?\nand all that are frivolous should be reputed so.  Nature has presented us\nwith a large faculty of entertaining ourselves alone; and often calls us\nto it, to teach us that we owe ourselves in part to society, but chiefly\nand mostly to ourselves.  That I may habituate my fancy even to meditate\nin some method and to some end, and to keep it from losing itself and\nroving at random, \u2018tis but to give to body and to record all the little\nthoughts that present themselves to it.  I give ear to my whimsies,\nbecause I am to record them.  It often falls out, that being displeased\nat some action that civility and reason will not permit me openly to\nreprove, I here disgorge myself, not without design of public\ninstruction: and also these poetical lashes,\n\n                   \u201cZon zur l\u2019oeil, ion sur le groin,\n                    Zon zur le dos du Sagoin,\u201d\n\n     [\u201cA slap on his eye, a slap on his snout, a slap on Sagoin\u2019s\n     back.\u201d--Marot. Fripelippes, Valet de Marot a Sagoin.]\n\n\nimprint themselves better upon paper than upon the flesh.  What if I\nlisten to books a little more attentively than ordinary, since I watch if\nI can purloin anything that may adorn or support my own?  I have not at\nall studied to make a book; but I have in some sort studied because I had\nmade it; if it be studying to scratch and pinch now one author, and then\nanother, either by the head or foot, not with any design to form opinions\nfrom them, but to assist, second, and fortify those I already have\nembraced. But whom shall we believe in the report he makes of himself in\nso corrupt an age?  considering there are so few, if, any at all, whom we\ncan believe when speaking of others, where there is less interest to lie.\nThe first thing done in the corruption of manners is banishing truth;\nfor, as Pindar says, to be true is the beginning of a great virtue, and\nthe first article that Plato requires in the governor of his Republic.\nThe truth of these days is not that which really is, but what every man\npersuades another man to believe; as we generally give the name of money\nnot only to pieces of the dust alloy, but even to the false also, if they\nwill pass.  Our nation has long been reproached with this vice; for\nSalvianus of Marseilles, who lived in the time of the Emperor\nValentinian, says that lying and forswearing themselves is with the\nFrench not a vice, but a way of speaking.  He who would enhance this\ntestimony, might say that it is now a virtue in them; men form and\nfashion themselves to it as to an exercise of honour; for dissimulation\nis one of the most notable qualities of this age.\n\nI have often considered whence this custom that we so religiously observe\nshould spring, of being more highly offended with the reproach of a vice\nso familiar to us than with any other, and that it should be the highest\ninsult that can in words be done us to reproach us with a lie.  Upon\nexamination, I find that it is natural most to defend the defects with\nwhich we are most tainted.  It seems as if by resenting and being moved\nat the accusation, we in some sort acquit ourselves of the fault; though\nwe have it in effect, we condemn it in outward appearance.  May it not\nalso be that this reproach seems to imply cowardice and feebleness of\nheart? of which can there be a more manifest sign than to eat a man\u2019s own\nwords--nay, to lie against a man\u2019s own knowledge?  Lying is a base vice;\na vice that one of the ancients portrays in the most odious colours when\nhe says, \u201cthat it is to manifest a contempt of God, and withal a fear of\nmen.\u201d  It is not possible more fully to represent the horror, baseness,\nand irregularity of it; for what can a man imagine more hateful and\ncontemptible than to be a coward towards men, and valiant against his\nMaker?  Our intelligence being by no other way communicable to one\nanother but by a particular word, he who falsifies that betrays public\nsociety.  \u2018Tis the only way by which we communicate our thoughts and\nwills; \u2018tis the interpreter of the soul, and if it deceive us, we no\nlonger know nor have further tie upon one another; if that deceive us, it\nbreaks all our correspondence, and dissolves all the ties of government.\nCertain nations of the newly discovered Indies (I need not give them\nnames, seeing they are no more; for, by wonderful and unheardof example,\nthe desolation of that conquest has extended to the utter abolition of\nnames and the ancient knowledge of places) offered to their gods human\nblood, but only such as was drawn from the tongue and ears, to expiate\nfor the sin of lying, as well heard as pronounced.  That good fellow of\nGreece--[Plutarch, Life of Lysander, c. 4.]--said that children are\namused with toys and men with words.\n\nAs to our diverse usages of giving the lie, and the laws of honour in\nthat case, and the alteration they have received, I defer saying what I\nknow of them to another time, and shall learn, if I can, in the\nmeanwhile, at what time the custom took beginning of so exactly weighing\nand measuring words, and of making our honour interested in them; for it\nis easy to judge that it was not anciently amongst the Romans and Greeks.\nAnd it has often seemed to me strange to see them rail at and give one\nanother the lie without any quarrel.  Their laws of duty steered some\nother course than ours.  Caesar is sometimes called thief, and sometimes\ndrunkard, to his teeth.  We see the liberty of invective they practised\nupon one another, I mean the greatest chiefs of war of both nations,\nwhere words are only revenged with words, and do not proceed any farther.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\nOF LIBERTY OF CONSCIENCE\n\n\u2018Tis usual to see good intentions, if carried on without moderation, push\nmen on to very vicious effects.  In this dispute which has at this time\nengaged France in a civil war, the better and the soundest cause no doubt\nis that which maintains the ancient religion and government of the\nkingdom.  Nevertheless, amongst the good men of that party (for I do not\nspeak of those who only make a pretence of it, either to execute their\nown particular revenges or to gratify their avarice, or to conciliate the\nfavour of princes, but of those who engage in the quarrel out of true\nzeal to religion and a holy desire to maintain the peace and government\nof their country), of these, I say, we see many whom passion transports\nbeyond the bounds of reason, and sometimes inspires with counsels that\nare unjust and violent, and, moreover, rash.\n\nIt is certain that in those first times, when our religion began to gain\nauthority with the laws, zeal armed many against all sorts of pagan\nbooks, by which the learned suffered an exceeding great loss, a disorder\nthat I conceive to have done more prejudice to letters than all the\nflames of the barbarians.  Of this Cornelius Tacitus is a very good\ntestimony; for though the Emperor Tacitus, his kinsman, had, by express\norder, furnished all the libraries in the world with it, nevertheless one\nentire copy could not escape the curious examination of those who desired\nto abolish it for only five or six idle clauses that were contrary to our\nbelief.\n\nThey had also the trick easily to lend undue praises to all the emperors\nwho made for us, and universally to condemn all the actions of those who\nwere adversaries, as is evidently manifest in the Emperor Julian,\nsurnamed the Apostate,\n\n     [The character of the Emperor Julian was censured, when Montaigne\n     was at Rome in 1581, by the Master of the Sacred Palace, who,\n     however, as Montaigne tells us in his journal (ii.  35), referred it\n     to his conscience to alter what he should think in bad taste.  This\n     Montaigne did not do, and this chapter supplied Voltaire with the\n     greater part of the praises he bestowed upon the Emperor.--Leclerc.]\n\nwho was, in truth, a very great and rare man, a man in whose soul\nphilosophy was imprinted in the best characters, by which he professed to\ngovern all his actions; and, in truth, there is no sort of virtue of\nwhich he has not left behind him very notable examples: in chastity (of\nwhich the whole of his life gave manifest proof) we read the same of him\nthat was said of Alexander and Scipio, that being in the flower of his\nage, for he was slain by the Parthians at one-and-thirty, of a great many\nvery beautiful captives, he would not so much as look upon one.  As to\nhis justice, he took himself the pains to hear the parties, and although\nhe would out of curiosity inquire what religion they were of,\nnevertheless, the antipathy he had to ours never gave any counterpoise to\nthe balance.  He made himself several good laws, and repealed a great\npart of the subsidies and taxes levied by his predecessors.\n\nWe have two good historians who were eyewitnesses of his actions: one of\nwhom, Marcellinus, in several places of his history sharply reproves an\nedict of his whereby he interdicted all Christian rhetoricians and\ngrammarians to keep school or to teach, and says he could wish that act\nof his had been buried in silence: it is probable that had he done any\nmore severe thing against us, he, so affectionate as he was to our party,\nwould not have passed it over in silence.  He was indeed sharp against\nus, but yet no cruel enemy; for our own people tell this story of him,\nthat one day, walking about the city of Chalcedon, Maris, bishop of the\nplace; was so bold as to tell him that he was impious, and an enemy to\nChrist, at which, they say, he was no further moved than to reply,\n\u201cGo, poor wretch, and lament the loss of thy eyes,\u201d to which the bishop\nreplied again, \u201cI thank Jesus Christ for taking away my sight, that I may\nnot see thy impudent visage,\u201d affecting in that, they say, a\nphilosophical patience.  But this action of his bears no comparison to\nthe cruelty that he is said to have exercised against us.  \u201cHe was,\u201d says\nEutropius,  my other witness, \u201can enemy to Christianity,  but without\nputting his hand to blood.\u201d  And, to return to his justice, there is\nnothing in that whereof he can be accused, the severity excepted he\npractised in the beginning of his reign against those who had followed\nthe party of Constantius, his predecessor.  As to his sobriety, he lived\nalways a soldier-like life; and observed a diet and routine, like one\nthat prepared and inured himself to the austerities of war.  His\nvigilance was such, that he divided the night into three or four parts,\nof which the least was dedicated to sleep; the rest was spent either in\nvisiting the state of his army and guards in person, or in study; for\namongst other rare qualities, he was very excellent in all sorts of\nlearning.  \u2018Tis said of Alexander the Great, that being in bed, for fear\nlest sleep should divert him from his thoughts and studies, he had always\na basin set by his bedside, and held one of his hands out with a ball of\ncopper in it, to the end, that, beginning to fall asleep, and his fingers\nleaving their hold, the ball by falling into the basin, might awake him.\nBut the other had his soul so bent upon what he had a mind to do, and so\nlittle disturbed with fumes by reason of his singular abstinence, that he\nhad no need of any such invention.  As to his military experience, he was\nexcellent in all the qualities of a great captain, as it was likely he\nshould, being almost all his life in a continual exercise of war, and\nmost of that time with us in France, against the Germans and Franks: we\nhardly read of any man who ever saw more dangers, or who made more\nfrequent proofs of his personal valour.\n\nHis death has something in it parallel with that of Epaminondas, for he\nwas wounded with an arrow, and tried to pull it out, and had done so, but\nthat, being edged, it cut and disabled his hand.  He incessantly called\nout that they should carry him again into the heat of the battle, to\nencourage his soldiers, who very bravely disputed the fight without him,\ntill night parted the armies.  He stood obliged to his philosophy for the\nsingular contempt he had for his life and all human things.  He had a\nfirm belief of the immortality of souls.\n\nIn matter of religion he was wrong throughout, and was surnamed the\nApostate for having relinquished ours: nevertheless, the opinion seems to\nme more probable, that he had never thoroughly embraced it, but had\ndissembled out of obedience to the laws, till he came to the empire.\nHe was in his own so superstitious, that he was laughed at for it by\nthose of his own time, of the same opinion, who jeeringly said, that had\nhe got the victory over the Parthians, he had destroyed the breed of oxen\nin the world to supply his sacrifices.  He was, moreover, besotted with\nthe art of divination, and gave authority to all sorts of predictions.\nHe said, amongst other things at his death, that he was obliged to the\ngods, and thanked them, in that they would not cut him off by surprise,\nhaving long before advertised him of the place and hour of his death, nor\nby a mean and unmanly death, more becoming lazy and delicate people; nor\nby a death that was languishing, long, and painful; and that they had\nthought him worthy to die after that noble manner, in the progress of his\nvictories, in the flower of his glory.  He had a vision like that of\nMarcus Brutus, that first threatened him in Gaul, and afterward appeared\nto him in Persia just before his death.  These words that some make him\nsay when he felt himself wounded: \u201cThou hast overcome, Nazarene\u201d; or as\nothers, \u201cContent thyself, Nazarene\u201d; would hardly have been omitted, had\nthey been believed, by my witnesses, who, being present in the army, have\nset down to the least motions and words of his end; no more than certain\nother miracles that are reported about it.\n\nAnd to return to my subject, he long nourished, says Marcellinus,\npaganism in his heart; but all his army being Christians, he durst not\nown it.  But in the end, seeing himself strong enough to dare to discover\nhimself, he caused the temples of the gods to be thrown open, and did his\nuttermost to set on foot and to encourage idolatry.  Which the better to\neffect, having at Constantinople found the people disunited, and also the\nprelates of the church divided amongst themselves, having convened them\nall before him, he earnestly admonished them to calm those civil\ndissensions, and that every one might freely, and without fear, follow\nhis own religion.  Which he the more sedulously solicited, in hope that\nthis licence would augment the schisms and factions of their division,\nand hinder the people from reuniting, and consequently fortifying\nthemselves against him by their unanimous intelligence and concord;\nhaving experienced by the cruelty of some Christians, that there is no\nbeast in the world so much to be feared by man as man; these are very\nnearly his words.\n\nWherein this is very worthy of consideration, that the Emperor Julian\nmade use of the same receipt of liberty of conscience to inflame the\ncivil dissensions that our kings do to extinguish them.  So that a man\nmay say on one side, that to give the people the reins to entertain every\nman his own opinion, is to scatter and sow division, and, as it were, to\nlend a hand to augment it, there being no legal impediment or restraint\nto stop or hinder their career; but, on the other side, a man may also\nsay, that to give the people the reins to entertain every man his own\nopinion, is to mollify and appease them by facility and toleration, and\nto dull the point which is whetted and made sharper by singularity,\nnovelty, and difficulty: and I think it is better for the honour of the\ndevotion of our kings, that not having been able to do what they would,\nthey have made a show of being willing to do what they could.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\nTHAT WE TASTE NOTHING PURE\n\nThe feebleness of our condition is such that things cannot, in their\nnatural simplicity and purity, fall into our use; the elements that we\nenjoy are changed, and so \u2018tis with metals; and gold must be debased with\nsome other matter to fit it for our service.  Neither has virtue, so\nsimple as that which Aristo, Pyrrho, and also the Stoics, made the end of\nlife; nor the Cyrenaic and Aristippic pleasure, been without mixture\nuseful to it.  Of the pleasure and goods that we enjoy, there is not one\nexempt from some mixture of ill and inconvenience:\n\n                         \u201cMedio de fonte leporum,\n          Surgit amari aliquid, quod in ipsis fioribus angat.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cFrom the very fountain of our pleasure, something rises that is\n     bitter, which even in flowers destroys.\u201d--Lucretius, iv. 1130.]\n\nOur extremest pleasure has some sort of groaning and complaining in it;\nwould you not say that it is dying of pain?  Nay, when we frame the image\nof it in its full excellence, we stuff it with sickly and painful\nepithets and qualities, languor, softness, feebleness, faintness,\n\u2018morbidezza\u2019: a great testimony of their consanguinity and\nconsubstantiality.  The most profound joy has more of severity than\ngaiety, in it.  The highest and fullest contentment offers more of the\ngrave than of the merry:\n\n               \u201cIpsa felicitas, se nisi temperat, premit.\u201d\n\n          [\u201cEven felicity, unless it moderate itself, oppresses?\u201d\n           --Seneca, Ep. 74.]\n\nPleasure chews and grinds us; according to the old Greek verse, which\nsays that the gods sell us all the goods they give us; that is to say,\nthat they give us nothing pure and perfect, and that we do not purchase\nbut at the price of some evil.\n\nLabour and pleasure, very unlike in nature, associate, nevertheless,\nby I know not what natural conjunction.  Socrates says, that some god\ntried to mix in one mass and to confound pain and pleasure, but not being\nable to do it; he bethought him at least to couple them by the tail.\nMetrodorus said, that in sorrow there is some mixture of pleasure.  I\nknow not whether or no he intended anything else by that saying; but for\nmy part, I am of opinion that there is design, consent, and complacency\nin giving a man\u2019s self up to melancholy. I say, that besides ambition,\nwhich may also have a stroke in the business, there is some shadow of\ndelight and delicacy which smiles upon and flatters us even in the very\nlap of melancholy.  Are there not some constitutions that feed upon it?\n\n                    \u201cEst quaedam flere voluptas;\u201d\n\n               [\u201c\u2018Tis a certain kind of pleasure to weep.\u201d\n                --Ovid, Trist., iv.  3, 27.]\n\nand one Attalus in Seneca says, that the memory of our lost friends is as\ngrateful to us, as bitterness in wine, when too old, is to the palate:\n\n                    \u201cMinister vetuli, puer, Falerni\n                    Inger\u2019 mi calices amariores\u201d--\n\n     [\u201cBoy, when you pour out old Falernian wine, the bitterest put\n     into my bowl.\u201d--Catullus, xxvii. I.]\n\nand as apples that have a sweet tartness.\n\nNature discovers this confusion to us; painters hold that the same\nmotions and grimaces of the face that serve for weeping; serve for\nlaughter too; and indeed, before the one or the other be finished, do but\nobserve the painter\u2019s manner of handling, and you will be in doubt to\nwhich of the two the design tends; and the extreme of laughter does at\nlast bring tears:\n\n               \u201cNullum sine auctoramento malum est.\u201d\n\n          [\u201cNo evil is without its compensation.\u201d--Seneca, Ep., 69.]\n\nWhen I imagine man abounding with all the conveniences that are to be\ndesired (let us put the case that all his members were always seized with\na pleasure like that of generation, in its most excessive height) I feel\nhim melting under the weight of his delight, and see him utterly unable\nto support so pure, so continual, and so universal a pleasure.  Indeed,\nhe is running away whilst he is there, and naturally makes haste to\nescape, as from a place where he cannot stand firm, and where he is\nafraid of sinking.\n\nWhen I religiously confess myself to myself, I find that the best virtue\nI have has in it some tincture of vice; and I am afraid that Plato, in\nhis purest virtue (I, who am as sincere and loyal a lover of virtue of\nthat stamp as any other whatever), if he had listened and laid his ear\nclose to himself and he did so no doubt--would have heard some jarring\nnote of human mixture, but faint and only perceptible to himself.  Man is\nwholly and throughout but patch and motley.  Even the laws of justice\nthemselves cannot subsist without mixture of injustice; insomuch that\nPlato says, they undertake to cut off the hydra\u2019s head, who pretend to\nclear the law of all inconveniences:\n\n          \u201cOmne magnum exemplum habet aliquid ex iniquo,\n          quod contra singulos utilitate publics rependitur,\u201d\n\n     [\u201cEvery great example has in it some mixture of injustice, which\n     recompenses the wrong done to particular men by the public utility.\u201d\n      --Annals, xiv. 44.]\n\nsays Tacitus.\n\nIt is likewise true, that for the use of life and the service of public\ncommerce, there may be some excesses in the purity and perspicacity of\nour minds; that penetrating light has in it too much of subtlety and\ncuriosity: we must a little stupefy and blunt them to render them more\nobedient to example and practice, and a little veil and obscure them, the\nbetter to proportion them to this dark and earthly life.  And therefore\ncommon and less speculative souls are found to be more proper for and\nmore successful in the management of affairs, and the elevated and\nexquisite opinions of philosophy unfit for business.  This sharp vivacity\nof soul, and the supple and restless volubility attending it, disturb our\nnegotiations.  We are to manage human enterprises more superficially and\nroughly, and leave a great part to fortune; it is not necessary to\nexamine affairs with so much subtlety and so deep: a man loses himself in\nthe consideration of many contrary lustres, and so many various forms:\n\n     \u201cVolutantibus res inter se pugnantes, obtorpuerunt.... animi.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cWhilst they considered of things so indifferent in themselves,\n     they were astonished, and knew not what to do.\u201d--Livy, xxxii. 20.]\n\n\u2018Tis what the ancients say of Simonides, that by reason his imagination\nsuggested to him, upon the question King Hiero had put to him--[What God\nwas.--Cicero, De Nat.  Deor., i.  22.]--(to answer which he had had many\ndays for thought), several sharp and subtle considerations, whilst he\ndoubted which was the most likely, he totally despaired of the truth.\n\nHe who dives into and in his inquisition comprehends all circumstances\nand consequences, hinders his election: a little engine well handled is\nsufficient for executions, whether of less or greater weight.  The best\nmanagers are those who can worst give account how they are so; while the\ngreatest talkers, for the most part, do nothing to purpose; I know one of\nthis sort of men, and a most excellent discourser upon all sorts of good\nhusbandry, who has miserably let a hundred thousand livres yearly revenue\nslip through his hands; I know another who talks, who better advises than\nany man of his counsel, and there is not in the world a fairer show of\nsoul and understanding than he has; nevertheless, when he comes to the\ntest, his servants find him quite another thing; not to make any mention\nof his misfortunes.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\nAGAINST IDLENESS\n\nThe Emperor Vespasian, being sick of the disease whereof he died, did not\nfor all that neglect to inquire after the state of the empire, and even\nin bed continually despatched very many affairs of great consequence; for\nwhich, being reproved by his physician, as a thing prejudicial to his\nhealth, \u201cAn emperor,\u201d said he, \u201cmust die standing.\u201d  A fine saying, in my\nopinion, and worthy a great prince.  The Emperor Adrian since made use of\nthe same words, and kings should be often put in mind of them, to make\nthem know that the great office conferred upon them of the command of so\nmany men, is not an employment of ease; and that there is nothing can so\njustly disgust a subject, and make him unwilling to expose himself to\nlabour and danger for the service of his prince, than to see him, in the\nmeantime, devoted to his ease and frivolous amusement, and to be\nsolicitous of his preservation who so much neglects that of his people.\n\nWhoever will take upon him to maintain that \u2018tis better for a prince to\ncarry on his wars by others, than in his own person, fortune will furnish\nhim with examples enough of those whose lieutenants have brought great\nenterprises to a happy issue, and of those also whose presence has done\nmore hurt than good: but no virtuous and valiant prince can with patience\nendure so dishonourable councils.  Under colour of saving his head, like\nthe statue of a saint, for the happiness of his kingdom, they degrade him\nfrom and declare him incapable of his office, which is military\nthroughout: I know one--[Probably Henry IV.]--who had much rather be\nbeaten, than to sleep whilst another fights for him; and who never\nwithout jealousy heard of any brave thing done even by his own officers\nin his absence.  And Soliman I. said, with very good reason, in my\nopinion, that victories obtained without the master were never complete.\nMuch more would he have said that that master ought to blush for shame,\nto pretend to any share in the honour, having contributed nothing to the\nwork, but his voice and thought; nor even so much as these, considering\nthat in such work as that, the direction and command that deserve honour\nare only such as are given upon the spot, and in the heat of the\nbusiness.  No pilot performs his office by standing still.  The princes\nof the Ottoman family, the chiefest in the world in military fortune,\nhave warmly embraced this opinion, and Bajazet II., with his son, who\nswerved from it, spending their time in science and other retired\nemployments, gave great blows to their empire; and Amurath III., now\nreigning, following their example, begins to find the same.  Was it not\nEdward III., King of England, who said this of our Charles V.: \u201cThere\nnever was king who so seldom put on his armour, and yet never king who\ngave me so much to do.\u201d  He had reason to think it strange, as an effect\nof chance more than of reason.  And let those seek out some other to join\nwith them than me, who will reckon the Kings of Castile and Portugal\namongst the warlike and magnanimous conquerors, because at the distance\nof twelve hundred leagues from their lazy abode, by the conduct of their\ncaptains, they made themselves masters of both Indies; of which it has to\nbe known if they would have had even the courage to go and in person\nenjoy them.\n\nThe Emperor Julian said yet further, that a philosopher and a brave man\nought not so much as to breathe; that is to say, not to allow any more to\nbodily necessities than what we cannot refuse; keeping the soul and body\nstill intent and busy about honourable, great, and virtuous things.  He\nwas ashamed if any one in public saw him spit, or sweat (which is said by\nsome, also, of the Lacedaemonian young men, and which Xenophon says of\nthe Persian), forasmuch as he conceived that exercise, continual labour,\nand sobriety, ought to have dried up all those superfluities.  What\nSeneca says will not be unfit for this place; which is, that the ancient\nRomans kept their youth always standing, and taught them nothing that\nthey were to learn sitting.\n\n\u2018Tis a generous desire to wish to die usefully and like a man, but the\neffect lies not so much in our resolution as in our good fortune; a\nthousand have proposed to themselves in battle, either to overcome or to\ndie, who have failed both in the one and the other, wounds and\nimprisonment crossing their design and compelling them to live against\ntheir will.  There are diseases that overthrow even our desires, and our\nknowledge.  Fortune ought not to second the vanity of the Roman legions,\nwho bound themselves by oath, either to overcome or die:\n\n     \u201cVictor, Marce Fabi, revertar ex acie: si fallo, Jovem patrem,\n     Gradivumque Martem aliosque iratos invoco deos.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cI will return, Marcus Fabius, a conqueror, from the fight:\n     and if I fail, I invoke Father Jove, Mars Gradivus, and the\n     other angry gods.\u201d--Livy, ii. 45.]\n\nThe Portuguese say that in a certain place of their conquest of the\nIndies, they met with soldiers who had condemned themselves, with\nhorrible execrations, to enter into no other composition but either to\ncause themselves to be slain, or to remain victorious; and had their\nheads and beards shaved in token of this vow.  \u2018Tis to much purpose for\nus to hazard ourselves and to be obstinate: it seems as if blows avoided\nthose who present themselves too briskly to them, and do not willingly\nfall upon those who too willingly seek them, and so defeat them of their\ndesign.  Such there have been, who, after having tried all ways, not\nhaving been able with all their endeavour to obtain the favour of dying\nby the hand of the enemy, have been constrained, to make good their\nresolution of bringing home the honour of victory or of losing their\nlives, to kill themselves even in the heat of battle.  Of which there are\nother examples, but this is one: Philistus, general of the naval army of\nDionysius the younger against the Syracusans, presented them battle which\nwas sharply disputed, their forces being equal: in this engagement, he\nhad the better at the first, through his own valour: but the Syracusans\ndrawing about his gally to environ him, after having done great things in\nhis own person to disengage himself and hoping for no relief, with his\nown hand he took away the life he had so liberally, and in vain, exposed\nto the enemy.\n\nMule Moloch, king of Fez, who lately won against Sebastian, king of\nPortugal, the battle so famous for the death of three kings, and for the\ntransmission of that great kingdom to the crown of Castile, was extremely\nsick when the Portuguese entered in an hostile manner into his dominions;\nand from that day forward grew worse and worse, still drawing nearer to\nand foreseeing his end; yet never did man better employ his own\nsufficiency more vigorously and bravely than he did upon this occasion.\nHe found himself too weak to undergo the pomp and ceremony of entering.\ninto his camp, which after their manner is very magnificent, and\ntherefore resigned that honour to his brother; but this was all of the\noffice of a general that he resigned; all the rest of greatest utility\nand necessity he most, exactly and gloriously performed in his own\nperson; his body lying upon a couch, but his judgment and courage upright\nand firm to his last gasp, and in some sort beyond it.  He might have\nwasted his enemy, indiscreetly advanced into his dominions, without\nstriking a blow; and it was a very unhappy occurrence, that for want of a\nlittle life or somebody to substitute in the conduct of this war and the\naffairs of a troubled state, he was compelled to seek a doubtful and\nbloody victory, having another by a better and surer way already in his\nhands.  Notwithstanding, he wonderfully managed the continuance of his\nsickness in consuming the enemy, and in drawing them far from the\nassistance of the navy and the ports they had on the coast of Africa,\neven till the last day of his life, which he designedly reserved for this\ngreat battle.  He arranged his battalions in a circular form, environing\nthe Portuguese army on every side, which round circle coming to close in\nand to draw up close together, not only hindered them in the conflict\n(which was very sharp through the valour of the young invading king),\nconsidering that they had every way to present a front, but prevented\ntheir flight after the defeat, so that finding all passages possessed and\nshut up by the enemy, they were constrained to close up together again:\n\n          \u201cCoacerventurque non solum caede, sed etiam fuga,\u201d\n\n          [\u201cPiled up not only in slaughter but in flight.\u201d]\n\nand there they were slain in heaps upon one another, leaving to the\nconqueror a very bloody and entire victory.  Dying, he caused himself to\nbe carried and hurried from place to place where most need was, and\npassing along the files, encouraged the captains and soldiers one after\nanother; but a corner of his main battalions being broken, he was not to\nbe held from mounting on horseback with his sword in his hand; he did his\nutmost to break from those about him, and to rush into the thickest of\nthe battle, they all the while withholding him, some by the bridle, some\nby his robe, and others by his stirrups.  This last effort totally\noverwhelmed the little life he had left; they again laid him upon his\nbed; but coming to himself, and starting as it were out of his swoon, all\nother faculties failing, to give his people notice that they were to\nconceal his death the most necessary command he had then to give, that\nhis soldiers might not be discouraged (with the news) he expired with his\nfinger upon his mouth, the ordinary sign of keeping silence.  Who ever\nlived so long and so far into death? whoever died so erect, or more like\na man?\n\nThe most extreme degree of courageously treating death, and the most\nnatural, is to look upon it not only without astonishment but without\ncare, continuing the wonted course of life even into it, as Cato did,\nwho entertained himself in study, and went to sleep, having a violent and\nbloody death in his heart, and the weapon in his hand with which he was\nresolved to despatch himself.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\nOF POSTING\n\nI have been none of the least able in this exercise, which is proper for\nmen of my pitch, well-knit and short; but I give it over; it shakes us\ntoo much to continue it long.  I was at this moment reading,  that King\nCyrus, the better to have news brought him from all parts of the empire,\nwhich was of a vast extent, caused it to be tried how far a horse could\ngo in a day without baiting, and at that distance appointed men, whose\nbusiness it was to have horses always in readiness, to mount those who\nwere despatched to him; and some say, that this swift way of posting is\nequal to that of the flight of cranes.\n\nCaesar says, that Lucius Vibullius Rufus, being in great haste to carry\nintelligence to Pompey, rode night and day, still taking fresh horses for\nthe greater diligence and speed; and he himself, as Suetonius reports,\ntravelled a hundred miles a day in a hired coach; but he was a furious\ncourier, for where the rivers stopped his way he passed them by swimming,\nwithout turning out of his way to look for either bridge or ford.\nTiberius Nero, going to see his brother Drusus, who was sick in Germany,\ntravelled two hundred miles in four-and-twenty hours, having three\ncoaches.  In the war of the Romans against King Antiochus, T. Sempronius\nGracchus, says Livy:\n\n         \u201cPer dispositos equos prope incredibili celeritate\n          ab Amphissa tertio die Pellam pervenit.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cBy pre-arranged relays of horses, he, with an almost incredible\n     speed, rode in three days from Amphissa to Pella.\u201d\n      --Livy, xxxvii. 7.]\n\nAnd it appears that they were established posts, and not horses purposely\nlaid in upon this occasion.\n\nCecina\u2019s invention to send back news to his family was much more quick,\nfor he took swallows along with him from home, and turned them out\ntowards their nests when he would send back any news; setting a mark of\nsome colour upon them to signify his meaning, according to what he and\nhis people had before agreed upon.\n\nAt the theatre at Rome masters of families carried pigeons in their\nbosoms to which they tied letters when they had a mind to send any orders\nto their people at home; and the pigeons were trained up to bring back an\nanswer.  D. Brutus made use of the same device when besieged in Modena,\nand others elsewhere have done the same.\n\nIn Peru they rode post upon men, who took them upon their shoulders in a\ncertain kind of litters made for that purpose, and ran with such agility\nthat, in their full speed, the first couriers transferred their load to\nthe second without making any stop.\n\nI understand that the Wallachians, the grand Signior\u2019s couriers, perform\nwonderful journeys, by reason they have liberty to dismount the first\nperson they meet upon the road, giving him their own tired horses; and\nthat to preserve themselves from being weary, they gird themselves\nstraight about the middle with a broad girdle;  but I could never find\nany benefit from this.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\nOF ILL MEANS EMPLOYED TO A GOOD END\n\nThere is wonderful relation and correspondence in this universal\ngovernment of the works of nature, which very well makes it appear that\nit is neither accidental nor carried on by divers masters.  The diseases\nand conditions of our bodies are, in like manner, manifest in states and\ngovernments; kingdoms and republics are founded, flourish, and decay with\nage as we do.  We are subject to a repletion of humours, useless and\ndangerous: whether of those that are good (for even those the physicians\nare afraid of; and seeing we have nothing in us that is stable, they say\nthat a too brisk and vigorous perfection of health must be abated by art,\nlest our nature, unable to rest in any certain condition, and not having\nwhither to rise to mend itself, make too sudden and too disorderly a\nretreat; and therefore prescribe wrestlers to purge and bleed, to qualify\nthat superabundant health), or else a repletion of evil humours, which is\nthe ordinary cause of sickness.  States are very often sick of the like\nrepletion, and various sorts of purgations have commonly been applied.\nSome times a great multitude of families are turned out to clear the\ncountry, who seek out new abodes elsewhere and encroach upon others.\nAfter this manner our ancient Franks came from the remotest part of\nGermany to seize upon Gaul, and to drive thence the first inhabitants;\nso was that infinite deluge of men made up who came into Italy under the\nconduct of Brennus and others; so the Goths and Vandals, and also the\npeople who now possess Greece, left their native country to go settle\nelsewhere, where they might have more room; and there are scarce two or\nthree little corners in the world that have not felt the effect of such\nremovals.  The Romans by this means erected their colonies; for,\nperceiving their city to grow immeasurably populous, they eased it of the\nmost unnecessary people, and sent them to inhabit and cultivate the lands\nconquered by them; sometimes also they purposely maintained wars with\nsome of their enemies, not only to keep their own men in action, for fear\nlest idleness, the mother of corruption, should bring upon them some\nworse inconvenience:\n\n              \u201cEt patimur longae pacis mala; saevior armis\n               Luxuria incumbit.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cAnd we suffer the ills of a long peace; luxury is more pernicious\n     than war.\u201d--Juvenal, vi. 291.]\n\nbut also to serve for a blood-letting to their Republic, and a little to\nevaporate the too vehement heat of their youth, to prune and clear the\nbranches from the stock too luxuriant in wood; and to this end it was\nthat they maintained so long a war with Carthage.\n\nIn the treaty of Bretigny, Edward III., king of England, would not, in\nthe general peace he then made with our king, comprehend the controversy\nabout the Duchy of Brittany, that he might have a place wherein to\ndischarge himself of his soldiers, and that the vast number of English he\nhad brought over to serve him in his expedition here might not return\nback into England.  And this also was one reason why our King Philip\nconsented to send his son John upon a foreign expedition, that he might\ntake along with him a great number of hot young men who were then in his\npay.\n\nThere--are many in our times who talk at this rate, wishing that\nthis hot emotion that is now amongst us might discharge itself in some\nneighbouring war, for fear lest all the peccant humours that now reign in\nthis politic body of ours may diffuse themselves farther, keep the fever\nstill in the height, and at last cause our total ruin; and, in truth, a\nforeign is much more supportable than a civil war, but I do not believe\nthat God will favour so unjust a design as to offend and quarrel with\nothers for our own advantage:\n\n              \u201cNil mihi tam valde placeat, Rhamnusia virgo,\n               Quod temere invitis suscipiatur heris.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cRhamnusian virgin, let nothing ever so greatly please me which is\n     taken without justice from the unwilling owners\u201d\n      --Catullus, lxviii. 77.]\n\nAnd yet the weakness of our condition often pushes us upon the necessity\nof making use of ill means to a good end.  Lycurgus, the most perfect\nlegislator that ever was, virtuous and invented this very unjust practice\nof making the helots, who were their slaves, drunk by force, to the end\nthat the Spartans, seeing them so lost and buried in wine, might abhor\nthe excess of this vice.  And yet those were still more to blame who of\nold gave leave that criminals, to what sort of death soever condemned,\nshould be cut up alive by the physicians, that they might make a true\ndiscovery of our inward parts, and build their art upon greater\ncertainty; for, if we must run into excesses, it is more excusable to do\nit for the health of the soul than that of the body; as the Romans\ntrained up the people to valour and the contempt of dangers and death by\nthose furious spectacles of gladiators and fencers, who, having to fight\nit out to the last, cut, mangled, and killed one another in their\npresence:\n\n         \u201cQuid vesani aliud sibi vult ars impia ludi,\n          Quid mortes juvenum, quid sanguine pasta voluptas?\u201d\n\n     [\u201cWhat other end does the impious art of the gladiators propose to\n     itself, what the slaughter of young men, what pleasure fed with\n     blood.\u201d--Prudentius, Contra Symmachum, ii. 643.]\n\nand this custom continued till the Emperor Theodosius\u2019 time:\n\n         \u201cArripe dilatam tua, dux, in tempora famam,\n          Quodque patris superest, successor laudis habeto\n          Nullus in urbe cadat, cujus sit poena voluptas....\n          Jam solis contenta feris, infamis arena\n          Nulla cruentatis homicidia ludat in armis.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cPrince, take the honours delayed for thy reign, and be successor\n     to thy fathers; henceforth let none at Rome be slain for sport.  Let\n     beasts\u2019 blood stain the infamous arena, and no more homicides be\n     there acted.\u201d--Prudentius, Contra Symmachum, ii. 643.]\n\nIt was, in truth, a wonderful example, and of great advantage for the\ntraining up the people, to see every day before their eyes a hundred; two\nhundred, nay, a thousand couples of men armed against one another, cut\none another to pieces with so great a constancy of courage, that they\nwere never heard to utter so much as one syllable of weakness or\ncommiseration; never seen to turn their backs, nor so much as to make one\ncowardly step to evade a blow, but rather exposed their necks to the\nadversary\u2019s sword and presented themselves to receive the stroke; and\nmany of them, when wounded to death, have sent to ask the spectators if\nthey were satisfied with their behaviour, before they lay down to die\nupon the place.  It was not enough for them to fight and to die bravely,\nbut cheerfully too; insomuch that they were hissed and cursed if they\nmade any hesitation about receiving their death.  The very girls\nthemselves set them on:\n\n              \u201cConsurgit ad ictus,\n               Et, quoties victor ferrum jugulo inserit, illa\n               Delicias ait esse suas, pectusque jacentis\n               Virgo modesta jubet converso pollice rumpi.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThe modest virgin is so delighted with the sport, that she\n     applauds the blow, and when the victor bathes his sword in his\n     fellow\u2019s throat, she says it is her pleasure, and with turned thumb\n     orders him to rip up the bosom of the prostrate victim.\u201d\n      --Prudentius, Contra Symmachum, ii. 617.]\n\nThe first Romans only condemned criminals to this example: but they\nafterwards employed innocent slaves in the work, and even freemen too,\nwho sold themselves to this purpose, nay, moreover, senators and knights\nof Rome, and also women:\n\n         \u201cNunc caput in mortem vendunt, et funus arena,\n          Atque hostem sibi quisque parat, cum bella quiescunt.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThey sell themselves to death and the circus, and, since the wars\n     are ceased, each for himself a foe prepares.\u201d\n      --Manilius, Astron., iv. 225.]\n\n              \u201cHos inter fremitus novosque lusus....\n               Stat sexus rudis insciusque ferri,\n               Et pugnas capit improbus viriles;\u201d\n\n\n     [\u201cAmidst these tumults and new sports, the tender sex, unskilled in\n     arms, immodestly engaged in manly fights.\u201d\n      --Statius, Sylv., i. 6, 51.]\n\nwhich I should think strange and incredible, if we were not accustomed\nevery day to see in our own wars many thousands of men of other nations,\nfor money to stake their blood and their lives in quarrels wherein they\nhave no manner of concern.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV\n\nOF THE ROMAN GRANDEUR\n\nI will only say a word or two of this infinite argument, to show the\nsimplicity of those who compare the pitiful greatness of these times with\nthat of Rome.  In the seventh book of Cicero\u2019s Familiar Epistles (and let\nthe grammarians put out that surname of familiar if they please, for in\ntruth it is not very suitable; and they who, instead of familiar, have\nsubstituted \u201cad Familiares,\u201d may gather something to justify them for so\ndoing out of what Suetonius says in the Life of Caesar, that there was a\nvolume of letters of his \u201cad Familiares \u201c) there is one directed to\nCaesar, then in Gaul, wherein Cicero repeats these words, which were in\nthe end of another letter that Caesar had written to him: \u201cAs to what\nconcerns Marcus Furius, whom you have recommended to me, I will make him\nking of Gaul, and if you would have me advance any other friend of yours\nsend him to me.\u201d  It was no new thing for a simple citizen of Rome, as\nCaesar then was, to dispose of kingdoms, for he took away that of King\nDeiotarus from him to give it to a gentleman of the city of Pergamus,\ncalled Mithridates; and they who wrote his Life record several cities\nsold by him; and Suetonius says, that he had once from King Ptolemy three\nmillions and six hundred thousand crowns, which was very like selling him\nhis own kingdom:\n\n          \u201cTot Galatae, tot Pontus, tot Lydia, nummis.\u201d\n\n          [\u201cSo much for Galatia, so much for Pontus,\n          so much for Lydia.\u201d--Claudius in Eutrop., i. 203.]\n\nMarcus Antonius said, that the greatness of the people of Rome was not\nso much seen in what they took, as in what they gave; and, indeed, some\nages before Antonius, they had dethroned one amongst the rest with so\nwonderful authority, that in all the Roman history I have not observed\nanything that more denotes the height of their power.  Antiochus\npossessed all Egypt, and was, moreover, ready to conquer Cyprus and other\nappendages of that empire: when being upon the progress of his victories,\nC. Popilius came to him from the Senate, and at their first meeting\nrefused to take him by the hand, till he had first read his letters,\nwhich after the king had read, and told him he would consider of them,\nPopilius made a circle about him with his cane, saying:--\u201cReturn me an\nanswer, that I may carry it back to the Senate, before thou stirrest out\nof this circle.\u201d   Antiochus, astonished at the roughness of so positive\na command, after a little pause, replied, \u201cI will obey the Senate\u2019s\ncommand.\u201d  Then Popilius saluted him as friend of the Roman people.\nTo have renounced claim to so great a monarchy, and a course of such\nsuccessful fortune, from the effects of three lines in writing!  Truly\nhe had reason, as he afterwards did, to send the Senate word by his\nambassadors, that he had received their order with the same respect as if\nit had come from the immortal gods.\n\nAll the kingdoms that Augustus gained by the right of war, he either\nrestored to those who had lost them or presented them to strangers.  And\nTacitus, in reference to this, speaking of Cogidunus, king of England,\ngives us, by a marvellous touch, an instance of that infinite power: the\nRomans, says he, were from all antiquity accustomed to leave the kings\nthey had subdued in possession of their kingdoms under their authority.\n\n          \u201cUt haberent instruments servitutis et reges.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThat they might have even kings to be their slaves.\u201d\n      --Livy, xlv. 13.]\n\n\u2018Tis probable that Solyman, whom we have seen make a gift of Hungary and\nother principalities, had therein more respect to this consideration than\nto that he was wont to allege, viz., that he was glutted and overcharged\nwith so many monarchies and so much dominion, as his own valour and that\nof his ancestors had acquired.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV\n\nNOT TO COUNTERFEIT BEING SICK\n\nThere is an epigram in Martial, and one of the very good ones--for he has\nof all sorts--where he pleasantly tells the story of Caelius, who, to\navoid making his court to some great men of Rome, to wait their rising,\nand to attend them abroad, pretended to have the gout; and the better to\ncolour this anointed his legs, and had them lapped up in a great many\nswathings, and perfectly counterfeited both the gesture and countenance\nof a gouty person; till in the end, Fortune did him the kindness to make\nhim one indeed:\n\n              \u201cQuantum curs potest et ars doloris\n               Desiit fingere Caelius podagram.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cHow great is the power of counterfeiting pain: Caelius has ceased\n     to feign the gout; he has got it.\u201d--Martial, Ep., vii. 39, 8.]\n\nI think I have read somewhere in Appian a story like this, of one who to\nescape the proscriptions of the triumvirs of Rome, and the better to be\nconcealed from the discovery of those who pursued him, having hidden\nhimself in a disguise, would yet add this invention, to counterfeit\nhaving but one eye; but when he came to have a little more liberty, and\nwent to take off the plaster he had a great while worn over his eye, he\nfound he had totally lost the sight of it indeed, and that it was\nabsolutely gone.  \u2018Tis possible that the action of sight was dulled from\nhaving been so long without exercise, and that the optic power was wholly\nretired into the other eye: for we evidently perceive that the eye we\nkeep shut sends some part of its virtue to its fellow, so that it will\nswell and grow bigger; and so inaction, with the heat of ligatures and,\nplasters, might very well have brought some gouty humour upon the\ncounterfeiter in Martial.\n\nReading in Froissart the vow of a troop of young English gentlemen, to\nkeep their left eyes bound up till they had arrived in France and\nperformed some notable exploit upon us, I have often been tickled with\nthis thought, that it might have befallen them as it did those others,\nand they might have returned with but an eye a-piece to their mistresses,\nfor whose sakes they had made this ridiculous vow.\n\nMothers have reason to rebuke their children when they counterfeit having\nbut one eye, squinting, lameness, or any other personal defect; for,\nbesides that their bodies being then so tender, may be subject to take an\nill bent, fortune, I know not how, sometimes seems to delight in taking\nus at our word; and I have heard several examples related of people who\nhave become really sick, by only feigning to be so.  I have always used,\nwhether on horseback or on foot, to carry a stick in my hand, and even to\naffect doing it with an elegant air; many have threatened that this fancy\nwould one day be turned into necessity: if so, I should be the first of\nmy family to have the gout.\n\nBut let us a little lengthen this chapter, and add another anecdote\nconcerning blindness.  Pliny reports of one who, dreaming he was blind,\nfound himself so indeed in the morning without any preceding infirmity in\nhis eyes.  The force of imagination might assist in this case, as I have\nsaid elsewhere, and Pliny seems to be of the same opinion; but it is more\nlikely that the motions which the body felt within, of which physicians,\nif they please, may find out the cause, taking away his sight, were the\noccasion of his dream.\n\nLet us add another story, not very improper for this subject, which\nSeneca relates in one of his epistles: \u201cYou know,\u201d says he, writing to\nLucilius, \u201cthat Harpaste, my wife\u2019s fool, is thrown upon me as an\nhereditary charge, for I have naturally an aversion to those monsters;\nand if I have a mind to laugh at a fool, I need not seek him far; I can\nlaugh at myself.  This fool has suddenly lost her sight: I tell you a\nstrange, but a very true thing she is not sensible that she is blind, but\neternally importunes her keeper to take her abroad, because she says the\nhouse is dark.  That what we laugh at in her, I pray you to believe,\nhappens to every one of us: no one knows himself to be avaricious or\ngrasping; and, again, the blind call for a guide, while we stray of our\nown accord.  I am not ambitious, we say; but a man cannot live otherwise\nat Rome; I am not wasteful, but the city requires a great outlay; \u2018tis\nnot my fault if I am choleric--if I have not yet established any certain\ncourse of life: \u2018tis the fault of youth.  Let us not seek our disease out\nof ourselves; \u2018tis in us, and planted in our bowels; and the mere fact\nthat we do not perceive ourselves to be sick, renders us more hard to be\ncured.  If we do not betimes begin to see to ourselves, when shall we\nhave provided for so many wounds and evils wherewith we abound?  And yet\nwe have a most sweet and charming medicine in philosophy; for of all the\nrest we are sensible of no pleasure till after the cure: this pleases and\nheals at once.\u201d  This is what Seneca says, that has carried me from my\nsubject, but there is advantage in the change.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI\n\nOF THUMBS\n\nTacitus reports, that amongst certain barbarian kings their manner was,\nwhen they would make a firm obligation, to join their right hands close\nto one another, and intertwist their thumbs; and when, by force of\nstraining the blood, it appeared in the ends, they lightly pricked them\nwith some sharp instrument, and mutually sucked them.\n\nPhysicians say that the thumbs are the master fingers of the hand, and\nthat their Latin etymology is derived from \u201cpollere.\u201d The Greeks called\nthem \u2018Avtixeip\u2019, as who should say, another hand.  And it seems that the\nLatins also sometimes take it in this sense for the whole hand:\n\n              \u201cSed nec vocibus excitata blandis,\n               Molli pollici nec rogata, surgit.\u201d\n\n          [\u201cNeither to be excited by soft words or by the thumb.\u201d\n           --Mart., xii. 98, 8.]\n\nIt was at Rome a signification of favour to depress and turn in the\nthumbs:\n\n          \u201cFautor utroque tuum laudabit pollice ludum:\u201d\n\n          [\u201cThy patron will applaud thy sport with both thumbs\u201d\n           --Horace.]\n\nand of disfavour to elevate and thrust them outward:\n\n                         \u201cConverso pollice vulgi,\n                    Quemlibet occidunt populariter.\u201d\n\n          [\u201cThe populace, with inverted thumbs, kill all that\n          come before them.\u201d--Juvenal, iii. 36]\n\nThe Romans exempted from war all such as were maimed in the thumbs, as\nhaving no more sufficient strength to hold their weapons.  Augustus\nconfiscated the estate of a Roman knight who had maliciously cut off the\nthumbs of two young children he had, to excuse them from going into the\narmies; and, before him, the Senate, in the time of the Italic war, had\ncondemned Caius Vatienus to perpetual imprisonment, and confiscated all\nhis goods, for having purposely cut off the thumb of his left hand, to\nexempt himself from that expedition.  Some one, I have forgotten who,\nhaving won a naval battle, cut off the thumbs of all his vanquished\nenemies, to render them incapable of fighting and of handling the oar.\nThe Athenians also caused the thumbs of the AEginatans to be cut off,\nto deprive them of the superiority in the art of navigation.\n\nIn Lacedaemon, pedagogues chastised their scholars by biting their\nthumbs.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII\n\nCOWARDICE THE MOTHER OF CRUELTY\n\nI have often heard it said that cowardice is the mother of cruelty; and I\nhave found by experience that malicious and inhuman animosity and\nfierceness are usually accompanied with feminine weakness.  I have seen\nthe most cruel people, and upon frivolous occasions, apt to cry.\nAlexander, the tyrant of Pheres, durst not be a spectator of tragedies in\nthe theatre, for fear lest his citizens should see him weep at the\nmisfortunes of Hecuba and Andromache, who himself without pity caused so\nmany people every day to be murdered.  Is it not meanness of spirit that\nrenders them so pliable to all extremities?  Valour, whose effect is only\nto be exercised against resistance--\n\n          \u201cNec nisi bellantis gaudet cervice juvenci\u201d--\n\n          [\u201cNor delights in killing a bull unless he resists.\u201d\n           --Claudius, Ep. ad Hadrianum, v. 39.]\n\nstops when it sees the enemy at its mercy; but pusillanimity, to say that\nit was also in the game, not having dared to meddle in the first act of\ndanger, takes as its part the second, of blood and massacre.  The murders\nin victories are commonly performed by the rascality and hangers-on of an\narmy, and that which causes so many unheard of cruelties in domestic wars\nis, that this canaille makes war in imbruing itself up to the elbows in\nblood, and ripping up a body that lies prostrate at its feet, having no\nsense of any other valour:\n\n         \u201cEt lupus, et turpes instant morientibus ursi,\n          Et quaecunque minor nobilitate fera est:\u201d\n\n     [\u201cWolves and the filthy bears, and all the baser beasts,\n     fall upon the dying.\u201d--Ovid, Trist., iii. 5, 35.]\n\nlike cowardly dogs, that in the house worry and tear the skins of wild\nbeasts, they durst not come near in the field.  What is it in these times\nof ours that makes our quarrels mortal; and that, whereas our fathers had\nsome degrees of revenge, we now begin with the last in ours, and at the\nfirst meeting nothing is to be said but, kill?  What is this but\ncowardice?\n\nEvery one is sensible that there is more bravery and disdain in subduing\nan enemy, than in cutting, his throat; and in making him yield, than in\nputting him to the sword: besides that the appetite of revenge is better\nsatisfied and pleased because its only aim is to make itself felt: And\nthis is the reason why we do not fall upon a beast or a stone when they\nhurt us, because they are not capable of being sensible of our revenge;\nand to kill a man is to save him from the injury and offence we intend\nhim.  And as Bias cried out to a wicked fellow, \u201cI know that sooner or\nlater thou wilt have thy reward, but I am afraid I shall not see it\u201d;\n--[Plutarch, on the Delay in Divine Justice, c. 2.]--and pitied the\nOrchomenians that the penitence of Lyciscus for the treason committed\nagainst them, came at a season when there was no one remaining alive of\nthose who had been interested in the offence, and whom the pleasure of\nthis penitence should affect: so revenge is to be pitied, when the person\non whom it is executed is deprived of means of suffering under it: for as\nthe avenger will look on to enjoy the pleasure of his revenge, so the\nperson on whom he takes revenge should be a spectator too, to be\nafflicted and to repent.  \u201cHe will repent it,\u201d we say, and because we\nhave given him a pistol-shot through the head, do we imagine he will\nrepent?  On the contrary, if we but observe, we shall find, that he makes\nmouths at us in falling, and is so far from penitency, that he does not\nso much as repine at us; and we do him the kindest office of life, which\nis to make him die insensibly, and soon: we are afterwards to hide\nourselves, and to shift and fly from the officers of justice, who pursue\nus, whilst he is at rest.  Killing is good to frustrate an offence to\ncome, not to revenge one that is already past; and more an act of fear\nthan of bravery; of precaution than of courage; of defence than of\nenterprise.  It is manifest that by it we lose both the true end of\nrevenge and the care of our reputation; we are afraid, if he lives he\nwill do us another injury as great as the first; \u2018tis not out of\nanimosity to him, but care of thyself, that thou gettest rid of him.\n\nIn the kingdom of Narsingah this expedient would be useless to us, where\nnot only soldiers, but tradesmen also, end their differences by the\nsword.  The king never denies the field to any who wish to fight; and\nwhen they are persons of quality; he looks on, rewarding the victor with\na chain of gold,--for which any one who pleases may fight with him again,\nso that, by having come off from one combat, he has engaged himself in\nmany.\n\nIf we thought by virtue to be always masters of our enemies, and to\ntriumph over them at pleasure, we should be sorry they should escape from\nus as they do, by dying: but we have a mind to conquer, more with safety\nthan honour, and, in our quarrel, more pursue the end than the glory.\n\nAsnius Pollio, who, as being a worthy man, was the less to be excused,\ncommitted a like, error, when, having written a libel against Plancus, he\nforbore to publish it till he was dead; which is to bite one\u2019s thumb at a\nblind man, to rail at one who is deaf, to wound a man who has no feeling,\nrather than to run the hazard of his resentment.  And it was also said of\nhim that it was only for hobgoblins to wrestle with the dead.\n\nHe who stays to see the author die, whose writings he intends to\nquestion, what does he say but that he is weak in his aggressiveness?\nIt was told to Aristotle that some one had spoken ill of him: \u201cLet him\ndo more,\u201d said he; \u201clet him whip me too, provided I am not there.\u201d\n\nOur fathers contented themselves with revenging an insult with the lie,\nthe lie with a box of the ear, and so forward; they were valiant enough\nnot to fear their adversaries, living and provoked we tremble for fear so\nsoon as we see them on foot.  And that this is so, does not our noble\npractice of these days, equally to prosecute to death both him that has\noffended us and him we have offended, make it out?  \u2018Tis also a kind\nof cowardice that has introduced the custom of having seconds, thirds,\nand fourths in our duels; they were formerly duels; they are now\nskirmishes, rencontres, and battles.  Solitude was, doubtless, terrible\nto those who were the first inventors of this practice:\n\n               \u201cQuum in se cuique minimum fiduciae esset,\u201d\n\nfor naturally any company whatever is consolatory in danger.  Third\npersons were formerly called in to prevent disorder and foul play only,\nand to be witness of the fortune of the combat; but now they have brought\nit to this pass that the witnesses themselves engage; whoever is invited\ncannot handsomely stand by as an idle spectator, for fear of being\nsuspected either of want of affection or of courage.  Besides the\ninjustice and unworthiness of such an action, of engaging other strength\nand valour in the protection of your honour than your own, I conceive it\na disadvantage to a brave man, and who wholly relies upon himself, to\nshuffle his fortune with that of a second; every one runs hazard enough\nhimself without hazarding for another, and has enough to do to assure\nhimself in his own valour for the defence of his life, without intrusting\na thing so dear in a third man\u2019s hand.  For, if it be not expressly\nagreed upon before to the contrary, \u2018tis a combined party of all four,\nand if your second be killed, you have two to deal withal, with good\nreason; and to say that it is foul play, it is so indeed, as it is, well\narmed, to attack a man who has but the hilt of a broken sword in his\nhand, or, clear and untouched, a man who is desperately wounded: but if\nthese be advantages you have got by fighting, you may make use of them\nwithout reproach.  The disparity and inequality are only weighed and\nconsidered from the condition of the combatants when they began; as to\nthe rest, you must take your chance: and though you had, alone, three\nenemies upon you at once, your two companions being killed, you have no\nmore wrong done you, than I should do in a battle, by running a man\nthrough whom I should see engaged with one of our own men, with the like\nadvantage.  The nature of society will have it so that where there is\ntroop against troop, as where our Duke of Orleans challenged Henry, king\nof England, a hundred against a hundred; three hundred against as many,\nas the Argians against the Lacedaemonians; three to three, as the Horatii\nagainst the Curiatii, the multitude on either side is considered but as\none single man: the hazard, wherever there is company, being confused and\nmixed.\n\nI have a domestic interest in this discourse; for my brother, the Sieur\nde Mattecoulom, was at Rome asked by a gentleman with whom he had no\ngreat acquaintance, and who was a defendant challenged by another, to be\nhis second; in this duel he found himself matched with a gentleman much\nbetter known to him.  (I would fain have an explanation of these rules of\nhonour, which so often shock and confound those of reason.)  After having\ndespatched his man, seeing the two principals still on foot and sound, he\nran in to disengage his friend.  What could he do less? should he have\nstood still, and if chance would have ordered it so, have seen him he was\ncome thither to defend killed before his face? what he had hitherto done\nhelped not the business; the quarrel was yet undecided.  The courtesy\nthat you can, and certainly ought to shew to your enemy, when you have\nreduced him to an ill condition and have a great advantage over him, I do\nnot see how you can do it, where the interest of another is concerned,\nwhere you are only called in as an assistant, and the quarrel is none of\nyours: he could neither be just nor courteous, at the hazard of him he\nwas there to serve.  And he was therefore enlarged from the prisons of\nItaly at the speedy and solemn request of our king.  Indiscreet nation!\nwe are not content to make our vices and follies known to the world by\nreport only, but we must go into foreign countries, there to show them\nwhat fools we are.  Put three Frenchmen into the deserts of Libya, they\nwill not live a month together without fighting; so that you would say\nthis peregrination were a thing purposely designed to give foreigners the\npleasure of our tragedies, and, for the most part, to such as rejoice and\nlaugh at our miseries.  We go into Italy to learn to fence, and exercise\nthe art at the expense of our lives before we have learned it; and yet,\nby the rule of discipline, we should put the theory before the practice.\nWe discover ourselves to be but learners:\n\n              \u201cPrimitae juvenum miserae, bellique futuri\n               Dura rudimenta.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cWretched the elementary trials of youth, and hard the\n     rudiments of approaching war.\u201d--Virgil, AEneid, xi. 156.]\n\nI know that fencing is an art very useful to its end (in a duel betwixt\ntwo princes, cousin-germans, in Spain, the elder, says Livy, by his skill\nand dexterity in arms, easily overcoming the greater and more awkward\nstrength of the younger), and of which the knowledge, as I experimentally\nknow, has inspired some with courage above their natural measure; but\nthis is not properly valour, because it supports itself upon address, and\nis founded upon something besides itself.  The honour of combat consists\nin the jealousy of courage, and not of skill; and therefore I have known\na friend of mine, famed as a great master in this exercise, in his\nquarrels make choice of such arms as might deprive him of this advantage\nand that wholly depended upon fortune and assurance, that they might not\nattribute his victory rather to his skill in fencing than his valour.\nWhen I was young, gentlemen avoided the reputation of good fencers as\ninjurious to them, and learned to fence with all imaginable privacy as a\ntrade of subtlety, derogating from true and natural valour:\n\n              \u201cNon schivar non parar, non ritirarsi,\n               Voglion costor, ne qui destrezza ha parte;\n               Non danno i colpi or finti, or pieni, or scarsi!\n               Toglie l\u2019ira a il furor l\u2019uso de l\u2019arte.\n               Odi le spade orribilmente utarsi\n               A mezzo il ferro; il pie d\u2019orma non parte,\n               Sempre a il pie fermo, a la man sempre in moto;\n               Ne scende taglio in van, ne punta a voto.\u201d\n\n          [\u201cThey neither shrank, nor vantage sought of ground,\n          They travers\u2019d not, nor skipt from part to part,\n          Their blows were neither false, nor feigned found:\n          In fight, their rage would let them use no art.\n          Their swords together clash with dreadful sound,\n          Their feet stand fast, and neither stir nor start,\n          They move their hands, steadfast their feet remain.\n          Nor blow nor foin they strook, or thrust in vain.\u201d\n           --Tasso, Gierus.  Lib., c. 12, st. 55, Fairfax\u2019s translation.]\n\nButts, tilting, and barriers, the feint of warlike fights, were the\nexercises of our forefathers: this other exercise is so much the less\nnoble, as it only respects a private end; that teaches us to destroy one\nanother against law and justice, and that every way always produces very\nill effects.  It is much more worthy and more becoming to exercise\nourselves in things that strengthen than that weaken our government and\nthat tend to the public safety and common glory.  The consul, Publius\nRutilius,  was the first who taught the soldiers to handle their arms\nwith skill, and joined art with valour, not for the rise of private\nquarrel, but for war and the quarrels of the people of Rome; a popular\nand civil defence.  And besides the example of Caesar,  who commanded his\nmen to shoot chiefly at the face of Pompey\u2019s soldiers in the battle of\nPharsalia, a thousand other commanders have also bethought them to invent\nnew forms of weapons and new ways of striking and defending, according as\noccasion should require.\n\nBut as Philopoemen condemned wrestling, wherein he excelled, because the\npreparatives that were therein employed were differing from those that\nappertain to military discipline, to which alone he conceived men of\nhonour ought wholly to apply themselves; so it seems to me that this\naddress to which we form our limbs, those writhings and motions young men\nare taught in this new school, are not only of no use, but rather\ncontrary and hurtful to the practice of fight in battle; and also our\npeople commonly make use of particular weapons, and peculiarly designed\nfor duel; and I have seen, when it has been disapproved, that a gentleman\nchallenged to fight with rapier and poignard appeared in the array of a\nman-at-arms, and that another should take his cloak instead of his\npoignard.  It is worthy of consideration that Laches in Plato, speaking\nof learning to fence after our manner, says that he never knew any great\nsoldier come out of that school, especially the masters of it: and,\nindeed, as to them, our experience tells as much.  As to the rest, we may\nat least conclude that they are qualities of no relation or\ncorrespondence; and in the education of the children of his government,\nPlato interdicts the art of boxing, introduced by Amycus and Epeius, and\nthat of wrestling, by Antaeus and Cercyo, because they have another end\nthan to render youth fit for the service of war and contribute nothing to\nit.  But I see that I have somewhat strayed from my theme.\n\nThe Emperor Mauricius, being advertised by dreams and several\nprognostics, that one Phocas, an obscure soldier, should kill him,\nquestioned his son-in-law, Philip, who this Phocas was, and what were his\nnature, qualities, and manners; and so soon as Philip, amongst other\nthings, had told him that he was cowardly and timorous, the emperor\nimmediately concluded then that he was a murderer and cruel.  What is it\nthat makes tyrants so sanguinary?  \u2018Tis only the solicitude for their own\nsafety, and that their faint hearts can furnish them with no other means\nof securing themselves than in exterminating those who may hurt them,\neven so much as women, for fear of a scratch:\n\n               \u201cCuncta ferit, dum cuncta timer.\u201d\n\n               [\u201cHe strikes at all who fears all.\u201d\n                --Claudius, in Eutrop., i. 182.]\n\nThe first cruelties are exercised for themselves thence springs the fear\nof a just revenge, which afterwards produces a series of new cruelties,\nto obliterate one another.  Philip, king of Macedon, who had so much to\ndo with the people of Rome, agitated with the horror of so many murders\ncommitted by his order, and doubting of being able to keep himself secure\nfrom so many families, at divers times mortally injured and offended by\nhim, resolved to seize all the children of those he had caused to be\nslain, to despatch them daily one after another, and so to establish his\nown repose.\n\nFine matter is never impertinent, however placed; and therefore I, who\nmore consider the weight and utility of what I deliver than its order and\nconnection, need not fear in this place to bring in an excellent story,\nthough it be a little by-the-by; for when they are rich in their own\nnative beauty, and are able to justify themselves, the least end of a\nhair will serve to draw them into my discourse.\n\nAmongst others condemned by Philip, had been one Herodicus, prince of\nThessaly; he had, moreover, after him caused his two sons-in-law to be\nput to death, each leaving a son very young behind him.  Theoxena and\nArcho were their two widows.  Theoxena, though highly courted to it,\ncould not be persuaded to marry again: Archo married Poris, the greatest\nman among the AEnians, and by him had a great many children, whom she,\ndying, left at a very tender age.  Theoxena, moved with a maternal\ncharity towards her nephews, that she might have them under her own eyes\nand in her own protection, married Poris: when presently comes a\nproclamation of the king\u2019s edict.  This brave-spirited mother, suspecting\nthe cruelty of Philip, and afraid of the insolence of the soldiers\ntowards these charming and tender children was so bold as to declare hat\nshe would rather kill them with her own hands than deliver them.  Poris,\nstartled at this protestation, promised her to steal them away, and to\ntransport them to Athens, and there commit them to the custody of some\nfaithful friends of his.  They took, therefore, the opportunity of an\nannual feast which was celebrated at AEnia in honour of AEneas, and\nthither they went.  Having appeared by day at the public ceremonies and\nbanquet, they stole the night following into a vessel laid ready for the\npurpose, to escape away by sea.  The wind proved contrary, and finding\nthemselves in the morning within sight of the land whence they had\nlaunched overnight, and being pursued by the guards of the port, Poris\nperceiving this, laboured all he could to make the mariners do their\nutmost to escape from the pursuers.  But Theoxena, frantic with affection\nand revenge, in pursuance of her former resolution, prepared both weapons\nand poison, and exposing them before them; \u201cGo to, my children,\u201d said\nshe, \u201cdeath is now the only means of your defence and liberty, and shall\nadminister occasion to the gods to exercise their sacred justice: these\nsharp swords, and these full cups, will open you the way into it;\ncourage, fear nothing!  And thou, my son, who art the eldest, take this\nsteel into thy hand, that thou mayest the more bravely die.\u201d  The\nchildren having on one side so powerful a counsellor, and the enemy at\ntheir throats on the other, run all of them eagerly upon what was next to\nhand; and, half dead, were thrown into the sea.  Theoxena, proud of\nhaving so gloriously provided for the safety of her children, clasping\nher arms with great affection about her husband\u2019s neck.  \u201cLet us, my\nfriend,\u201d said she, \u201cfollow these boys, and enjoy the same sepulchre they\ndo\u201d; and so, having embraced, they threw themselves headlong into the\nsea; so that the ship was carried--back without the owners into the\nharbour.\n\nTyrants, at once both to kill and to make their anger felt, have employed\ntheir capacity to invent the most lingering deaths.  They will have their\nenemies despatched, but not so fast that they may not have leisure to\ntaste their vengeance.  And therein they are mightily perplexed; for if\nthe torments they inflict are violent, they are short; if long, they are\nnot then so painful as they desire; and thus plague themselves in choice\nof the greatest cruelty.  Of this we have a thousand examples in\nantiquity, and I know not whether we, unawares, do not retain some traces\nof this barbarity.\n\nAll that exceeds a simple death appears to me absolute cruelty.  Our\njustice cannot expect that he, whom the fear of dying by being beheaded\nor hanged will not restrain, should be any more awed by the imagination\nof a languishing fire, pincers, or the wheel.  And I know not, in the\nmeantime, whether we do not throw them into despair; for in what\ncondition can be the soul of a man, expecting four-and-twenty hours\ntogether to be broken upon a wheel, or after the old way, nailed to a\ncross?  Josephus relates that in the time of the war the Romans made in\nJudaea, happening to pass by where they had three days before crucified\ncertain Jews, he amongst them knew three of his own friends, and obtained\nthe favour of having them taken down, of whom two, he says, died; the\nthird lived a great while after.\n\nChalcondylas, a writer of good credit, in the records he has left behind\nhim of things that happened in his time, and near him, tells us, as of\nthe most excessive torment, of that the Emperor Mohammed very often\npractised, of cutting off men in the middle by the diaphragm with one\nblow of a scimitar, whence it followed that they died as it were two\ndeaths at once; and both the one part, says he, and the other, were seen\nto stir and strive a great while after in very great torment.  I do not\nthink there was any great suffering in this motion the torments that are\nthe most dreadful to look on are not always the greatest to endure; and I\nfind those that other historians relate to have been practised by him\nupon the Epirot lords, are more horrid and cruel, where they were\ncondemned to be flayed alive piecemeal, after so malicious a manner that\nthey continued fifteen days in that misery.\n\nAnd these other two: Croesus, having caused a gentleman, the favourite of\nhis brother Pantaleon, to be seized, carried him into a fuller\u2019s shop,\nwhere he caused him to be scratched and carded with the cards and combs\nbelonging to that trade, till he died.  George Sechel, chief commander of\nthe peasants of Poland, who committed so many mischiefs under the title\nof the Crusade, being defeated in battle and taken bu the Vayvode of\nTransylvania, was three days bound naked upon the rack exposed to all\nsorts of torments that any one could contrive against him: during which\ntime many other prisoners were kept fasting; in the end, he living and\nlooking on, they made his beloved brother Lucat, for whom alone he\nentreated, taking on himself the blame of all their evil actions drink\nhis blood, and caused twenty of his most favoured captains to feed upon\nhim, tearing his flesh in pieces with their teeth, and swallowing the\nmorsels.  The remainder of his body and his bowels, so soon as he was\ndead, were boiled, and others of his followers compelled to eat them.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII\n\nALL THINGS HAVE THEIR SEASON\n\nSuch as compare Cato the Censor with the younger Cato, who killed\nhimself, compare two beautiful natures, much resembling one another.\nThe first acquired his reputation several ways, and excels in military\nexploits and the utility of his public employments; but the virtue of the\nyounger, besides that it were blasphemy to compare any to it in vigour,\nwas much more pure and unblemished.  For who could absolve that of the\nCensor from envy and ambition, having dared to attack the honour of\nScipio, a man in goodness and all other excellent qualities infinitely\nbeyond him or any other of his time?\n\nThat which they, report of him, amongst other things, that in his extreme\nold age he put himself upon learning the Greek tongue with so greedy an\nappetite, as if to quench a long thirst, does not seem to me to make much\nfor his honour; it being properly what we call falling into second\nchildhood.  All things have their seasons, even good ones, and I may say\nmy Paternoster out of time; as they accused T. Quintus Flaminius, that\nbeing general of an army, he was seen praying apart in the time of a\nbattle that he won.\n\n          \u201cImponit finem sapiens et rebus honestis.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThe wise man limits even honest things.\u201d--Juvenal, vi. 444]\n\nEudemonidas, seeing Xenocrates when very old, still very intent upon his\nschool lectures: \u201cWhen will this man be wise,\u201d said he, \u201cif he is yet\nlearning?\u201d  And Philopaemen, to those who extolled King Ptolemy for every\nday inuring his person to the exercise of arms: \u201cIt is not,\u201d said he,\n\u201ccommendable in a king of his age to exercise himself in these things; he\nought now really to employ them.\u201d  The young are to make their\npreparations, the old to enjoy them, say the sages: and the greatest vice\nthey observe in us is that our desires incessantly grow young again; we\nare always re-beginning to live.\n\nOur studies and desires should sometime be sensible of age; yet we have\none foot in the grave and still our appetites and pursuits spring every\nday anew within us:\n\n                   \u201cTu secanda marmora\n                    Locas sub ipsum funus, et, sepulcri\n                    Immemor, struis domos.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cYou against the time of death have marble cut for use, and,\n     forgetful of the tomb, build houses.\u201d--Horace, Od., ii. 18, 17.]\n\nThe longest of my designs is not of above a year\u2019s extent; I think of\nnothing now but ending; rid myself of all new hopes and enterprises; take\nmy last leave of every place I depart from, and every day dispossess\nmyself of what I have.\n\n          \u201cOlim jam nec perit quicquam mihi, nec acquiritur....\n          plus superest viatici quam viae.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cHenceforward I will neither lose, nor expect to get: I have more\n     wherewith to defray my journey, than I have way to go.\u201d  (Or):\n     \u201cHitherto nothing of me has been lost or gained; more remains to pay\n     the way than there is way.\u201d--Seneca, Ep., 77.  (The sense seems to\n     be that so far he had met his expenses, but that for the future he\n     was likely to have more than he required.)]\n\n          \u201cVixi, et, quem dederat cursum fortuna, peregi.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cI have lived and finished the career Fortune placed before me.\u201d\n      --AEneid, iv. 653.]\n\n\u2018Tis indeed the only comfort I find in my old age, that it mortifies in\nme several cares and desires wherewith my life has been disturbed; the\ncare how the world goes, the care of riches, of grandeur, of knowledge,\nof health, of myself.  There are men who are learning to speak at a time\nwhen they should learn to be silent for ever.  A man may always study,\nbut he must not always go to school what a contemptible thing is an old\nAbecedarian!--[Seneca, Ep. 36]\n\n              \u201cDiversos diversa juvant; non omnibus annis\n               Omnia conveniunt.\u201d\n\n          [\u201cVarious things delight various men; all things are not\n          for all ages.\u201d--Gall., Eleg., i. 104.]\n\nIf we must study, let us study what is suitable to our present condition,\nthat we may answer as he did, who being asked to what end he studied in\nhis decrepit age, \u201cthat I may go out better,\u201d said he, \u201cand at greater\nease.\u201d  Such a study was that of the younger Cato, feeling his end\napproach, and which he met with in Plato\u2019s Discourse of the Eternity of\nthe Soul: not, as we are to believe, that he was not long before\nfurnished with all sorts of provision for such a departure; for of\nassurance, an established will and instruction, he had more than Plato\nhad in all his writings; his knowledge and courage were in this respect\nabove philosophy; he applied himself to this study, not for the service\nof his death; but, as a man whose sleeps were never disturbed in the\nimportance of such a deliberation, he also, without choice or change,\ncontinued his studies with the other accustomary actions of his life.\nThe night that he was denied the praetorship he spent in play; that\nwherein he was to die he spent in reading.  The loss either of life\nor of office was all one to him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX\n\nOF VIRTUE\n\nI find by experience, that there is a good deal to be said betwixt the\nflights and emotions of the soul or a resolute and constant habit; and\nvery well perceive that there is nothing we may not do, nay, even to the\nsurpassing the Divinity itself, says a certain person, forasmuch as it is\nmore to render a man\u2019s self impassible by his own study and industry,\nthan to be so by his natural condition; and even to be able to conjoin to\nman\u2019s imbecility and frailty a God-like resolution and assurance; but it\nis by fits and starts; and in the lives of those heroes of times past\nthere are sometimes miraculous impulses, and that seem infinitely to\nexceed our natural force; but they are indeed only impulses: and \u2018tis\nhard to believe, that these so elevated qualities in a man can so\nthoroughly tinct and imbue the soul that they should become ordinary,\nand, as it were, natural in him.  It accidentally happens even to us,\nwho are but abortive births of men, sometimes to launch our souls, when\nroused by the discourses or examples of others, much beyond their\nordinary stretch; but \u2018tis a kind of passion which pushes and agitates\nthem, and in some sort ravishes them from themselves: but, this\nperturbation once overcome, we see that they insensibly flag and slacken\nof themselves, if not to the lowest degree, at least so as to be no more\nthe same; insomuch as that upon every trivial occasion, the losing of a\nbird, or the breaking, of a glass, we suffer ourselves to be moved little\nless than one of the common people.  I am of opinion, that order,\nmoderation, and constancy excepted, all things are to be done by a man\nthat is very imperfect and defective in general.  Therefore it is, say\nthe Sages, that to make a right judgment of a man, you are chiefly to pry\ninto his common actions, and surprise him in his everyday habit.\n\nPyrrho, he who erected so pleasant a knowledge upon ignorance,\nendeavoured, as all the rest who were really philosophers did, to make\nhis life correspond with his doctrine.  And because he maintained the\nimbecility of human judgment to be so extreme as to be incapable of any\nchoice or inclination, and would have it perpetually wavering and\nsuspended, considering and receiving all things as indifferent, \u2018tis\nsaid, that he always comforted himself after the same manner and\ncountenance: if he had begun a discourse, he would always end what he had\nto say, though the person he was speaking to had gone away: if he walked,\nhe never stopped for any impediment that stood in his way, being\npreserved from precipices, collision with carts, and other like\naccidents, by the care of his friends: for, to fear or to avoid anything,\nhad been to shock his own propositions, which deprived the senses\nthemselves of all election and certainty.  Sometimes he suffered incision\nand cauteries with so great constancy as never to be seen so much as to\nwince.  \u2018Tis something to bring the soul to these imaginations; \u2018tis more\nto join the effects, and yet not impossible; but to conjoin them with\nsuch perseverance and constancy as to make them habitual, is certainly,\nin attempts so remote from the common usage, almost incredible to be\ndone.  Therefore it was, that being sometime taken in his house sharply\nscolding with his sister, and being reproached that he therein\ntransgressed his own rules of indifference: \u201cWhat!\u201d said he, \u201cmust this\nbit of a woman also serve for a testimony to my rules?\u201d  Another time,\nbeing seen to defend himself against a dog: \u201cIt is,\u201d said he, \u201cvery hard\ntotally to put off man; and we must endeavour and force ourselves to\nresist and encounter things, first by effects, but at least by reason and\nargument.\u201d\n\nAbout seven or eight years since, a husbandman yet living, but two\nleagues from my house, having long been tormented with his wife\u2019s\njealousy, coming one day home from his work, and she welcoming him with\nher accustomed railing, entered into so great fury that with a sickle he\nhad yet in his hand, he totally cut off all those parts that she was\njealous of and threw them in her face.  And, \u2018tis said that a young\ngentleman of our nation, brisk and amorous, having by his perseverance at\nlast mollified the heart of a fair mistress, enraged, that upon the point\nof fruition he found himself unable to perform, and that,\n\n                         \u201cNec viriliter\n          Iners senile penis extulit caput.\u201d\n\n     [(The 19th or 20th century translators leave this phrase\n     untranslated and with no explanation. D.W.)\n     --Tibullus, Priap.  Carm., 84.]\n\nas soon as ever he came home he deprived himself of the rebellious\nmember, and sent it to his mistress, a cruel and bloody victim for the\nexpiation of his offence.  If this had been done upon mature\nconsideration, and upon the account of religion, as the priests of Cybele\ndid, what should we say of so high an action?\n\nA few days since, at Bergerac, five leagues from my house, up the river\nDordogne, a woman having overnight been beaten and abused by her husband,\na choleric ill-conditioned fellow, resolved to escape from his ill-usage\nat the price of her life; and going so soon as she was up the next\nmorning to visit her neighbours, as she was wont to do, and having let\nsome words fall in recommendation of her affairs, she took a sister of\nhers by the hand, and led her to the bridge; whither being come, and\nhaving taken leave of her, in jest as it were, without any manner of\nalteration in her countenance, she threw herself headlong from the top\ninto the river, and was there drowned.  That which is the most remarkable\nin this is, that this resolution was a whole night forming in her head.\n\nIt is quite another thing with the Indian women for it being the custom\nthere for the men to have many wives, and the best beloved of them to\nkill herself at her husband\u2019s decease, every one of them makes it the\nbusiness of her whole life to obtain this privilege and gain this\nadvantage over her companions; and the good offices they do their\nhusbands aim at no other recompense but to be preferred in accompanying\nhim in death:\n\n              \u201cUbi mortifero jacta est fax ultima lecto,\n               Uxorum fusis stat pia turba comis\n               Et certamen habent lethi, quae viva sequatur\n               Conjugium: pudor est non licuisse mori.\n               Ardent victrices, et flammae pectora praebent,\n               Imponuntque suis ora perusta viris.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cFor when they threw the torch on the funeral bed, the pious wives\n     with hair dishevelled, stand around striving, which, living, shall\n     accompany her spouse; and are ashamed that they may not die; they\n     who are preferred expose their breasts to the flame, and they lay\n     their scorched lips on those of their husbands.\u201d\n      --Propertius, iii. 13, 17.]\n\nA certain author of our times reports that he has seen in those Oriental\nnations this custom in practice, that not only the wives bury themselves\nwith their husbands, but even the slaves he has enjoyed also; which is\ndone after this manner: The husband being dead, the widow may if she will\n(but few will) demand two or three months\u2019 respite wherein to order her\naffairs.  The day being come, she mounts on horseback, dressed as fine as\nat her wedding, and with a cheerful countenance says she is going to\nsleep with her spouse, holding a looking-glass in her left hand and an\narrow in the other.  Being thus conducted in pomp, accompanied with her\nkindred and friends and a great concourse of people in great joy, she is\nat last brought to the public place appointed for such spectacles: this\nis a great space, in the midst of which is a pit full of wood, and\nadjoining to it a mount raised four or five steps, upon which she is\nbrought and served with a magnificent repast; which being done, she falls\nto dancing and singing, and gives order, when she thinks fit, to kindle\nthe fire.  This being done, she descends, and taking the nearest of her\nhusband\u2019s relations by the hand, they walk to the river close by, where\nshe strips herself stark naked, and having distributed her clothes and\njewels to her friends, plunges herself into the water, as if there to\ncleanse herself from her sins; coming out thence, she wraps herself in a\nyellow linen of five-and-twenty ells long, and again giving her hand to\nthis kinsman of her husband\u2019s, they return back to the mount, where she\nmakes a speech to the people, and recommends her children to them, if she\nhave any.  Betwixt the pit and the mount there is commonly a curtain\ndrawn to screen the burning furnace from their sight, which some of them,\nto manifest the greater courage, forbid.  Having ended what she has to\nsay, a woman presents her with a vessel of oil, wherewith to anoint her\nhead and her whole body, which when done with she throws into the fire,\nand in an instant precipitates herself after.  Immediately, the people\nthrow a good many billets and logs upon her that she may not be long in\ndying, and convert all their joy into sorrow and mourning.  If they are\npersons of meaner condition, the body of the defunct is carried to the\nplace of sepulture, and there placed sitting, the widow kneeling before\nhim, embracing the dead body; and they continue in this posture whilst\nthe people build a wall about them, which so soon as it is raised to the\nheight of the woman\u2019s shoulders, one of her relations comes behind her,\nand taking hold of her head, twists her neck; so soon as she is dead, the\nwall is presently raised up, and closed, and there they remain entombed.\n\nThere was, in this same country, something like this in their\ngymnosophists; for not by constraint of others nor by the impetuosity of\na sudden humour, but by the express profession of their order, their\ncustom was, as soon as they arrived at a certain age, or that they saw\nthemselves threatened by any disease, to cause a funeral pile to be\nerected for them, and on the top a stately bed, where, after having\njoyfully feasted their friends and acquaintance, they laid them down with\nso great resolution, that fire being applied to it, they were never seen\nto stir either hand or foot; and after this manner, one of them, Calanus\nby name; expired in the presence of the whole army of Alexander the\nGreat.  And he was neither reputed holy nor happy amongst them who did\nnot thus destroy himself, dismissing his soul purged and purified by the\nfire, after having consumed all that was earthly and mortal.  This\nconstant premeditation of the whole life is that which makes the wonder.\n\nAmongst our other controversies, that of \u2018Fatum\u2019 has also crept in; and\nto tie things to come, and even our own wills, to a certain and\ninevitable necessity, we are yet upon this argument of time past:\n\u201cSince God foresees that all things shall so fall out, as doubtless He\ndoes, it must then necessarily follow, that they must so fall out\u201d: to\nwhich our masters reply: \u201cthat the seeing anything come to pass, as we\ndo, and as God Himself also does (for all things being present with him,\nHe rather sees, than foresees), is not to compel an event: that is, we\nsee because things do fall out, but things do not fall out because we\nsee: events cause knowledge, but knowledge does not cause events.  That\nwhich we see happen, does happen; but it might have happened otherwise:\nand God, in the catalogue of the causes of events which He has in His\nprescience, has also those which we call accidental and voluntary,\ndepending upon the liberty.  He has given our free will, and knows that\nwe do amiss because we would do so.\u201d\n\nI have seen a great many commanders encourage their soldiers with this\nfatal necessity; for if our time be limited to a certain hour, neither\nthe enemies\u2019 shot nor our own boldness, nor our flight and cowardice,\ncan either shorten or prolong our lives.  This is easily said, but see\nwho will be so easily persuaded; and if it be so that a strong and lively\nfaith draws along with it actions of the same kind, certainly this faith\nwe so much brag of, is very light in this age of ours, unless the\ncontempt it has of works makes it disdain their company.  So it is, that\nto this very purpose the Sire de Joinville, as credible a witness as any\nother whatever, tells us of the Bedouins, a nation amongst the Saracens,\nwith whom the king St. Louis had to do in the Holy Land, that they, in\ntheir religion, so firmly believed the number of every man\u2019s days to be\nfrom all eternity prefixed and set down by an inevitable decree, that\nthey went naked to the wars, excepting a Turkish sword, and their bodies\nonly covered with a white linen cloth: and for the greatest curse they\ncould invent when they were angry, this was always in their mouths:\n\u201cAccursed be thou, as he that arms himself for fear of death.\u201d  This is a\ntestimony of faith very much beyond ours.  And of this sort is that also\nthat two friars of Florence gave in our fathers\u2019 days.  Being engaged in\nsome controversy of learning, they agreed to go both of them into the\nfire in the sight of all the people, each for the verification of his\nargument, and all things were already prepared, and the thing just upon\nthe point of execution, when it was interrupted by an unexpected\naccident.--[7th April 1498.  Savonarola issued the challenge.  After many\ndelays from demands and counter-demands by each side as to the details of\nthe fire, both parties found that they had important business to transact\nin another county--both just barely escaped assassination at the hands of\nthe disappointed spectators.  D.W.]\n\nA young Turkish lord, having performed a notable exploit in his own\nperson in the sight of both armies, that of Amurath and that of Huniades,\nready to join battle, being asked by Amurath, what in such tender and\ninexperienced years (for it was his first sally into arms) had inspired\nhim with so brave a courage, replied, that his chief tutor for valour was\na hare.  \u201cFor being,\u201d said he, \u201cone day a hunting, I found a hare\nsitting, and though I had a brace of excellent greyhounds with me, yet\nmethought it would be best for sureness to make use of my bow; for she\nsat very fair.  I then fell to letting fly my arrows, and shot forty that\nI had in my quiver, not only without hurting, but without starting her\nfrom her form.  At last I slipped my dogs after her, but to no more\npurpose than I had shot: by which I understood that she had been secured\nby her destiny; and, that neither darts nor swords can wound without the\npermission of fate, which we can neither hasten nor defer.\u201d  This story\nmay serve, by the way, to let us see how flexible our reason is to all\nsorts of images.\n\nA person of great years, name, dignity, and learning boasted to me that\nhe had been induced to a certain very important change in his faith by a\nstrange and whimsical incitation, and one otherwise so inadequate, that I\nthought it much stronger, taken the contrary way: he called it a miracle,\nand so I look upon it, but in a different sense.  The Turkish historians\nsay, that the persuasion those of their nation have imprinted in them of\nthe fatal and unalterable prescription of their days, manifestly conduces\nto the giving them great assurance in dangers.  And I know a great prince\nwho makes very fortunate use of it, whether it be that he really believes\nit, or that he makes it his excuse for so wonderfully hazarding himself:\nlet us hope Fortune may not be too soon weary of her favour to him.\n\nThere has not happened in our memory a more admirable effect of\nresolution than in those two who conspired the death of the Prince of\nOrange.\n\n     [The first of these was Jehan de Jaureguy, who wounded the Prince\n     18th March 1582; the second, by whom the Prince was killed 10th July\n     1584., was Balthazar Gerard.]\n\n\u2018Tis marvellous how the second who executed it, could ever be persuaded\ninto an attempt, wherein his companion, who had done his utmost, had had\nso ill success; and after the same method, and with the same arms, to go\nattack a lord, armed with so recent a late lesson of distrust, powerful\nin followers and bodily strength, in his own hall, amidst his guards, and\nin a city wholly at his devotion.  Assuredly, he employed a very resolute\narm and a courage enflamed with furious passion.  A poignard is surer for\nstriking home; but by reason that more motion and force of hand is\nrequired than with a pistol, the blow is more subject to be put by or\nhindered.  That this man did not run to a certain death, I make no great\ndoubt; for the hopes any one could flatter him withal, could not find\nplace in any sober understanding, and the conduct of his exploit\nsufficiently manifests that he had no want of that, no more than of\ncourage.  The motives of so powerful a persuasion may be diverse, for our\nfancy does what it will, both with itself and us.  The execution that was\ndone near Orleans--[The murder of the Duke of Guise by Poltrot.]--was\nnothing like this; there was in this more of chance than vigour; the\nwound was not mortal, if fortune had not made it so, and to attempt to\nshoot on horseback, and at a great distance, by one whose body was in\nmotion from the motion of his horse, was the attempt of a man who had\nrather miss his blow than fail of saving himself.  This was apparent from\nwhat followed; for he was so astonished and stupefied with the thought of\nso high an execution, that he totally lost his judgment both to find his\nway to flight and to govern his tongue.  What needed he to have done more\nthan to fly back to his friends across the river?  \u2018Tis what I have done\nin less dangers, and that I think of very little hazard, how broad soever\nthe river may be, provided your horse have easy going in, and that you\nsee on the other side easy landing according to the stream.  The other,\n--[Balthazar Gerard.]--when they pronounced his dreadful sentence,\n\u201cI was prepared for this,\u201d said he, \u201cbeforehand, and I will make you\nwonder at my patience.\u201d\n\nThe Assassins, a nation bordering upon Phoenicia,\n\n     [Or in Egypt, Syria, and Persia.  Derivation of \u2018assassin\u2019 is from\n     Hassan-ben-Saba, one of their early leaders, and they had an\n     existence for some centuries.  They are classed among the secret\n     societies of the Middle Ages.  D.W.]\n\nare reputed amongst the Mohammedans a people of very great devotion and\npurity of manners.  They hold that the nearest way to gain Paradise is to\nkill some one of a contrary religion; which is the reason they have often\nbeen seen, being but one or two, and without armour, to attempt against\npowerful enemies, at the price of a certain death and without any\nconsideration of their own danger.  So was our Raymond, Count of Tripoli,\nassassinated (which word is derived from their name) in the heart of his\ncity,--[in 1151]--during our enterprises of the Holy War: and likewise\nConrad, Marquis of Monteferrat, the murderers at their execution bearing\nthemselves with great pride and glory that they had performed so brave an\nexploit.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX.\n\nOF A MONSTROUS CHILD\n\nThis story shall go by itself; for I will leave it to physicians to\ndiscourse of.  Two days ago I saw a child that two men and a nurse, who\nsaid they were the father, the uncle, and the aunt of it, carried about\nto get money by showing it, by reason it was so strange a creature.  It\nwas, as to all the rest, of a common form, and could stand upon its feet;\ncould go and gabble much like other children of the same age; it had\nnever as yet taken any other nourishment but from the nurse\u2019s breasts,\nand what, in my presence, they tried to put into the mouth of it, it only\nchewed a little and spat it out again without swallowing; the cry of it\nseemed indeed a little odd and particular, and it was just fourteen\nmonths old.  Under the breast it was joined to another child, but without\na head, and which had the spine of the back without motion, the rest\nentire; for though it had one arm shorter than the other, it had been\nbroken by accident at their birth; they were joined breast to breast, and\nas if a lesser child sought to throw its arms about the neck of one\nsomething bigger.  The juncture and thickness of the place where they\nwere conjoined was not above four fingers, or thereabouts, so that if you\nthrust up the imperfect child you might see the navel of the other below\nit, and the joining was betwixt the paps and the navel.  The navel of the\nimperfect child could not be seen, but all the rest of the belly, so that\nall that was not joined of the imperfect one, as arms, buttocks, thighs,\nand legs, hung dangling upon the other, and might reach to the mid-leg.\nThe nurse, moreover, told us that it urined at both bodies, and that the\nmembers of the other were nourished, sensible, and in the same plight\nwith that she gave suck to, excepting that they were shorter and less.\nThis double body and several limbs relating to one head might be\ninterpreted a favourable prognostic to the king,--[Henry III.]--of\nmaintaining these various parts of our state under the union of his laws;\nbut lest the event should prove otherwise, \u2018tis better to let it alone,\nfor in things already past there needs no divination,\n\n          \u201cUt quum facts sunt, tum ad conjecturam\n          aliqui interpretatione revocentur;\u201d\n\n     [\u201cSo as when they are come to pass, they may then by some\n     interpretation be recalled to conjecture\u201d\n      --Cicero, De Divin., ii. 31.]\n\nas \u2018tis said of Epimenides, that he always prophesied backward.\n\nI have just seen a herdsman in Medoc, of about thirty years of age, who\nhas no sign of any genital parts; he has three holes by which he\nincessantly voids his water; he is bearded, has desire, and seeks contact\nwith women.\n\nThose that we call monsters are not so to God, who sees in the immensity\nof His work the infinite forms that He has comprehended therein; and it\nis to be believed that this figure which astonishes us has relation to\nsome other figure of the same kind unknown to man.  From His all wisdom\nnothing but good, common; and regular proceeds; but we do not discern the\ndisposition and relation:\n\n          \u201cQuod crebro videt, non miratur, etiamsi,\n          cur fiat, nescit.  Quod ante non vidit, id,\n          si evenerit, ostentum esse censet.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cWhat he often sees he does not admire, though he be ignorant how\n     it comes to pass.  When a thing happens he never saw before, he\n     thinks that it is a portent.\u201d--Cicero, De Divin., ii.  22.]\n\nWhatever falls out contrary to custom we say is contrary to nature, but\nnothing, whatever it be, is contrary to her.  Let, therefore, this\nuniversal and natural reason expel the error and astonishment that\nnovelty brings along with it.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI\n\nOF ANGER\n\nPlutarch is admirable throughout, but especially where he judges of human\nactions.  What fine things does he say in the comparison of Lycurgus and\nNuma upon the subject of our great folly in abandoning children to the\ncare and government of their fathers?  The most of our civil governments,\nas Aristotle says, \u201cleave, after the manner of the Cyclopes, to every one\nthe ordering of their wives and children, according to their own foolish\nand indiscreet fancy; and the Lacedaemonian and Cretan are almost the\nonly governments that have committed the education of children to the\nlaws.  Who does not see that in a state all depends upon their nurture\nand bringing up? and yet they are left to the mercy of parents, let them\nbe as foolish and ill-conditioned as they may, without any manner of\ndiscretion.\u201d\n\nAmongst other things, how often have I, as I have passed along our\nstreets, had a good mind to get up a farce, to revenge the poor boys whom\nI have seen hided, knocked down, and miserably beaten by some father or\nmother, when in their fury and mad with rage?  You shall see them come\nout with fire and fury sparkling in their eyes:\n\n              \u201cRabie jecur incendente, feruntur,\n               Praecipites; ut saxa jugis abrupta, quibus mons\n               Subtrahitur, clivoque latus pendente recedit,\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThey are headlong borne with burning fury as great stones torn\n     from the mountains, by which the steep sides are left naked and\n     bare.\u201d--Juvenal, Sat., vi. 647.]\n\n(and according to Hippocrates, the most dangerous maladies are they that\ndisfigure the countenance), with a roaring and terrible voice, very often\nagainst those that are but newly come from nurse, and there they are\nlamed and spoiled with blows, whilst our justice takes no cognisance of\nit, as if these maims and dislocations were not executed upon members of\nour commonwealth:\n\n         \u201cGratum est, quod patria; civem populoque dedisti,\n          Si facis, ut patrix sit idoneus, utilis agris,\n          Utilis et bellorum et pacis rebus agendis.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cIt is well when to thy country and the people thou hast given a\n     citizen, provided thou make fit for his country\u2019s service; useful to\n     till the earth, useful in affairs of war and peace\u201d\n      --Juvenal, Sat., xiv. 70.]\n\nThere is no passion that so much transports men from their right judgment\nas anger.  No one would demur upon punishing a judge with death who\nshould condemn a criminal on the account of his own choler; why, then,\nshould fathers and pedagogues be any more allowed to whip and chastise\nchildren in their anger?  \u2018Tis then no longer correction, but revenge.\nChastisement is instead of physic to children; and would we endure a\nphysician who should be animated against and enraged at his patient?\n\nWe ourselves, to do well, should never lay a hand upon our servants\nwhilst our anger lasts.  When the pulse beats, and we feel emotion in\nourselves, let us defer the business; things will indeed appear otherwise\nto us when we are calm and cool.  \u2018Tis passion that then commands, \u2018tis\npassion that speaks, and not we.  Faults seen through passion appear much\ngreater to us than they really are, as bodies do when seen through a\nmist.  He who is hungry uses meat; but he who will make use of\nchastisement should have neither hunger nor thirst to it.  And, moreover,\nchastisements that are inflicted with weight and discretion are much\nbetter received and with greater benefit by him who suffers; otherwise,\nhe will not think himself justly condemned by a man transported with\nanger and fury, and will allege his master\u2019s excessive passion, his\ninflamed countenance, his unwonted oaths, his emotion and precipitous\nrashness, for his own justification:\n\n              \u201cOra tument ira, nigrescunt sanguine venae,\n               Lumina Gorgoneo saevius igne micant.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cTheir faces swell, their veins grow black with rage, and their\n     eyes sparkle with Gorgonian fire.\u201d--Ovid, De Art. Amandi, iii. 503.]\n\nSuetonius reports that Caius Rabirius having been condemned by Caesar,\nthe thing that most prevailed upon the people (to whom he had appealed)\nto determine the cause in his favour, was the animosity and vehemence\nthat Caesar had manifested in that sentence.\n\nSaying is a different thing from doing; we are to consider the sermon\napart and the preacher apart.  These men lent themselves to a pretty\nbusiness who in our times have attempted to shake the truth of our Church\nby the vices of her ministers; she extracts her testimony elsewhere; \u2018tis\na foolish way of arguing and that would throw all things into confusion.\nA man whose morals are good may have false opinions, and a wicked man may\npreach truth, even though he believe it not himself.  \u2018Tis doubtless a\nfine harmony when doing and saying go together; and I will not deny but\nthat saying, when the actions follow, is not of greater authority and\nefficacy, as Eudamidas said, hearing a philosopher talk of military\naffairs: \u201cThese things are finely said, but he who speaks them is not to\nbe believed for his ears have never been used to the sound of the\ntrumpet.\u201d  And Cleomenes, hearing an orator declaiming upon valour, burst\nout into laughter, at which the other being angry; \u201cI should,\u201d said he to\nhim, \u201cdo the same if it were a swallow that spoke of this subject; but if\nit were an eagle I should willingly hear him.\u201d  I perceive, methinks, in\nthe writings of the ancients, that he who speaks what he thinks, strikes\nmuch more home than he who only feigns.  Hear Cicero speak of the love of\nliberty: hear Brutus speak of it, the mere written words of this man\nsound as if he would purchase it at the price of his life.  Let Cicero,\nthe father of eloquence, treat of the contempt of death; let Seneca do\nthe same: the first languishingly drawls it out so you perceive he would\nmake you resolve upon a thing on which he is not resolved himself; he\ninspires you not with courage, for he himself has none; the other\nanimates and inflames you.  I never read an author, even of those who\ntreat of virtue and of actions, that I do not curiously inquire what kind\nof a man he was himself; for the Ephori at Sparta, seeing a dissolute\nfellow propose a wholesome advice to the people, commanded him to hold\nhis peace, and entreated a virtuous man to attribute to himself the\ninvention, and to propose it.  Plutarch\u2019s writings, if well understood,\nsufficiently bespeak their author, and so that I think I know him even\ninto his soul; and yet I could wish that we had some fuller account of\nhis life.  And I am thus far wandered from my subject, upon the account\nof the obligation I have to Aulus Gellius, for having left us in writing\nthis story of his manners, that brings me back to my subject of anger.\nA slave of his, a vicious, ill-conditioned fellow, but who had the\nprecepts of philosophy often ringing in his ears, having for some offence\nof his been stript by Plutarch\u2019s command, whilst he was being whipped,\nmuttered at first, that it was without cause and that he had done nothing\nto deserve it; but at last falling in good earnest to exclaim against and\nrail at his master, he reproached him that he was no philosopher, as he\nhad boasted himself to be: that he had often heard him say it was\nindecent to be angry, nay, had written a book to that purpose; and that\nthe causing him to be so cruelly beaten, in the height of his rage,\ntotally gave the lie to all his writings; to which Plutarch calmly and\ncoldly answered, \u201cHow, ruffian,\u201d said he, \u201cby what dost thou judge that\nI am now angry?  Does either my face, my colour, or my voice give any\nmanifestation of my being moved?  I do not think my eyes look fierce,\nthat my countenance appears troubled, or that my voice is dreadful: am I\nred, do I foam, does any word escape my lips I ought to repent?  Do I\nstart?  Do I tremble with fury?  For those, I tell thee, are the true\nsigns of anger.\u201d  And so, turning to the fellow that was whipping him,\n\u201cPly on thy work,\u201d said he, \u201cwhilst this gentleman and I dispute.\u201d  This\nis his story.\n\nArchytas Tarentinus, returning from a war wherein he had been\ncaptain-general, found all things in his house in very great disorder,\nand his lands quite out of tillage, through the ill husbandry of his\nreceiver, and having caused him to be called to him; \u201cGo,\u201d said he, \u201cif I\nwere not in anger I would soundly drub your sides.\u201d  Plato likewise,\nbeing highly offended with one of his slaves, gave Speusippus order to\nchastise him, excusing himself from doing it because he was in anger.\nAnd Carillus, a Lacedaemonian, to a Helot, who carried himself insolently\ntowards him: \u201cBy the gods,\u201d said he, \u201cif I was not angry, I would\nimmediately cause thee to be put to death.\u201d\n\n\u2018Tis a passion that is pleased with and flatters itself.  How often,\nbeing moved under a false cause, if the person offending makes a good\ndefence and presents us with a just excuse, are we angry against truth\nand innocence itself?  In proof of which, I remember a marvellous example\nof antiquity.\n\nPiso, otherwise a man of very eminent virtue, being moved against a\nsoldier of his, for that returning alone from forage he could give him no\naccount where he had left a companion of his, took it for granted that he\nhad killed him, and presently condemned him to death.  He was no sooner\nmounted upon the gibbet, but, behold, his wandering companion arrives, at\nwhich all the army were exceedingly glad, and after many embraces of the\ntwo comrades, the hangman carried both the one and the other into Piso\u2019s\npresence, all those present believing it would be a great pleasure even\nto himself; but it proved quite contrary; for through shame and spite,\nhis fury, which was not yet cool, redoubled; and by a subtlety which his\npassion suddenly suggested to him, he made three criminals for having\nfound one innocent, and caused them all to be despatched: the first\nsoldier, because sentence had passed upon him; the second, who had lost\nhis way, because he was the cause of his companion\u2019s death; and the\nhangman, for not having obeyed the order which had been given him.\nSuch as have had to do with testy and obstinate women, may have\nexperimented into what a rage it puts them to oppose silence and coldness\nto their fury, and that a man disdains to nourish their anger.  The\norator Celius was wonderfully choleric by nature; and to one who supped\nin his company, a man of a gentle and sweet conversation, and who, that\nhe might not move him, approved and consented to all he said; he,\nimpatient that his ill-humour should thus spend itself without aliment:\n\u201cFor the love of the gods deny me something,\u201d said he, \u201cthat we may be\ntwo.\u201d  Women, in like manner, are only angry that others may be angry\nagain, in imitation of the laws of love.  Phocion, to one who interrupted\nhis speaking by injurious and very opprobrious words, made no other\nreturn than silence, and to give him full liberty and leisure to vent his\nspleen; which he having accordingly done, and the storm blown over,\nwithout any mention of this disturbance, he proceeded in his discourse\nwhere he had left off before.  No answer can nettle a man like such a\ncontempt.\n\nOf the most choleric man in France (anger is always an imperfection, but\nmore excusable in, a soldier, for in that trade it cannot sometimes be\navoided) I often say, that he is the most patient man that I know, and\nthe most discreet in bridling his passions; which rise in him with so\ngreat violence and fury,\n\n                    \u201cMagno veluti cum flamma sonore\n          Virgea suggeritur costis undantis ahem,\n          Exsultantque aatu latices, furit intus aquae vis.\n          Fumidus atque alte spumis exuberat amnis,\n          Nec jam se capit unda; volat vapor ater ad auras;\u201d\n\n     [\u201cWhen with loud crackling noise, a fire of sticks is applied to the\n     boiling caldron\u2019s side, by the heat in frisky bells the liquor\n     dances; within the water rages, and high the smoky fluid in foam\n     overflows.  Nor can the wave now contain itself; the black steam\n     flies all abroad.\u201d--AEneid, vii. 462.]\n\n\nthat he must of necessity cruelly constrain himself to moderate it.  And\nfor my part, I know no passion which I could with so much violence to\nmyself attempt to cover and conceal; I would not set wisdom at so high a\nprice; and do not so much consider what a man does, as how much it costs\nhim to do no worse.\n\nAnother boasted himself to me of the regularity and gentleness of his\nmanners, which are to truth very singular; to whom I replied, that it was\nindeed something, especially m persons of so eminent a quality as\nhimself, upon whom every one had their eyes, to present himself always\nwell-tempered to the world; but that the principal thing was to make\nprovision for within and for himself; and that it was not in my opinion\nvery well to order his business outwardly well, and to grate himself\nwithin, which I was afraid he did, in putting on and maintaining this\nmask and external appearance.\n\nA man incorporates anger by concealing it, as Diogenes told Demosthenes,\nwho, for fear of being seen in a tavern, withdrew himself the more\nretiredly into it: \u201cThe more you retire backward, the farther you enter\nin.\u201d  I would rather advise that a man should give his servant a box of\nthe ear a little unseasonably, than rack his fancy to present this grave\nand composed countenance; and had rather discover my passions than brood\nover them at my own expense; they grow less inventing and manifesting\nthemselves; and \u2018tis much better their point should wound others without,\nthan be turned towards ourselves within:\n\n     \u201cOmnia vitia in aperto leviora sunt: et tunc perniciosissima,\n     quum simulata sanitate subsident.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cAll vices are less dangerous when open to be seen, and then most\n     pernicious when they lurk under a dissembled good nature.\u201d\n      --Seneca, Ep. 56]\n\nI admonish all those who have authority to be angry in my family, in the\nfirst place to manage their anger and not to lavish it upon every\noccasion, for that both lessens the value and hinders the effect: rash\nand incessant scolding runs into custom, and renders itself despised; and\nwhat you lay out upon a servant for a theft is not felt, because it is\nthe same he has seen you a hundred times employ against him for having\nill washed a glass, or set a stool out of place.  Secondly, that they be\nnot angry to no purpose, but make sure that their reprehension reach him\nwith whom they are offended; for, ordinarily, they rail and bawl before\nhe comes into their presence, and continue scolding an age after he is\ngone:\n\n               \u201cEt secum petulans amentia certat:\u201d\n\n          [\u201cAnd petulant madness contends with itself.\u201d\n           --Claudian in Eutrop., i. 237.]\n\nthey attack his shadow, and drive the storm in a place where no one is\neither chastised or concerned, but in the clamour of their voice.\nI likewise in quarrels condemn those who huff and vapour without an\nenemy: those rhodomontades should be reserved to discharge upon the\noffending party:\n\n         \u201cMugitus veluti cum prima in praelia taurus\n          Terrificos ciet, atque irasci in cornua tentat,\n          Arboris obnixus trunco, ventospue lacessit\n          Ictibus, et sparsa ad pugnum proludit arena.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cAs when a bull to usher in the fight, makes dreadful bellowings,\n     and whets his horns against the trunk of a tree; with blows he beats\n     the air, and rehearses the fight by scattering the sand.\u201d\n      --AEneid, xii. 103.]\n\nWhen I am angry, my anger is very sharp but withal very short, and as\nprivate as I can; I lose myself indeed in promptness and violence, but\nnot in trouble; so that I throw out all sorts of injurious words at\nrandom, and without choice, and never consider pertinently to dart my\nlanguage where I think it will deepest wound, for I commonly make use of\nno other weapon than my tongue.\n\nMy servants have a better bargain of me in great occasions than in\nlittle; the little ones surprise me; and the misfortune is, that when you\nare once upon the precipice, \u2018tis no matter who gave you the push, you\nalways go to the bottom; the fall urges, moves, and makes haste of\nitself.  In great occasions this satisfies me, that they are so just\nevery one expects a reasonable indignation, and then I glorify myself in\ndeceiving their expectation; against these, I fortify and prepare myself;\nthey disturb my head, and threaten to transport me very far, should I\nfollow them.  I can easily contain myself from entering into one of these\npassions, and am strong enough, when I expect them, to repel their\nviolence, be the cause never so great; but if a passion once prepossess\nand seize me, it carries me away, be the cause never so small.  I bargain\nthus with those who may contend with me when you see me moved first, let\nme alone, right or wrong; I\u2019ll do the same for you.  The storm is only\nbegot by a concurrence of angers, which easily spring from one another,\nand are not born together.  Let every one have his own way, and we shall\nbe always at peace.  A profitable advice, but hard to execute.  Sometimes\nalso it falls out that I put on a seeming anger, for the better governing\nof my house, without any real emotion.  As age renders my humours more\nsharp, I study to oppose them, and will, if I can, order it so, that for\nthe future I may be so much the less peevish and hard to please, as I\nhave more excuse and inclination to be so, although I have heretofore\nbeen reckoned amongst those who have the greatest patience.\n\nA word more to conclude this argument.  Aristotle says, that anger\nsometimes serves for arms to virtue and valour.  That is probable;\nnevertheless, they who contradict him  pleasantly answer, that \u2018tis a\nweapon of novel use, for we move all other arms, this moves us; our hand\nguides it not, \u2018tis it that guides our hand; it holds us, we hold not it.\n\n\n\n\n     ETEXT EDITOR\u2019S BOOKMARKS:\n\n     A man may always study, but he must not always go to school\n     Accursed be thou, as he that arms himself for fear of death\n     All things have their seasons, even good ones\n     All those who have authority to be angry in my family\n     \u201cAn emperor,\u201d said he, \u201cmust die standing\u201d\n      Ancient Romans kept their youth always standing at school\n     And we suffer the ills of a long peace\n     Be not angry to no purpose\n     Best virtue I have has in it some tincture of vice\n     By resenting the lie we acquit ourselves of the fault\n     \u201cBy the gods,\u201d said he, \u201cif I was not angry, I would execute you\u201d\n      Children are amused with toys and men with words\n     Consent, and complacency in giving a man\u2019s self up to melancholy\n     Defend most the defects with which we are most tainted\n     Emperor Julian, surnamed the Apostate\n     Fortune sometimes seems to delight in taking us at our word\n     Greatest talkers, for the most part, do nothing to purpose\n     Have more wherewith to defray my journey, than I have way to go\n     Hearing a philosopher talk of military affairs\n     How much it costs him to do no worse\n     I need not seek a fool from afar; I can laugh at myself\n     Idleness, the mother of corruption\n     If a passion once prepossess and seize me, it carries me away\n     In sorrow there is some mixture of pleasure\n     Killing is good to frustrate an offence to come, not to revenge\n     Laws cannot subsist without mixture of injustice\n     Least end of a hair will serve to draw them into my discourse\n     Let us not seek our disease out of ourselves; \u2018tis in us\n     Look on death not only without astonishment but without care\n     Melancholy: Are there not some constitutions that feed upon it?\n     Most cruel people, and upon frivolous occasions, apt to cry.\n     No beast in the world so much to be feared by man as man\n     Our extremest pleasure has some sort of groaning\n     Our fancy does what it will, both with itself and us\n     Owe ourselves chiefly and mostly to ourselves\n     Petulant madness contends with itself\n     Rage it puts them to oppose silence and coldness to their fury\n     Rash and incessant scolding runs into custom\n     Revenge, which afterwards produces a series of new cruelties\n     See how flexible our reason is\n     Seeming anger, for the better governing of my house\n     Shake the truth of our Church by the vices of her ministers\n     Take my last leave of every place I depart from\n     The gods sell us all the goods they give us\n     The storm is only begot by a concurrence of angers\n     Though nobody should read me, have I wasted time\n     Tis said of Epimenides, that he always prophesied backward\n     Tis then no longer correction, but revenge\n     Upon the precipice, \u2018tis no matter who gave you the push\n     \u201cWhen will this man be wise,\u201d said he, \u201cif he is yet learning?\u201d\n      When you see me moved first, let me alone, right or wrong\n     Young are to make their preparations, the old to enjoy them\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nESSAYS OF MICHEL DE MONTAIGNE\n\nTranslated by Charles Cotton\n\nEdited by William Carew Hazlitt\n\n1877\n\n\n\n\nCONTENTS OF VOLUME 13.\n\nXXXII.

Wherein, in my\nopinion, he does the said cardinal a very great honour; for though I am\none of those who have a very high esteem for his wit, eloquence, and zeal\nto religion and the service of his king, and his good fortune to have\nlived in an age wherein it was so novel, so rare, and also so necessary\nfor the public good to have an ecclesiastical person of such high birth\nand dignity, and so sufficient and capable of his place; yet, to confess\nthe truth, I do not think his capacity by many degrees near to the other,\nnor his virtue either so clean, entire, or steady as that of Seneca.\n\nNow the book whereof I speak, to bring about its design, gives a very\ninjurious description of Seneca, having borrowed its approaches from Dion\nthe historian, whose testimony I do not at all believe for besides that\nhe is inconsistent, that after having called Seneca one while very wise,\nand again a mortal enemy to Nero\u2019s vices, makes him elsewhere avaricious,\nan usurer, ambitious, effeminate, voluptuous, and a false pretender to\nphilosophy, his virtue appears so vivid and vigorous in his writings, and\nhis vindication is so clear from any of these imputations, as of his\nriches and extraordinarily expensive way of living, that I cannot believe\nany testimony to the contrary.  And besides, it is much more reasonable\nto believe the Roman historians in such things than Greeks and\nforeigners.  Now Tacitus and the rest speak very honourably both of his\nlife and death; and represent him to us a very excellent and virtuous\nperson in all things; and I will allege no other reproach against Dion\u2019s\nreport but this, which I cannot avoid, namely, that he has so weak a\njudgment in the Roman affairs, that he dares to maintain Julius Caesar\u2019s\ncause against Pompey [And so does this editor.  D.W.], and that of Antony\nagainst Cicero.\n\nLet us now come to Plutarch: Jean Bodin is a good author of our times,\nand a writer of much greater judgment than the rout of scribblers of his\nage, and who deserves to be read and considered.  I find him, though, a\nlittle bold in this passage of his Method of history, where he accuses\nPlutarch not only of ignorance (wherein I would have let him alone: for\nthat is beyond my criticism), but that he \u201coften writes things\nincredible, and absolutely fabulous \u201c: these are his own words.  If he\nhad simply said, that he had delivered things otherwise than they really\nare, it had been no great reproach; for what we have not seen, we are\nforced to receive from other hands, and take upon trust, and I see that\nhe purposely sometimes variously relates the same story; as the judgment\nof the three best captains that ever were, given by Hannibal; \u2018tis one\nway in the Life of Flammius, and another in that of Pyrrhus.  But to\ncharge him with having taken incredible and impossible things for current\npay, is to accuse the most judicious author in the world of want of\njudgment.  And this is his example; \u201cas,\u201d says he, \u201cwhen he relates that\na Lacedaemonian boy suffered his bowels to be torn out by a fox-cub he\nhad stolen, and kept it still concealed under his coat till he fell down\ndead, rather than he would discover his theft.\u201d  I find, in the first\nplace, this example ill chosen, forasmuch as it is very hard to limit the\npower of the faculties of--the soul, whereas we have better authority to\nlimit and know the force of the bodily limbs; and therefore, if I had\nbeen he, I should rather have chosen an example of this second sort; and\nthere are some of these less credible: and amongst others, that which he\nrefates of Pyrrhus, that \u201call wounded as he was, he struck one of his\nenemies, who was armed from head to foot, so great a blow with his sword,\nthat he clave him down from his crown to his seat, so that the body was\ndivided into two parts.\u201d  In this example I find no great miracle, nor do\nI admit the excuse with which he defends Plutarch, in having added these\nwords, \u201cas \u2018tis said,\u201d to suspend our belief; for unless it be in things\nreceived by authority, and the reverence to antiquity or religion, he\nwould never have himself admitted, or enjoined us to believe things\nincredible in themselves; and that these words, \u201cas \u2018tis said,\u201d are not\nput in this place to that effect, is easy to be seen, because he\nelsewhere relates to us, upon this subject, of the patience of the\nLacedaemonian children, examples happening in his time, more unlikely to\nprevail upon our faith; as what Cicero has also testified before him, as\nhaving, as he says, been upon the spot: that even to their times there\nwere children found who, in the trial of patience they were put to before\nthe altar of Diana, suffered themselves to be there whipped till the\nblood ran down all over their bodies, not only without crying out, but\nwithout so much as a groan, and some till they there voluntarily lost\ntheir lives: and that which Plutarch also, amongst a hundred other\nwitnesses, relates, that at a sacrifice, a burning coal having fallen\ninto the sleeve of a Lacedaemonian boy, as he was censing, he suffered\nhis whole arm to be burned, till the smell of the broiling flesh was\nperceived by those present.  There was nothing, according to their\ncustom, wherein their reputation was more concerned, nor for which they\nwere to undergo more blame and disgrace, than in being taken in theft.\nI am so fully satisfied of the greatness of those people, that this story\ndoes not only not appear to me, as to Bodin, incredible; but I do not\nfind it so much as rare and strange.  The Spartan history is full of a\nthousand more cruel and rare examples; and is; indeed, all miracle in\nthis respect.\n\nMarcellinus, concerning theft, reports that in his time there was no sort\nof torments which could compel the Egyptians, when taken in this act,\nthough a people very much addicted to it, so much as to tell their name.\n\nA Spanish peasant, being put to the rack as to the accomplices of the\nmurder of the Praetor Lucius Piso, cried out in the height of the\ntorment, \u201cthat his friends should not leave him, but look on in all\nassurance, and that no pain had the power to force from him one word of\nconfession,\u201d which was all they could get the first day.  The next day,\nas they were leading him a second time to another trial, strongly\ndisengaging himself from the hands of his guards, he furiously ran his\nhead against a wall, and beat out his brains.\n\nEpicharis, having tired and glutted the cruelty of Nero\u2019s satellites, and\nundergone their fire, their beating, their racks, a whole day together,\nwithout one syllable of confession of her conspiracy; being the next day\nbrought again to the rack, with her limbs almost torn to pieces, conveyed\nthe lace of her robe with a running noose over one of the arms of her\nchair, and suddenly slipping her head into it, with the weight of her own\nbody hanged herself.  Having the courage to die in that manner, is it not\nto be presumed that she purposely lent her life to the trial of her\nfortitude the day before, to mock the tyrant, and encourage others to the\nlike attempt?\n\nAnd whoever will inquire of our troopers the experiences they have had in\nour civil wars, will find effects of patience and obstinate resolution in\nthis miserable age of ours, and amongst this rabble even more effeminate\nthan the Egyptians, worthy to be compared with those we have just related\nof the Spartan virtue.\n\nI know there have been simple peasants amongst us who have endured the\nsoles of their feet to be broiled upon a gridiron, their finger-ends to\nbe crushed with the cock of a pistol, and their bloody eyes squeezed out\nof their heads by force of a cord twisted about their brows, before they\nwould so much as consent to a ransom.  I have seen one left stark naked\nfor dead in a ditch, his neck black and swollen, with a halter yet about\nit with which they had dragged him all night at a horse\u2019s tail, his body\nwounded in a hundred places, with stabs of daggers that had been given\nhim, not to kill him, but to put him to pain and to affright him, who had\nendured all this, and even to being speechless and insensible, resolved,\nas he himself told me, rather to die a thousand deaths (as indeed, as to\nmatter of suffering, he had borne one) before he would promise anything;\nand yet he was one of the richest husbandmen of all the country.  How\nmany have been seen patiently to suffer themselves to be burnt and\nroasted for opinions taken upon trust from others, and by them not at all\nunderstood?  I have known a hundred and a hundred women (for Gascony has\na certain prerogative for obstinacy) whom you might sooner have made eat\nfire than forsake an opinion they had conceived in anger.  They are all\nthe more exasperated by blows and constraint.  And he that made the story\nof the woman who, in defiance of all correction, threats, and\nbastinadoes, ceased not to call her husband lousy knave, and who being\nplunged over head and ears in water, yet lifted her hands above her head\nand made a sign of cracking lice, feigned a tale of which, in truth, we\nevery day see a manifest image in the obstinacy of women.  And obstinacy\nis the sister of constancy, at least in vigour and stability.\n\nWe are not to judge what is possible and what is not, according to what\nis credible and incredible to our apprehension, as I have said elsewhere\nand it is a great fault, and yet one that most men are guilty of, which,\nnevertheless, I do not mention with any reflection upon Bodin, to make a\ndifficulty of believing that in another which they could not or would not\ndo themselves.  Every one thinks that the sovereign stamp of human nature\nis imprinted in him, and that from it all others must take their rule;\nand that all proceedings which are not like his are feigned and false.\nIs anything of another\u2019s actions or faculties proposed to him? the first\nthing he calls to the consultation of his judgment is his own example;\nand as matters go with him, so they must of necessity do with all the\nworld besides dangerous and intolerable folly!  For my part, I consider\nsome men as infinitely beyond me, especially amongst the ancients, and\nyet, though I clearly discern my inability to come near them by a\nthousand paces, I do not forbear to keep them in sight, and to judge of\nwhat so elevates them, of which I perceive some seeds in myself, as I\nalso do of the extreme meanness of some other minds, which I neither am\nastonished at nor yet misbelieve.  I  very well perceive the turns those\ngreat souls take to raise  themselves to such a pitch, and admire their\ngrandeur; and those flights that I think the bravest I could be glad to\nimitate; where, though I want wing, yet my judgment readily goes along\nwith them.  The other example he introduces of \u201cthings incredible and\nwholly fabulous,\u201d delivered by Plutarch, is, that \u201cAgesilaus was fined by\nthe Ephori for having wholly engrossed the hearts and affections of his\ncitizens to himself alone.\u201d  And herein I do not see what sign of falsity\nis to be found: clearly Plutarch speaks of things that must needs be\nbetter known to him than to us; and it was no new thing in Greece to see\nmen punished and exiled for this very thing, for being too acceptable to\nthe people; witness the Ostracism and Petalism.--[Ostracism at Athens\nwas banishment for ten years; petalism at Syracuse was banishment for\nfive years.]\n\nThere is yet in this place another accusation laid against Plutarch which\nI cannot well digest, where Bodin says that he has sincerely paralleled\nRomans with Romans, and Greeks amongst themselves, but not Romans with\nGreeks; witness, says he, Demosthenes and Cicero, Cato and Aristides,\nSylla and Lysander, Marcellus and Pelopidas, Pompey and Agesilaus,\nholding that he has favoured the Greeks in giving them so unequal\ncompanions.  This is really to attack what in Plutarch is most excellent\nand most to be commended; for in his parallels (which is the most\nadmirable part of all his works, and with which, in my opinion, he is\nhimself the most pleased) the fidelity and sincerity of his judgments\nequal their depth and weight; he is a philosopher who teaches us virtue.\nLet us see whether we cannot defend him from this reproach of falsity and\nprevarication.  All that I can imagine could give occasion to this\ncensure is the great and shining lustre of the Roman names which we have\nin our minds; it does not seem likely to us that Demosthenes could rival\nthe glory of a consul, proconsul, and proctor of that great Republic; but\nif a man consider the truth of the thing, and the men in themselves,\nwhich is Plutarch\u2019s chiefest aim, and will rather balance their manners,\ntheir natures, and parts, than their fortunes, I think, contrary to\nBodin, that Cicero and the elder Cato come far short of the men with whom\nthey are compared.  I should sooner, for his purpose, have chosen the\nexample of the younger Cato compared with Phocion, for in this couple\nthere would have been a more likely disparity, to the Roman\u2019s advantage.\nAs to Marcellus, Sylla, and Pompey, I very well discern that their\nexploits of war are greater and more full of pomp and glory than those of\nthe Greeks, whom Plutarch compares with them; but the bravest and most\nvirtuous actions any more in war than elsewhere, are not always the most\nrenowned.  I often see the names of captains obscured by the splendour of\nother names of less desert; witness Labienus, Ventidius, Telesinus, and\nseveral others.  And to take it by that, were I to complain on the behalf\nof the Greeks, could I not say, that Camillus was much less comparable to\nThemistocles, the Gracchi to Agis and Cleomenes, and Numa to Lycurgus?\nBut \u2018tis folly to judge, at one view, of things that have so many\naspects.  When Plutarch compares them, he does not, for all that, make\nthem equal; who could more learnedly and sincerely have marked their\ndistinctions?  Does he parallel the victories, feats of arms, the force\nof the armies conducted by Pompey, and his triumphs, with those of\nAgesilaus?  \u201cI do not believe,\u201d says he, \u201cthat Xenophon himself, if he\nwere now living, though he were allowed to write whatever pleased him to\nthe advantage of Agesilaus, would dare to bring them into comparison.\u201d\n Does he speak of paralleling Lysander to Sylla.  \u201cThere is,\u201d says he,\n\u201cno comparison, either in the number of victories or in the hazard of\nbattles, for Lysander only gained two naval battles.\u201d  This is not to\nderogate from the Romans; for having only simply named them with the\nGreeks, he can have done them no injury, what disparity soever there may\nbe betwixt them and Plutarch does not entirely oppose them to one\nanother; there is no preference in general; he only compares the pieces\nand circumstances one after another, and gives of every one a particular\nand separate judgment.  Wherefore, if any one could convict him of\npartiality, he ought to pick out some one of those particular judgments,\nor say, in general, that he was mistaken in comparing such a Greek to\nsuch a Roman, when there were others more fit and better resembling to\nparallel him to.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII\n\nTHE STORY OF SPURINA\n\nPhilosophy thinks she has not ill employed her talent when she has given\nthe sovereignty of the soul and the authority of restraining our\nappetites to reason.  Amongst which, they who judge that there is none\nmore violent than those which spring from love, have this opinion also,\nthat they seize both body and soul, and possess the whole man, so that\neven health itself depends upon them, and medicine is sometimes\nconstrained to pimp for them; but one might, on the contrary, also say,\nthat the mixture of the body brings an abatement and weakening; for such\ndesires are subject to satiety, and capable of material remedies.\n\nMany, being determined to rid their soul from the continual alarms of\nthis appetite, have made use of incision and amputation of the rebelling\nmembers; others have subdued their force and ardour by the frequent\napplication of cold things, as snow and vinegar.  The sackcloths of our\nancestors were for this purpose, which is cloth woven of horse hair, of\nwhich some of them made shirts, and others girdles, to torture and\ncorrect their reins.  A prince, not long ago, told me that in his youth\nupon a solemn festival in the court of King Francis I., where everybody\nwas finely dressed, he would needs put on his father\u2019s hair shirt, which\nwas still kept in the house; but how great soever his devotion was, he\nhad not patience to wear it till night, and was sick a long time after;\nadding withal, that he did not think there could be any youthful heat so\nfierce that the use of this recipe would not mortify, and yet perhaps he\nnever essayed the most violent; for experience shows us, that such\nemotions are often seen under rude and slovenly clothes, and that a hair\nshirt does not always render those chaste who wear it.\n\nXenocrates proceeded with greater rigour in this affair; for his\ndisciples, to make trial of his continency, having slipt Lais, that\nbeautiful and famous courtesan, into his bed, quite naked, excepting the\narms of her beauty and her wanton allurements, her philters, finding\nthat, in despite of his reason and philosophical rules, his unruly flesh\nbegan to mutiny, he caused those members of his to be burned that he\nfound consenting to this rebellion.  Whereas the passions which wholly\nreside in the soul, as ambition, avarice, and the rest, find the reason\nmuch more to do, because it cannot there be helped but by its own means;\nneither are those appetites capable of satiety, but grow sharper and\nincrease by fruition.\n\nThe sole example of Julius Caesar may suffice to demonstrate to us the\ndisparity of these appetites; for never was man more addicted to amorous\ndelights than he: of which one testimony is the peculiar care he had of\nhis person, to such a degree, as to make use of the most lascivious means\nto that end then in use, as to have all the hairs of his body twitched\noff, and to wipe all over with perfumes with the extremest nicety.\nAnd he was a beautiful person in himself, of a fair complexion, tall,\nand sprightly, full faced, with quick hazel eyes, if we may believe\nSuetonius; for the statues of him that we see at Rome do not in all\npoints answer this description.  Besides his wives, whom he four times\nchanged, without reckoning the amours of his boyhood with Nicomedes, king\nof Bithynia, he had the maidenhead of the renowned Cleopatra, queen of\nEgypt; witness the little Caesario whom he had by her.  He also made love\nto.  Eunoe, queen of Mauritania, and at Rome, to Posthumia, the wife of\nServius Sulpitius; to Lollia, the wife of Gabinius to Tertulla, the wife\nof Crassus, and even to Mutia, wife to the great Pompey: which was the\nreason, the Roman historians say, that she was repudiated by her husband,\nwhich Plutarch confesses to be more than he knew; and the Curios, both\nfather and son, afterwards reproached Pompey, when he married Caesar\u2019s\ndaughter, that he had made himself son-in-law to a man who had made him\ncuckold, and one whom he himself was wont to call AEgisthus.  Besides all\nthese, he entertained Servilia, Cato\u2019s sister and mother to Marcus\nBrutus, whence, every one believes, proceeded the great affection he had\nto Brutus, by reason that he was born at a time when it was likely he\nmight be his son.  So that I have reason, methinks, to take him for a man\nextremely given to this debauch, and of very amorous constitution.  But\nthe other passion of ambition, with which he was infinitely smitten,\narising in him to contend with the former, it was boon compelled to give\nway.\n\nAnd here calling to mind Mohammed, who won Constantinople, and finally\nexterminated the Grecian name, I do not know where these two were so\nevenly balanced; equally an indefatigable lecher and soldier: but where\nthey both meet in his life and jostle one another, the quarrelling\npassion always gets the better of the amorous one, and this though it was\nout of its natural season never regained an absolute sovereignty over the\nother till he had arrived at an extreme old age and unable to undergo the\nfatigues of war.\n\nWhat is related for a contrary example of Ladislaus, king of Naples, is\nvery remarkable; that being a great captain, valiant and ambitious, he\nproposed to himself for the principal end of his ambition, the execution\nof his pleasure and the enjoyment of some rare and excellent beauty.  His\ndeath sealed up all the rest: for having by a close and tedious siege\nreduced the city of Florence to so great distress that the inhabitants\nwere compelled to capitulate about surrender, he was content to let them\nalone, provided they would deliver up to him a beautiful maid he had\nheard of in their city; they were forced to yield to it, and by a private\ninjury to avert the public ruin.  She was the daughter of a famous\nphysician of his time, who, finding himself involved in so foul a\nnecessity, resolved upon a high attempt.  As every one was lending a hand\nto trick up his daughter and to adorn her with ornaments and jewels to\nrender her more agreeable to this new lover, he also gave her a\nhandkerchief most richly wrought, and of an exquisite perfume, an\nimplement they never go without in those parts, which she was to make use\nof at their first approaches.  This handkerchief, poisoned with his\ngreatest art, coming to be rubbed between the chafed flesh and open\npores, both of the one and the other, so suddenly infused the poison,\nthat immediately converting their warm into a cold sweat they presently\ndied in one another\u2019s arms.\n\nBut I return to Caesar.  His pleasures never made him steal one minute of\nan hour, nor go one step aside from occasions that might any way conduce\nto his advancement.  This passion was so sovereign in him over all the\nrest, and with so absolute authority possessed his soul, that it guided\nhim at pleasure.  In truth, this troubles me, when, as to everything\nelse, I consider the greatness of this man, and the wonderful parts\nwherewith he was endued; learned to that degree in all sorts of knowledge\nthat there is hardly any one science of which he has not written; so\ngreat an orator that many have preferred his eloquence to that of Cicero,\nand he, I conceive, did not think himself inferior to him in that\nparticular, for his two anti-Catos were written to counterbalance the\nelocution that Cicero had expended in his Cato.  As to the rest, was ever\nsoul so vigilant, so active, and so patient of labour as his? and,\ndoubtless, it was embellished with many rare seeds of virtue, lively,\nnatural, and not put on; he was singularly sober; so far from being\ndelicate in his diet, that Oppius relates, how that having one day at\ntable set before him medicated instead of common oil in some sauce, he\nate heartily of it, that he might not put his entertainer out of\ncountenance.  Another time he caused his baker to be whipped for serving\nhim with a finer than ordinary sort of bread.  Cato himself was wont to\nsay of him, that he was the first sober man who ever made it his business\nto ruin his country.  And as to the same Cato\u2019s calling, him one day\ndrunkard, it fell out thus being both of them in the Senate, at a time\nwhen Catiline\u2019s conspiracy was in question of which was Caesar was\nsuspected, one came and brought him a letter sealed up.  Cato believing\nthat it was something the conspirators gave him notice of, required him\nto deliver into his hand, which Caesar  was constrained to do to avoid\nfurther suspicion.  It was by chance a love-letter that Servilia, Cato\u2019s\nsister, had written to him, which Cato having read, he threw it back to\nhim saying, \u201cThere, drunkard.\u201d  This, I say, was rather a word of disdain\nand anger than an express reproach of this vice, as we often rate those\nwho anger us with the first injurious words that come into our mouths,\nthough nothing due to those we are offended at; to which may be added\nthat the vice with which Cato upbraided him is wonderfully near akin to\nthat wherein he had surprised Caesar; for Bacchus and Venus, according to\nthe proverb, very willingly agree; but to me Venus is much more sprightly\naccompanied by sobriety.  The examples of his sweetness and clemency to\nthose by whom he had been offended are infinite; I mean, besides those he\ngave during the time of the civil wars, which, as plainly enough appears\nby his writings, he practised to cajole his enemies, and to make them\nless afraid of his future dominion and victory.  But I must also say,\nthat if these examples are not sufficient proofs of his natural\nsweetness, they, at least, manifest a marvellous confidence and grandeur\nof courage in this person.  He has often been known to dismiss whole\narmies, after having overcome them, to his enemies, without ransom, or\ndeigning so much as to bind them by oath, if not to favour him, at least\nno more to bear arms against him; he has three or four times taken some\nof Pompey\u2019s captains prisoners, and as often set them at liberty.  Pompey\ndeclared all those to be enemies who did not follow him to the war; he\nproclaimed all those to be his friends who sat still and did not actually\ntake arms against him.  To such captains of his as ran away from him to\ngo over to the other side, he sent, moreover, their arms, horses, and\nequipage: the cities he had taken by force he left at full liberty to\nfollow which side they pleased, imposing no other garrison upon them but\nthe memory of his gentleness and clemency.  He gave strict and express\ncharge, the day of his great battle of Pharsalia, that, without the\nutmost necessity, no one should lay a hand upon the citizens of Rome.\nThese, in my opinion, were very hazardous proceedings, and \u2018tis no wonder\nif those in our civil war, who, like him, fight against the ancient\nestate of their country, do not follow his example; they are\nextraordinary means, and that only appertain to Caesar\u2019s fortune, and to\nhis admirable foresight in the conduct of affairs.  When I consider the\nincomparable grandeur of his soul, I excuse victory that it could not\ndisengage itself from him, even in so unjust and so wicked a cause.\n\nTo return to his clemency: we have many striking examples in the time of\nhis government, when, all things being reduced to his power, he had no\nmore written against him which he had as sharply answered: yet he did not\nsoon after forbear to use his interest to make him consul.  Caius Calvus,\nwho had composed several injurious epigrams against him, having employed\nmany of his friends to mediate a reconciliation with him, Caesar\nvoluntarily persuaded himself to write first to him.  And our good\nCatullus, who had so rudely ruffled him under the name of Mamurra, coming\nto offer his excuses to him, he made the same day sit at his table.\nHaving intelligence of some who spoke ill of him, he did no more, but\nonly by a public oration declare that he had notice of it.  He still less\nfeared his enemies than he hated them; some conspiracies and cabals that\nwere made against his life being discovered to him, he satisfied himself\nin publishing by proclamation that they were known to him, without\nfurther prosecuting the conspirators.\n\nAs to the respect he had for his friends: Caius Oppius, being with him\nupon a journey, and finding himself ill, he left him the only lodging he\nhad for himself, and lay all night upon a hard ground in the open air.\nAs to what concerns his justice, he put a beloved servant of his to death\nfor lying with a noble Roman\u2019s wife, though there was no complaint made.\nNever had man more moderation in his victory, nor more resolution in his\nadverse fortune.\n\nBut all these good inclinations were stifled and spoiled by his furious\nambition, by which he suffered himself to be so transported and misled\nthat one may easily maintain that this passion was the rudder of all his\nactions; of a liberal man, it made him a public thief to supply this\nbounty and profusion, and made him utter this vile and unjust saying,\n\u201cThat if the most wicked and profligate persons in the world had been\nfaithful in serving him towards his advancement, he would cherish and\nprefer them to the utmost of his power, as much as the best of men.\u201d\n It intoxicated him with so excessive a vanity, as to dare to boast in the\npresence of his fellow-citizens, that he had made the great commonwealth\nof Rome a name without form and without body; and to say that his answers\nfor the future should stand for laws; and also to receive the body of the\nSenate coming to him, sitting; to suffer himself to be adored, and to\nhave divine honours paid to him in his own presence.  To conclude, this\nsole vice, in my opinion, spoiled in him the most rich and beautiful\nnature that ever was, and has rendered his name abominable to all good\nmen, in that he would erect his glory upon the ruins of his country and\nthe subversion of the greatest and most flourishing republic the world\nshall ever see.\n\nThere might, on the contrary, many examples be produced of great men whom\npleasures have made to neglect the conduct of their affairs, as Mark\nAntony and others; but where love and ambition should be in equal\nbalance, and come to jostle with equal forces, I make no doubt but the\nlast would win the prize.\n\nTo return to my subject: \u2018tis much to bridle our appetites by the\nargument of reason, or, by violence, to contain our members within their\nduty; but to lash ourselves for our neighbour\u2019s interest, and not only to\ndivest ourselves of the charming passion that tickles us, of the pleasure\nwe feel in being agreeable to others, and courted and beloved of every\none, but also to conceive a hatred against the graces that produce that\neffect, and to condemn our beauty because it inflames others; of this, I\nconfess, I have met with few examples.  But this is one.  Spurina, a\nyoung man of Tuscany:\n\n         \u201cQualis gemma micat, fulvum quae dividit aurum,\n          Aut collo decus, aut cupiti: vel quale per artem\n          Inclusum buxo aut Oricia terebintho\n          Lucet ebur,\u201d\n\n     [\u201cAs a gem shines enchased in yellow gold, or an ornament on the\n     neck or head, or as ivory has lustre, set by art in boxwood or\n     Orician ebony.\u201d--AEneid, x. 134.]\n\nbeing endowed with a singular beauty, and so excessive, that the chastest\neyes could not chastely behold its rays; not contenting himself with\nleaving so much flame and fever as he everywhere kindled without relief,\nentered into a furious spite against himself and those great endowments\nnature had so liberally conferred upon him, as if a man were responsible\nto himself for the faults of others, and purposely slashed and\ndisfigured, with many wounds and scars, the perfect symmetry and\nproportion that nature had so curiously imprinted in his face.  To give\nmy free opinion, I more admire than honour such actions: such excesses\nare enemies to my rules.  The design was conscientious and good, but\ncertainly a little defective in prudence.  What if his deformity served\nafterwards to make others guilty of the sin of hatred or contempt; or of\nenvy at the glory of so rare a recommendation; or of calumny,\ninterpreting this humour a mad ambition!  Is there any form from which\nvice cannot, if it will, extract occasion to exercise itself, one way or\nanother?  It had been more just, and also more noble, to have made of\nthese gifts of God a subject of exemplary regularity and virtue.\n\nThey who retire themselves from the common offices, from that infinite\nnumber of troublesome rules that fetter a man of exact honesty in civil\nlife, are in my opinion very discreet, what peculiar sharpness of\nconstraint soever they impose upon themselves in so doing.  \u2018Tis in some\nsort a kind of dying to avoid the pain of living well.  They may have\nanother reward; but the reward of difficulty I fancy they can never have;\nnor, in uneasiness, that there can be anything more or better done than\nthe keeping oneself upright amid the waves of the world, truly and\nexactly performing all parts of our duty.  \u2018Tis, peradventure, more easy\nto keep clear of the sex than to maintain one\u2019s self aright in all points\nin the society of a wife; and a man may with less trouble adapt himself\nto entire abstinence than to the due dispensation of abundance.  Use,\ncarried on according to reason, has in it more of difficulty than\nabstinence; moderation is a virtue that gives more work than suffering;\nthe well living of Scipio has a thousand fashions, that of Diogenes but\none; this as much excels the ordinary lives in innocence as the most\naccomplished excel them in utility and force.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV\n\nOBSERVATION ON THE MEANS TO CARRY ON A WAR ACCORDING TO JULIUS CAESAR\n\n\u2018Tis related of many great leaders that they have had certain books in\nparticular esteem, as Alexander the Great, Homer; Scipio Africanus,\nXenophon; Marcus Brutus, Polybius; Charles V., Philip\u2019de Comines; and\n\u2018tis said that, in our times, Machiavelli is elsewhere still in repute;\nbut the late Marshal Strozzi, who had taken Caesar for his man, doubtless\nmade the best choice, seeing that it indeed ought to be the breviary of\nevery soldier, as being the true and sovereign pattern of the military\nart.  And, moreover, God knows with that grace and beauty he has\nembellished that rich matter, with so pure, delicate, and perfect\nexpression, that, in my opinion, there are no writings in the world\ncomparable to his, as to that business.\n\nI will set down some rare and particular passages of his wars that remain\nin my memory.\n\nHis army, being in some consternation upon the rumour that was spread of\nthe great forces that king Juba was leading against him, instead of\nabating the apprehension which his soldiers had conceived at the news and\nof lessening to them the forces of the enemy, having called them all\ntogether to encourage and reassure them, he took a quite contrary way to\nwhat we are used to do, for he told them that they need no more trouble\nthemselves with inquiring after the enemy\u2019s forces, for that he was\ncertainly informed thereof, and then told them of a number much\nsurpassing both the truth and the report that was current in his army;\nfollowing the advice of Cyrus in Xenophon, forasmuch as the deception is\nnot of so great importance to find an enemy weaker than we expected, than\nto find him really very strong, after having been made to believe that he\nwas weak.\n\nIt was always his use to accustom his soldiers simply to obey, without\ntaking upon them to control, or so much as to speak of their captain\u2019s\ndesigns, which he never communicated to them but upon the point of\nexecution; and he took a delight, if they discovered anything of what he\nintended, immediately to change his orders to deceive them; and to that\npurpose, would often, when he had assigned his quarters in a place, pass\nforward and lengthen his day\u2019s march, especially if it was foul and rainy\nweather.\n\nThe Swiss, in the beginning of his wars in Gaul, having sent to him to\ndemand a free passage over the Roman territories, though resolved to\nhinder them by force, he nevertheless spoke kindly to the messengers, and\ntook some respite to return an answer, to make use of that time for the\ncalling his army together.  These silly people did not know how good a\nhusband he was of his time: for he often repeats that it is the best part\nof a captain to know how to make use of occasions, and his diligence in\nhis exploits is, in truth, unheard of and incredible.\n\nIf he was not very conscientious in taking advantage of an enemy under\ncolour of a treaty of agreement, he was as little so in this, that he\nrequired no other virtue in a soldier but valour only, and seldom\npunished any other faults but mutiny and disobedience.  He would often\nafter his victories turn them loose to all sorts of licence, dispensing\nthem for some time from the rules of military discipline, saying withal\nthat he had soldiers so well trained up that, powdered and perfumed, they\nwould run furiously to the fight.  In truth, he loved to have them richly\narmed, and made them wear engraved, gilded, and damasked armour, to the\nend that the care of saving it might engage them to a more obstinate\ndefence.  Speaking to them, he called them by the name of\nfellow-soldiers, which we yet use; which his successor, Augustus,\nreformed, supposing he had only done it upon necessity, and to cajole\nthose who merely followed him as volunteers:\n\n                         \u201cRheni mihi Caesar in undis\n          Dux erat; hic socius; facinus quos inquinat, aequat:\u201d\n\n     [\u201cIn the waters of the Rhine Caesar was my general; here at Rome he\n     is my fellow.  Crime levels those whom it polluted.\u201d\n      --Lucan, v. 289.]\n\nbut that this carriage was too mean and low for the dignity of an emperor\nand general of an army, and therefore brought up the custom of calling\nthem soldiers only.\n\nWith this courtesy Caesar mixed great severity to keep them in awe; the\nninth legion having mutinied near Placentia, he ignominiously cashiered\nthem, though Pompey was then yet on foot, and received them not again to\ngrace till after many supplications; he quieted them more by authority\nand boldness than by gentle ways.\n\nIn that place where he speaks of his, passage over the Rhine to Germany,\nhe says that, thinking it unworthy of the honour of the Roman people to\nwaft over his army in vessels, he built a bridge that they might pass\nover dry-foot.  There it was that he built that wonderful bridge of which\nhe gives so particular a description; for he nowhere so willingly dwells\nupon his actions as in representing to us the subtlety of his inventions\nin such kind of handiwork.\n\nI have also observed this, that he set a great value upon his\nexhortations to the soldiers before the fight; for where he would show\nthat he was either surprised or reduced to a necessity of fighting, he\nalways brings in this, that he had not so much as leisure to harangue his\narmy.  Before that great battle with those of Tournay, \u201cCaesar,\u201d says he,\n\u201chaving given order for everything else, presently ran where fortune\ncarried him to encourage his people, and meeting with the tenth legion,\nhad no more time to say anything to them but this, that they should\nremember their wonted valour; not to be astonished, but bravely sustain\nthe enemy\u2019s encounter; and seeing the enemy had already approached within\na dart\u2019s cast, he gave the signal for battle; and going suddenly thence\nelsewhere, to encourage others, he found that they were already engaged.\u201d\n Here is what he tells us in that place.  His tongue, indeed, did him\nnotable service upon several occasions, and his military eloquence was,\nin his own time, so highly reputed, that many of his army wrote down his\nharangues as he spoke them, by which means there were volumes of them\ncollected that existed a long time after him.  He had so particular a\ngrace in speaking, that his intimates, and Augustus amongst others,\nhearing those orations read, could distinguish even to the phrases and\nwords that were not his.\n\nThe first time that he went out of Rome with any public command, he\narrived in eight days at the river Rhone, having with him in his coach a\nsecretary or two before him who were continually writing, and him who\ncarried his sword behind him.  And certainly, though a man did nothing\nbut go on, he could hardly attain that promptitude with which, having\nbeen everywhere victorious in Gaul, he left it, and, following Pompey to\nBrundusium, in eighteen days\u2019 time he subdued all Italy; returned from\nBrundusium to Rome; from Rome went into the very heart of Spain, where he\nsurmounted extreme difficulties in the war against Afranius and Petreius,\nand in the long siege of Marseilles; thence he returned into Macedonia,\nbeat the Roman army at Pharsalia, passed thence in pursuit of Pompey into\nEgypt, which he also subdued; from Egypt he went into Syria and the\nterritories of Pontus, where he fought Pharnaces; thence into Africa,\nwhere he defeated Scipio and Juba; again returned through Italy, where he\ndefeated Pompey\u2019s sons:\n\n               \u201cOcyor et coeli fiammis, et tigride foeta.\u201d\n\n          [\u201cSwifter than lightning, or the cub-bearing tigress.\u201d\n           --Lucan, v. 405]\n\n              \u201cAc veluti montis saxum de, vertice praeceps\n               Cum ruit avulsum vento, seu turbidus imber\n               Proluit, aut annis solvit sublapsa vetustas,\n               Fertur in abruptum magno mons improbus actu,\n               Exultatque solo, silvas, armenta, virosque,\n               Involvens secum.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cAnd as a stone torn from the mountain\u2019s top by the wind or rain\n     torrents, or loosened by age, falls massive with mighty force,\n     bounds here and there, in its course sweeps from the earth with it\n     woods, herds, and men.\u201d--AEneid, xii. 684.]\n\nSpeaking of the siege of Avaricum, he says, that it, was his custom to be\nnight and day with the pioneers.--[Engineers.  D.W.]--In all enterprises\nof consequence he always reconnoitred in person, and never brought his\narmy into quarters till he had first viewed the place, and, if we may\nbelieve Suetonius, when he resolved to pass over into England, he was the\nfirst man that sounded the passage.\n\nHe was wont to say that he more valued a victory obtained by counsel than\nby force, and in the war against Petreius and Afranius, fortune\npresenting him with an occasion of manifest advantage, he declined it,\nsaying, that he hoped, with a little more time, but less hazard, to\noverthrow his enemies.  He there also played a notable part in commanding\nhis whole army to pass the river by swimming, without any manner of\nnecessity:\n\n                    \u201cRapuitque ruens in praelia miles,\n          Quod fugiens timuisset, iter; mox uda receptis\n          Membra fovent armis, gelidosque a gurgite, cursu\n          Restituunt artus.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThe soldier rushing through a way to fight which he would have\n     been afraid to have taken in flight: then with their armour they\n     cover wet limbs, and by running restore warmth to their numbed\n     joints.\u201d--Lucan, iv.  151.]\n\nI find him a little more temperate and considerate in his enterprises\nthan Alexander, for this man seems to seek and run headlong upon dangers\nlike an impetuous torrent which attacks and rushes against everything it\nmeets, without choice or discretion;\n\n                    \u201cSic tauriformis volvitur Aufidus;\n                    Qui regna Dauni perfluit Appuli,\n                    Dum saevit, horrendamque cultis\n                    Diluviem meditatur agris;\u201d\n\n     [\u201cSo the biforked Aufidus, which flows through the realm of the\n     Apulian Daunus, when raging, threatens a fearful deluge to the\n     tilled ground.\u201d--Horat., Od., iv. 14, 25.]\n\nand, indeed, he was a general in the flower and first heat of his youth,\nwhereas Caesar took up the trade at a ripe and well advanced age; to\nwhich may be added that Alexander was of a more sanguine, hot, and\ncholeric constitution, which he also inflamed with wine, from which\nCaesar was very abstinent.\n\nBut where necessary occasion required, never did any man venture his\nperson more than he: so much so, that for my part, methinks I read in\nmany of his exploits a determinate resolution to throw himself away to\navoid the shame of being overcome.  In his great battle with those of\nTournay, he charged up to the head of the enemies without his shield,\njust as he was seeing the van of his own army beginning to give ground\u2019;\nwhich also several other times befell him.  Hearing that his people were\nbesieged, he passed through the enemy\u2019s army in disguise to go and\nencourage them with his presence.  Having crossed over to Dyrrachium with\nvery slender forces, and seeing the remainder of his army which he had\nleft to Antony\u2019s conduct slow in following him, he undertook alone to\nrepass the sea in a very great storms and privately stole away to fetch\nthe rest of his forces, the ports on the other side being seized by\nPompey, and the whole sea being in his possession.  And as to what he\nperformed by force of hand, there are many exploits that in hazard exceed\nall the rules of war; for with how small means did he undertake to subdue\nthe kingdom of Egypt, and afterwards to attack the forces of Scipio and\nJuba, ten times greater than his own?  These people had, I know not what,\nmore than human confidence in their fortune; and he was wont to say that\nmen must embark, and not deliberate, upon high enterprises.  After the\nbattle of Pharsalia, when he had sent his army away before him into Asia,\nand was passing in one single vessel the strait of the Hellespont, he met\nLucius Cassius at sea with ten tall men-of-war, when he had the courage\nnot only to stay his coming, but to sail up to him and summon him to\nyield, which he did.\n\nHaving undertaken that furious siege of Alexia, where there were\nfourscore thousand men in garrison, all Gaul being in arms to raise the\nsiege and having set an army on foot of a hundred and nine thousand\nhorse, and of two hundred and forty thousand foot, what a boldness and\nvehement confidence was it in him that he would not give over his\nattempt, but resolved upon two so great difficulties--which nevertheless\nhe overcame; and, after having won that great battle against those\nwithout, soon reduced those within to his mercy.  The same happened to\nLucullus at the siege of Tigranocerta against King Tigranes, but the\ncondition of the enemy was not the same, considering the effeminacy of\nthose with whom Lucullus had to deal.  I will here set down two rare and\nextraordinary events concerning this siege of Alexia; one, that the Gauls\nhaving drawn their powers together to encounter Caesar, after they had\nmade a general muster of all their forces, resolved in their council of\nwar to dismiss a good part of this great multitude, that they might not\nfall into confusion.  This example of fearing to be too many is new; but,\nto take it right, it stands to reason that the body of an army should be\nof a moderate greatness, and regulated to certain bounds, both out of\nrespect to the difficulty of providing for them, and the difficulty of\ngoverning and keeping them in order.  At least it is very easy to make it\nappear by example that armies monstrous in number have seldom done\nanything to purpose.  According to the saying of Cyrus in Xenophon,\n\u201c\u2018Tis not the number of men, but the number of good men, that gives the\nadvantage\u201d: the remainder serving rather to trouble than assist.  And\nBajazet principally grounded his resolution of giving Tamerlane battle,\ncontrary to the opinion of all his captains, upon this, that his enemies\nnumberless number of men gave him assured hopes of confusion.\nScanderbeg, a very good and expert judge in such matters, was wont to say\nthat ten or twelve thousand reliable fighting men were sufficient to a\ngood leader to secure his regulation in all sorts of military occasions.\nThe other thing I will here record, which seems to be contrary both to\nthe custom and rules of war, is, that Vercingetorix, who was made general\nof all the parts of the revolted Gaul, should go shut up himself in\nAlexia: for he who has the command of a whole country ought never to shut\nhimself up but in case of such last extremity that the only place he has\nleft is in concern, and that the only hope he has left is in the defence\nof that city; otherwise he ought to keep himself always at liberty, that\nhe may have the means to provide, in general, for all parts of his\ngovernment.\n\nTo return to Caesar.  He grew, in time, more slow and more considerate,\nas his friend Oppius witnesses: conceiving that he ought not lightly to\nhazard the glory of so many victories, which one blow of fortune might\ndeprive him of.  \u2018Tis what the Italians say, when they would reproach the\nrashness and foolhardiness of young people, calling them Bisognosi\nd\u2019onore, \u201cnecessitous of honour,\u201d and that being in so great a want and\ndearth of reputation, they have reason to seek it at what price soever,\nwhich they ought not to do who have acquired enough already.  There may\nreasonably be some moderation, some satiety, in this thirst and appetite\nof glory, as well as in other things: and there are enough people who\npractise it.\n\nHe was far remote from the religious scruples of the ancient Romans, who\nwould never prevail in their wars but by dint of pure and simple valour;\nand yet he was more conscientious than we should be in these days, and\ndid not approve all sorts of means to obtain a victory.  In the war\nagainst Ariovistus, whilst he was parleying with him, there happened some\ncommotion between the horsemen, which was occasioned by the fault of\nAriovistus\u2019 light horse, wherein, though Caesar saw he had a very great\nadvantage of the enemy, he would make no use on\u2019t, lest he should have\nbeen reproached with a treacherous proceeding.\n\nHe was always wont to wear rich garments, and of a shining colour in\nbattle, that he might be the more remarkable and better observed.\n\nHe always carried a stricter and tighter hand over his soldiers when near\nan enemy.  When the ancient Greeks would accuse any one of extreme\ninsufficiency, they would say, in common proverb, that he could neither\nread nor swim; he was of the same opinion, that swimming was of great use\nin war, and himself found it so; for when he had to use diligence, he\ncommonly swam over the rivers in his way; for he loved to march on foot,\nas also did Alexander the Great.  Being in Egypt forced, to save himself,\nto go into a little boat, and so many people leaping in with him that it\nwas in danger of sinking, he chose rather to commit himself to the sea,\nand swam to his fleet, which lay two hundred paces off, holding in his\nleft hand his tablets, and drawing his coatarmour in his teeth, that it\nmight not fall into the enemy\u2019s hand, and at this time he was of a pretty\nadvanced age.\n\nNever had any general so much credit with his soldiers: in the beginning\nof the civil wars, his centurions offered him to find every one a\nman-at-arms at his own charge, and the foot soldiers to serve him at\ntheir own expense; those who were most at their ease, moreover,\nundertaking to defray the more necessitous.  The late Admiral Chastillon\n\n     [Gaspard de Coligny, assassinated  in the St. Bartholomew\n     massacre, 24th August 1572.]\n\nshowed us the like example in our civil wars; for the French of his army\nprovided money out of their own purses to pay the foreigners that were\nwith him.  There are but rarely found examples of so ardent and so ready\nan affection amongst the soldiers of elder times, who kept themselves\nstrictly to their rules of war: passion has a more absolute command over\nus than reason; and yet it happened in the war against Hannibal, that by\nthe example of the people of Rome in the city, the soldiers and captains\nrefused their pay in the army, and in Marcellus\u2019 camp those were branded\nwith the name of Mercenaries who would receive any.  Having got the worst\nof it near Dyrrachium, his soldiers came and offered themselves to be\nchastised and punished, so that there was more need to comfort than\nreprove them.  One single cohort of his withstood four of Pompey\u2019s\nlegions above four hours together, till they were almost all killed with\narrows, so that there were a hundred and thirty thousand shafts found in\nthe trenches.  A soldier called Scaeva, who commanded at one of the\navenues, invincibly maintained his ground, having lost an eye, with one\nshoulder and one thigh shot through, and his shield hit in two hundred\nand thirty places. It happened that many of his soldiers being taken\nprisoners, rather chose to die than promise to join the contrary side.\nGranius Petronius was taken by Scipio in Africa: Scipio having put the\nrest to death, sent him word that he gave him his life, for he was a man\nof quality and quaestor, to whom Petronius sent answer back, that\nCaesar\u2019s soldiers were wont to give others their life, and not to receive\nit; and immediately with his own hand killed himself.\n\nOf their fidelity there are infinite examples amongst them, that which\nwas done by those who were besieged in Salona, a city that stood for\nCaesar against Pompey, is not, for the rarity of an accident that there\nhappened, to be forgotten.  Marcus Octavius kept them close besieged;\nthey within being reduced to the extremest necessity of all things, so\nthat to supply the want of men, most of them being either slain or\nwounded, they had manumitted all their slaves, and had been constrained\nto cut off all the women\u2019s hair to make ropes for their war engines,\nbesides a wonderful dearth of victuals, and yet continuing resolute never\nto yield.  After having drawn the siege to a great length, by which\nOctavius was grown more negligent and less attentive to his enterprise,\nthey made choice of one day about noon, and having first placed the women\nand children upon the walls to make a show, sallied upon the besiegers\nwith such fury, that having routed the first, second, and third body, and\nafterwards the fourth, and the rest, and beaten them all out of their\ntrenches, they pursued them even to their ships, and Octavius himself was\nfain to fly to Dyrrachium, where Pompey lay.  I do not at present\nremember that I have met with any other example where the besieged ever\ngave the besieger a total defeat and won the field, nor that a sortie\never achieved the result of a pure and entire victory.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXV\n\nOF THREE GOOD WOMEN\n\nThey are not by the dozen, as every one knows, and especially in the\nduties of marriage, for that is a bargain full of so many nice\ncircumstances that \u2018tis hard a woman\u2019s will should long endure such a\nrestraint; men, though their condition be something better under that\ntie, have yet enough to do.  The true touch and test of a happy marriage\nhave respect to the time of the companionship, if it has been constantly\ngentle, loyal, and agreeable.  In our age, women commonly reserve the\npublication of their good offices, and their vehement affection towards\ntheir husbands, until they have lost them, or at least, till then defer\nthe testimonies of their good will; a too slow testimony and\nunseasonable. By it they rather manifest that they never loved them till\ndead: their life is nothing but trouble; their death full of love and\ncourtesy.  As fathers conceal their affection from their children, women,\nlikewise, conceal theirs from their husbands, to maintain a modest\nrespect.  This mystery is not for my palate; \u2018tis to much purpose that\nthey scratch themselves and tear their hair.  I whisper in a\nwaiting-woman\u2019s or secretary\u2019s ear: \u201cHow were they, how did they live\ntogether?\u201d I always have that good saying m my head:\n\n               \u201cJactantius moerent, quae minus dolent.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThey make the most ado who are least concerned.\u201d (Or:)\n     \u201cThey mourn the more ostentatiously, the less they grieve.\u201d\n      --Tacitus, Annal., ii. 77, writing of Germanicus.]\n\nTheir whimpering is offensive to the living and vain to the dead.  We\nshould willingly give them leave to laugh after we are dead, provided\nthey will smile upon us whilst we are alive.  Is it not enough to make a\nman revive in pure spite, that she, who spat in my face whilst I was in\nbeing, shall come to kiss my feet when I am no more?  If there be any\nhonour in lamenting a husband, it only appertains to those who smiled\nupon them whilst they had them; let those who wept during their lives\nlaugh at their deaths, as well outwardly as within.  Therefore, never\nregard those blubbered eyes and that pitiful voice; consider her\ndeportment, her complexion, the plumpness of her cheeks under all those\nformal veils; \u2018tis there she talks plain French.  There are few who do\nnot mend upon\u2019t, and health is a quality that cannot lie.  That starched\nand ceremonious countenance looks not so much back as forward, and is\nrather intended to get a new husband than to lament the old.  When I was\na boy, a very beautiful and virtuous lady, who is yet living, the widow\nof a prince, wore somewhat more ornament in her dress than our laws of\nwidowhood allow, and being reproached with it, she made answer that it\nwas because she was resolved to have no more love affairs, and would\nnever marry again.\n\nI have here, not at all dissenting from our customs, made choice of three\nwomen, who have also expressed the utmost of their goodness and affection\nabout their husbands\u2019 deaths; yet are they examples of another kind than\nare now m use, and so austere that they will hardly be drawn into\nimitation.\n\nThe younger Pliny\u2019 had near a house of his in Italy a neighbour who was\nexceedingly tormented with certain ulcers in his private parts.  His wife\nseeing him so long to languish, entreated that he would give her leave to\nsee and at leisure to consider of the condition of his disease, and that\nshe would freely tell him what she thought.  This permission being\nobtained, and she having curiously examined the business, found it\nimpossible he could ever be cured, and that all he had to hope for or\nexpect was a great while to linger out a painful and miserable life, and\ntherefore, as the most sure and sovereign remedy, resolutely advised him\nto kill himself.  But finding him a little tender and backward in so rude\nan attempt: \u201cDo not think, my friend,\u201d said she, \u201cthat the torments I see\nthee endure are not as sensible to me as to thyself, and that to deliver\nmyself from them, I will not myself make use of the same remedy I have\nprescribed to thee.  I will accompany thee in the cure as I have done in\nthe disease; fear nothing, but believe that we shall have pleasure in\nthis passage that is to free us from so many miseries, and we will go\nhappily together.\u201d  Which having said, and roused up her husband\u2019s\ncourage, she resolved that they should throw themselves headlong into the\nsea out of a window that overlooked it, and that she might maintain to\nthe last the loyal and vehement affection wherewith she had embraced him\nduring his life, she would also have him die in her arms; but lest they\nshould fail, and should quit their hold in the fall through fear, she\ntied herself fast to him by the waist, and so gave up her own life to\nprocure her husband\u2019s repose.  This was a woman of mean condition; and,\namongst that class of people, \u2018tis no very new thing to see some examples\nof rare virtue:\n\n                         \u201cExtrema per illos\n               Justitia excedens terris vestigia fecit.\u201d\n\n          [\u201cJustice, when she left the earth, took her last\n          steps among them.\u201d--Virgil, Georg., ii.  473.]\n\nThe other two were noble and rich, where examples of virtue are rarely\nlodged.\n\nArria, the wife of Caecina Paetus, a consular person, was the mother of\nanother Arria, the wife of Thrasea Paetus, he whose virtue was so\nrenowned in the time of Nero, and by this son-in-law, the grandmother of\nFannia: for the resemblance of the names of these men and women, and\ntheir fortunes, have led to several mistakes.  This first Arria, her\nhusband Caecina Paetus, having been taken prisoner by some of the Emperor\nClaudius\u2019 people, after Scribonianus\u2019 defeat, whose party he had embraced\nin the war, begged of those who were to carry him prisoner to Rome, that\nthey would take her into their ship, where she would be of much less\ncharge and trouble to them than a great many persons they must otherwise\nhave to attend her husband, and that she alone would undertake to serve\nhim in his chamber, his kitchen, and all other offices.  They refused,\nwhereupon she put herself into a fisher-boat she hired on the spot, and\nin that manner followed him from Sclavonia.  When she had come to Rome,\nJunia, the widow of Scribonianus, having one day, from the resemblance of\ntheir fortune, accosted her in the Emperor\u2019s presence; she rudely\nrepulsed her with these words, \u201cI,\u201d said she, \u201cspeak to thee, or give ear\nto any thing thou sayest! to thee in whose lap Scribonianus was slain,\nand thou art yet alive!\u201d  These words, with several other signs, gave her\nfriends to understand that she would undoubtedly despatch herself,\nimpatient of supporting her husband\u2019s misfortune.  And Thrasea, her\nson-in-law, beseeching her not to throw away herself, and saying to her,\n\u201cWhat! if I should run the same fortune that Caecina has done, would you\nthat your daughter, my wife, should do the same?\u201d--\u201cWould I?\u201d  replied\nshe, \u201cyes, yes, I would: if she had lived as long, and in as good\nunderstanding with thee as I have done, with my husband.\u201d  These answers\nmade them more careful of her, and to have a more watchful eye to her\nproceedings.  One day, having said to those who looked to her: \u201cTis to\nmuch purpose that you take all this pains to prevent me; you may indeed\nmake me die an ill death, but to keep me from dying is not in your\npower\u201d; she in a sudden phrenzy started from a chair whereon she sat, and\nwith all her force dashed her head against the wall, by which blow being\nlaid flat in a swoon, and very much wounded, after they had again with\ngreat ado brought her to herself: \u201cI told you,\u201d said she, \u201cthat if you\nrefused me some easy way of dying, I should find out another, how painful\nsoever.\u201d  The conclusion of so admirable a virtue was this: her husband\nPaetus, not having resolution enough of his own to despatch himself, as\nhe was by the emperor\u2019s cruelty enjoined, one day, amongst others, after\nhaving first employed all the reasons and exhortations which she thought\nmost prevalent to persuade him to it, she snatched the poignard he wore\nfrom his side, and holding it ready in her hand, for the conclusion of\nher admonitions; \u201cDo thus, Paetus,\u201d said she, and in the same instant\ngiving herself a mortal stab in the breast, and then drawing it out of\nthe wound, presented it to him, ending her life with this noble,\ngenerous, and immortal saying, \u201cPaete, non dolet\u201d--having time to\npronounce no more but those three never-to-be-forgotten words: \u201cPaetus,\nit is not painful.\u201d\n\n              \u201cCasta suo gladium cum traderet Arria Paeto,\n               Quern de visceribus traxerat ipsa suis\n               Si qua fides, vulnus quod feci non dolet, inquit,\n               Sed quod to facies, id mihi, Paete, dolet.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cWhen the chaste Arria gave to Poetus the reeking sword she had\n     drawn from her breast, \u2018If you believe me,\u2019 she said, \u2018Paetus, the\n     wound I have made hurts not, but \u2018tis that which thou wilt make that\n     hurts me.\u2019\u201d---Martial, i. 14.]\n\nThe action was much more noble in itself, and of a braver sense than the\npoet expressed it: for she was so far from being deterred by the thought\nof her husband\u2019s wound and death and her own, that she had been their\npromotress and adviser: but having performed this high and courageous\nenterprise for her husband\u2019s only convenience, she had even in the last\ngasp of her life no other concern but for him, and of dispossessing him\nof the fear of dying with her.  Paetus presently struck himself to the\nheart with the same weapon, ashamed, I suppose, to have stood in need of\nso dear and precious an example.\n\nPompeia Paulina, a young and very noble Roman lady, had married Seneca in\nhis extreme old age.  Nero, his fine pupil, sent his guards to him to\ndenounce the sentence of death, which was performed after this manner:\nWhen the Roman emperors of those times had condemned any man of quality,\nthey sent to him by their officers to choose what death he would, and to\nexecute it within such or such a time, which was limited, according to\nthe degree of their indignation, to a shorter or a longer respite, that\nthey might therein have better leisure to dispose their affairs, and\nsometimes depriving them of the means of doing it by the shortness of the\ntime; and if the condemned seemed unwilling to submit to the order, they\nhad people ready at hand to execute it either by cutting the veins of the\narms and legs, or by compelling them by force to swallow a draught of\npoison.  But persons of honour would not abide this necessity, but made\nuse of their own physicians and surgeons for this purpose.  Seneca, with\na calm and steady countenance, heard their charge, and presently called\nfor paper to write his will, which being by the captain refused, he\nturned himself towards his friends, saying to them, \u201cSince I cannot leave\nyou any other acknowledgment of the obligation I have to you, I leave you\nat least the best thing I have, namely, the image of my life and manners,\nwhich I entreat you to keep in memory of me, that by so doing you may\nacquire the glory of sincere and real friends.\u201d  And there withal, one\nwhile appeasing the sorrow he saw in them with gentle words, and\npresently raising his voice to reprove them: \u201cWhat,\u201d said he, \u201care become\nof all our brave philosophical precepts? What are become of all the\nprovisions we have so many years laid up against the accidents of\nfortune? Is Nero\u2019s cruelty unknown to us?  What could we expect from him\nwho had murdered his mother and his brother, but that he should put his\ntutor to death who had brought him up?\u201d  After having spoken these words\nin general, he turned himself towards his wife, and embracing her fast in\nhis arms, as, her heart and strength failing her, she was ready to sink\ndown with grief, he begged of her, for his sake, to bear this accident\nwith a little more patience, telling her, that now the hour was come\nwherein he was to show, not by argument and discourse, but effect, the\nfruit he had acquired by his studies, and that he really embraced his\ndeath, not only without grief, but moreover with joy.  \u201cWherefore, my\ndearest,\u201d said he, \u201cdo not dishonour it with thy tears, that it may not\nseem as if thou lovest thyself more than my reputation.  Moderate thy\ngrief, and comfort thyself in the knowledge thou hast had of me and my\nactions, leading the remainder of thy life in the same virtuous manner\nthou hast hitherto done.\u201d  To which Paulina, having a little recovered\nher spirits, and warmed the magnanimity of her courage with a most\ngenerous affection, replied,--\u201cNo, Seneca,\u201d said she, \u201cI am not a woman\nto suffer you to go alone in such a necessity: I will not have you think\nthat the virtuous examples of your life have not taught me how to die;\nand when can I ever better or more fittingly do it, or more to my own\ndesire, than with you? and therefore assure yourself I will go along with\nyou.\u201d  Then Seneca, taking this noble and generous resolution of his wife\nm good part, and also willing to free himself from the fear of leaving\nher exposed to the cruelty of his enemies after his death: \u201cI have,\nPaulina,\u201d said he, \u201cinstructed thee in what would serve thee happily to\nlive; but thou more covetest, I see, the honour of dying: in truth,\nI will not grudge it thee; the constancy and resolution in our common end\nare the same, but the beauty and glory of thy part are much greater.\u201d\n Which being said, the surgeons, at the same time, opened the veins of\nboth their arms, but as those of Seneca were more shrunk up, as well with\nage as abstinence, made his blood flow too slowly, he moreover commanded\nthem to open the veins of his thighs; and lest the torments he endured\nmight pierce his wife\u2019s heart, and also to free himself from the\naffliction of seeing her in so sad a condition, after having taken a very\naffectionate leave of her, he entreated she would suffer them to carry\nher into her chamber, which they accordingly did.  But all these\nincisions being not yet enough to make him die, he commanded Statius\nAnneus, his physician, to give him a draught of poison, which had not\nmuch better effect; for by reason of the weakness and coldness of his\nlimbs, it could not arrive at his heart.  Wherefore they were forced to\nsuperadd a very hot bath, and then, feeling his end approach, whilst he\nhad breath he continued excellent discourses upon the subject of his\npresent condition, which the secretaries wrote down so long as they could\nhear his voice, and his last words were long after in high honour and\nesteem amongst men, and it is a great loss to us that they have not come\ndown to our times.  Then, feeling the last pangs of death, with the\nbloody water of the bath he bathed his head, saying: \u201cThis water I\ndedicate to Jupiter the deliverer.\u201d  Nero, being presently informed of\nall this, fearing lest the death of Paulina, who was one of the best-born\nladies of Rome, and against whom he had no particular unkindness, should\nturn to his reproach, sent orders in all haste to bind up her wounds,\nwhich her attendants did without her knowledge, she being already half\ndead, and without all manner of sense.  Thus, though she lived contrary\nto her own design, it was very honourably, and befitting her own virtue,\nher pale complexion ever after manifesting how much life had run from her\nveins.\n\nThese are my three very true stories, which I find as entertaining and as\ntragic as any of those we make out of our own heads wherewith to amuse\nthe common people; and I wonder that they who are addicted to such\nrelations, do not rather cull out ten thousand very fine stories, which\nare to be found in books, that would save them the trouble of invention,\nand be more useful and diverting; and he who would make a whole and\nconnected body of them would need to add nothing of his own, but the\nconnection only, as it were the solder of another metal; and might by\nthis means embody a great many true events of all sorts, disposing and\ndiversifying them according as the beauty of the work should require,\nafter the same manner, almost, as Ovid has made up his Metamorphoses of\nthe infinite number of various fables.\n\nIn the last couple, this is, moreover, worthy of consideration, that\nPaulina voluntarily offered to lose her life for the love of her husband,\nand that her husband had formerly also forborne to die for the love of\nher.  We may think there is no just counterpoise in this exchange; but,\naccording to his stoical humour, I fancy he thought he had done as much\nfor her, in prolonging his life upon her account, as if he had died for\nher.  In one of his letters to Lucilius, after he has given him to\nunderstand that, being seized with an ague in Rome, he presently took\ncoach to go to a house he had in the country, contrary to his wife\u2019s\nopinion, who would have him stay, and that he had told her that the ague\nhe was seized with was not a fever of the body but of the place, it\nfollows thus: \u201cShe let me go,\u201d says he, \u201cgiving me a strict charge of my\nhealth.  Now I, who know that her life is involved in mine, begin to make\nmuch of myself, that I may preserve her.  And I lose the privilege my age\nhas given me, of being more constant and resolute in many things, when I\ncall to mind that in this old fellow there is a young girl who is\ninterested in his health.  And since I cannot persuade her to love me\nmore courageously, she makes me more solicitously love myself: for we\nmust allow something to honest affections, and, sometimes, though\noccasions importune us to the contrary, we must call back life, even\nthough it be with torment: we must hold the soul fast in our teeth, since\nthe rule of living, amongst good men, is not so long as they please, but\nas long as they ought.  He that loves not his wife nor his friend so well\nas to prolong his life for them, but will obstinately die, is too\ndelicate and too effeminate: the soul must impose this upon itself, when\nthe utility of our friends so requires; we must sometimes lend ourselves\nto our friends, and when we would die for ourselves must break that\nresolution for them.  \u2018Tis a testimony of grandeur of courage to return\nto life for the consideration of another, as many excellent persons have\ndone: and \u2018tis a mark of singular good nature to preserve old age (of\nwhich the greatest convenience is the indifference as to its duration,\nand a more stout and disdainful use of life), when a man perceives that\nthis office is pleasing, agreeable, and useful to some person by whom he\nis very much beloved.  And a man reaps by it a very pleasing reward; for\nwhat can be more delightful than to be so dear to his wife, as upon her\naccount he shall become dearer to himself?  Thus has my Paulina loaded me\nnot only with her fears, but my own; it has not been sufficient to\nconsider how resolutely I could die, but I have also considered how\nirresolutely she would bear my death.  I am enforced to live, and\nsometimes to live in magnanimity.\u201d  These are his own words, as excellent\nas they everywhere are.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVI\n\nOF THE MOST EXCELLENT MEN\n\nIf I should be asked my choice among all the men who have come to my\nknowledge, I should make answer, that methinks I find three more\nexcellent than all the rest.\n\nOne of them Homer: not that Aristotle and Varro, for example, were not,\nperadventure, as learned as he; nor that possibly Virgil was not equal to\nhim in his own art, which I leave to be determined by such as know them\nboth.  I who, for my part, understand but one of them, can only say this,\naccording to my poor talent, that I do not believe the Muses themselves\ncould ever go beyond the Roman:\n\n              \u201cTale facit carmen docta testudine, quale\n               Cynthius impositis temperat articulis:\u201d\n\n     [\u201cHe plays on his learned lute a verse such as Cynthian Apollo\n     modulates with his imposed fingers.\u201d--Propertius, ii. 34, 79.]\n\nand yet in this judgment we are not to forget that it is chiefly from\nHomer that Virgil derives his excellence, that he is guide and teacher;\nand that one touch of the Iliad has supplied him with body and matter out\nof which to compose his great and divine AEneid.  I do not reckon upon\nthat, but mix several other circumstances that render to me this poet\nadmirable, even as it were above human condition.  And, in truth, I often\nwonder that he who has produced, and, by his authority, given reputation\nin the world to so many deities, was not deified himself.  Being blind\nand poor, living before the sciences were reduced into rule and certain\nobservation, he was so well acquainted with them, that all those who have\nsince taken upon them to establish governments, to carry on wars, and to\nwrite either of religion or philosophy, of what sect soever, or of the\narts, have made use of him as of a most perfect instructor in the\nknowledge of all things, and of his books as of a treasury of all sorts\nof learning:\n\n         \u201cQui, quid sit pulcrum, quid turpe, quid utile, quid non,\n          Planius ac melius Chrysippo et Crantore dicit:\u201d\n\n     [\u201cWho tells us what is good, what evil, what useful, what not, more\n     clearly and better than Chrysippus and Crantor?\u201d\n      --Horace, Ep., i. 2, 3.]\n\nand as this other says,\n\n                   \u201cA quo, ceu fonte perenni,\n                    Vatum Pieriis ora rigantur aquis\u201d\n\n     [\u201cFrom which, as from a perennial spring, the lips of the poets\n     are moistened by Pierian waters.\u201d--Ovid, Amoy., iii. 9, 25.]\n\nand the other,\n\n              \u201cAdde Heliconiadum comites, quorum unus Homerus\n               Sceptra potitus;\u201d\n\n     [\u201cAdd the companions of the Muses, whose sceptre Homer has solely\n     obtained.\u201d--Lucretius, iii.  1050.]\n\nand the other:\n\n                         \u201cCujusque ex ore profusos\n               Omnis posteritas latices in carmina duxit,\n               Amnemque in tenues ausa est deducere rivos.\n               Unius foecunda bonis.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cFrom whose mouth all posterity has drawn out copious streams of\n     verse, and has made bold to turn the mighty river into its little\n     rivulets, fertile in the property of one man.\u201d\n      --Manilius, Astyon., ii. 8.]\n\n\u2018Tis contrary to the order of nature that he has made the most excellent\nproduction that can possibly be; for the ordinary birth of things is\nimperfect; they thrive and gather strength by growing, whereas he\nrendered the infancy of poesy and several other sciences mature, perfect,\nand accomplished at first.  And for this reason he may be called the\nfirst and the last of the poets, according to the fine testimony\nantiquity has left us of him, \u201cthat as there was none before him whom he\ncould imitate, so there has been none since that could imitate him.\u201d\n His words, according to Aristotle, are the only words that have motion\nand action, the only substantial words.  Alexander the Great, having\nfound a rich cabinet amongst Darius\u2019 spoils, gave order it should be\nreserved for him to keep his Homer in, saying: that he was the best and\nmost faithful counsellor he had in his military affairs.  For the same\nreason it was that Cleomenes, the son of Anaxandridas, said that he was\nthe poet of the Lacedaemonians, for that he was an excellent master for\nthe discipline of war.  This singular and particular commendation is also\nleft of him in the judgment of Plutarch, that he is the only author in\nthe world that never glutted nor disgusted his readers, presenting\nhimself always another thing, and always flourishing in some new grace.\nThat wanton Alcibiades, having asked one, who pretended to learning, for\na book of Homer, gave him a box of the ear because he had none,  which he\nthought as scandalous as we should if we found one of our priests without\na Breviary.  Xenophanes complained one day to Hiero, the tyrant of\nSyracuse, that he was so poor he had not wherewithal to maintain two\nservants.  \u201cWhat!\u201d replied he, \u201cHomer, who was much poorer than thou\nart, keeps above ten thousand, though he is dead.\u201d  What did Panaetius\nleave unsaid when he called Plato the Homer of the philosophers?  Besides\nwhat glory can be compared to his?  Nothing is so frequent in men\u2019s\nmouths as his name and works, nothing so known and received as Troy,\nHelen, and the war about her, when perhaps there was never any such\nthing.  Our children are still called by names that he invented above\nthree thousand years ago; who does not know Hector and Achilles?  Not\nonly some particular families, but most nations also seek their origin in\nhis inventions.  Mohammed, the second of that name, emperor of the Turks,\nwriting to our Pope Pius II., \u201cI am astonished,\u201d says he, \u201cthat the\nItalians should appear against me, considering that we have our common\ndescent from the Trojans, and that it concerns me as well as it does them\nto revenge the blood of Hector upon the Greeks, whom they countenance\nagainst me.\u201d  Is it not a noble farce wherein kings, republics, and\nemperors have so many ages played their parts, and to which the vast\nuniverse serves for a theatre?  Seven Grecian cities contended for his\nbirth, so much honour even his obscurity helped him to!\n\n     \u201cSmyrna, Rhodos, Colophon, Salamis, Chios, Argos, Athenm.\u201d\n\nThe other is Alexander the Great.  For whoever will consider the age at\nwhich he began his enterprises, the small means by which he effected so\nglorious a design, the authority he obtained in such mere youth with the\ngreatest and most experienced captains of the world, by whom he was\nfollowed, the extraordinary favour wherewith fortune embraced and\nfavoured so many hazardous, not to say rash, exploits,\n\n               \u201cImpellens quicquid sibi summa petenti\n               Obstaret, gaudensque viam fecisse ruins;\u201d\n\n     [\u201cBearing down all who sought to withstand him, and pleased\n     to force his way by ruin.\u201d--Lucan, i. 149.]\n\nthat greatness, to have at the age of three-and-thirty years, passed\nvictorious through the whole habitable earth, and in half a life to have\nattained to the utmost of what human nature can do; so that you cannot\nimagine its just duration and the continuation of his increase in valour\nand fortune, up to a due maturity of age, but that you must withal\nimagine something more than man: to have made so many royal branches to\nspring from his soldiers, leaving the world, at his death, divided\namongst four successors, simple captains of his army, whose posterity so\nlong continued and maintained that vast possession; so many excellent\nvirtues as he was master of, justice, temperance, liberality, truth in\nhis word, love towards his own people, and humanity towards those he\novercame; for his manners, in general, seem in truth incapable of any\nmanner of reproach, although some particular and extraordinary actions of\nhis may fall under censure.  But it is impossible to carry on such great\nthings as he did within the strict rules of justice; such as he are to be\njudged in gross by the main end of their actions. The ruin of Thebes and\nPersepolis, the murder of Menander and of Ephistion\u2019s physician, the\nmassacre of so many Persian prisoners at one time, of a troop of Indian\nsoldiers not without prejudice to his word, and of the Cossians, so much\nas to the very children, are indeed sallies that are not well to be\nexcused.  For, as to Clytus, the fault was more than redeemed; and that\nvery action, as much as any other whatever, manifests the goodness of his\nnature, a nature most excellently formed to goodness; and it was\ningeniously said of him, that he had his virtues from Nature, his vices\nfrom Fortune.  As to his being a little given to bragging, a little too\nimpatient of hearing himself ill-spoken of, and as to those mangers,\narms, and bits he caused to be strewed in the Indies, all those little\nvanities, methinks, may very well be allowed to his youth, and the\nprodigious prosperity of his fortune.  And who will consider withal his\nso many military virtues, his diligence, foresight, patience, discipline,\nsubtlety, magnanimity, resolution, and good fortune, wherein (though we\nhad not had the authority of Hannibal to assure us) he was the first of\nmen, the admirable beauty and symmetry of his person, even to a miracle,\nhis majestic port and awful mien, in a face so young, ruddy, and radiant:\n\n              \u201cQualis, ubi Oceani perfusus Lucifer unda,\n               Quem Venus ante alios astrorum diligit ignes,\n               Extulit os sacrum coelo, tenebrasque resolvit;\u201d\n\n     [\u201cAs when, bathed in the waves of Ocean, Lucifer, whom Venus loves\n     beyond the other stars, has displayed his sacred countenance to the\n     heaven, and disperses the darkness\u201d--AEneid, iii. 589.]\n\nthe excellence of his knowledge and capacity; the duration and grandeur\nof his glory, pure, clean, without spot or envy, and that long after his\ndeath it was a religious belief that his very medals brought good fortune\nto all who carried them about them; and that more kings and princes have\nwritten his actions than other historians have written the actions of any\nother king or prince whatever; and that to this very day the Mohammedans,\nwho despise all other histories, admit of and honour his alone, by a\nspecial privilege: whoever, I say, will seriously consider these\nparticulars, will confess that, all these things put together, I had\nreason to prefer him before Caesar himself, who alone could make me\ndoubtful in my choice: and it cannot be denied that there was more of his\nown in his exploits, and more of fortune in those of Alexander.  They\nwere in many things equal, and peradventure Caesar had some greater\nqualities they were two fires, or two torrents, overrunning the world by\nseveral ways;\n\n              \u201cAc velut immissi diversis partibus ignes\n               Arentem in silvam, et virgulta sonantia lauro\n               Aut ubi decursu rapido de montibus altis\n               Dant sonitum spumosi amnes, et in aequora currunt,\n               Quisque suum populatus iter:\u201d\n\n     [\u201cAnd as fires applied in several parts to a dry wood and crackling\n     shrubs of laurel, or as with impetuous fall from the steep\n     mountains, foaming torrents pour down to the ocean, each clearing a\n     destructive course.\u201d--AEneid, xii. 521.]\n\nbut though Caesar\u2019s ambition had been more moderate, it would still be so\nunhappy, having the ruin of his country and universal mischief to the\nworld for its abominable object, that, all things raked together and put\ninto the balance, I must needs incline to Alexander\u2019s side.\n\nThe third and in my opinion the most excellent, is Epaminondas.  Of glory\nhe has not near so much as the other two (which, for that matter, is but\na part of the substance of the thing): of valour and resolution, not of\nthat sort which is pushed on by ambition, but of that which wisdom and\nreason can plant in a regular soul, he had all that could be imagined.\nOf this virtue of his, he has, in my idea, given as ample proof as\nAlexander himself or Caesar: for although his warlike exploits were\nneither so frequent nor so full, they were yet, if duly considered in all\ntheir circumstances, as important, as bravely fought, and carried with\nthem as manifest testimony of valour and military conduct, as those of\nany whatever.  The Greeks have done him the honour, without\ncontradiction, to pronounce him the greatest man of their nation; and to\nbe the first of Greece, is easily to be the first of the world.  As to\nhis knowledge, we have this ancient judgment of him, \u201cThat never any man\nknew so much, and spake so little as he\u201d;--[Plutarch, On the Demon of\nSocrates, c. 23.]--for he was of the Pythagorean sect; but when he did\nspeak, never any man spake better; an excellent orator, and of powerful\npersuasion.  But as to his manners and conscience, he infinitely\nsurpassed all men who ever undertook the management of affairs; for in\nthis one thing, which ought chiefly to be considered, which alone truly\ndenotes us for what we are, and which alone I make counterbalance all the\nrest put together, he comes not short of any philosopher whatever, not\neven of Socrates himself.  Innocence, in this man, is a quality peculiar,\nsovereign, constant, uniform, incorruptible, compared with which, it\nappears in Alexander subject to something else subaltern, uncertain,\nvariable, effeminate, and fortuitous.\n\nAntiquity has judged that in thoroughly sifting all the other great\ncaptains, there is found in every one some peculiar quality that\nillustrates his name: in this man only there is a full and equal virtue\nthroughout, that leaves nothing to be wished for in him, whether in\nprivate or public employment, whether in peace or war; whether to live\ngloriously and grandly, and to die: I do not know any form or fortune of\nman that I so much honour and love.\n\n\u2018Tis true that I look upon his obstinate poverty, as it is set out by his\nbest friends, as a little too scrupulous and nice; and this is the only\nfeature, though high in itself and well worthy of admiration, that I find\nso rugged as not to desire to imitate, to the degree it was in him.\n\nScipio AEmilianus alone, could one attribute to him as brave and\nmagnificent an end, and as profound and universal a knowledge, might be\nput into the other scale of the balance.  Oh, what an injury has time\ndone me to deprive me of the sight of two of the most noble lives which,\nby the common consent of all the world, one of the greatest of the\nGreeks, and the other of the Romans, were in all Plutarch.  What a\nmatter! what a workman!\n\nFor a man that was no saint, but, as we say, a gentleman, of civilian and\nordinary manners, and of a moderate ambition, the richest life that I\nknow, and full of the richest and most to be desired parts, all things\nconsidered, is, in my opinion, that of Alcibiades.\n\nBut as to what concerns Epaminondas, I will here, for the example of an\nexcessive goodness, add some of his opinions: he declared, that the\ngreatest satisfaction he ever had in his whole life, was the contentment\nhe gave his father and mother by his victory at Leuctra; wherein his\ndeference is great, preferring their pleasure before his own, so dust and\nso full of so glorious an action.  He did not think it lawful, even to\nrestore the liberty of his country, to kill a man without knowing a\ncause: which made him so cold in the enterprise of his companion\nPelopidas for the relief of Thebes.  He was also of opinion that men in\nbattle ought to avoid the encounter of a friend who was on the contrary\nside, and to spare him.  And his humanity, even towards his enemies\nthemselves, having rendered him suspected to the Boeotians, for that,\nafter he had miraculously forced the Lacedaemonians to open to him the\npass which they had undertaken to defend at the entrance into the Morea,\nnear Corinth, he contented himself with having charged through them,\nwithout pursuing them to the utmost, he had his commission of general\ntaken from him, very honourably upon such an account, and for the shame\nit was to them upon necessity afterwards to restore him to his command,\nand so to manifest how much upon him depended their safety and honour;\nvictory like a shadow attending him wherever he went; and indeed the\nprosperity of his country, as being from him derived, died with him.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVII\n\nOF THE RESEMBLANCE OF CHILDREN TO THEIR FATHERS\n\nThis faggoting up of so many divers pieces is so done that I never set\npen to paper but when I have too much idle time, and never anywhere but\nat home; so that it is compiled after divers interruptions and intervals,\noccasions keeping me sometimes many months elsewhere.  As to the rest,\nI never correct my first by any second conceptions; I, peradventure, may\nalter a word or so, but \u2018tis only to vary the phrase, and not to destroy\nmy former meaning.  I have a mind to represent the progress of my\nhumours, and that every one may see each piece as it came from the forge.\nI could wish I had begun sooner, and had taken more notice of the course\nof my mutations.  A servant of mine whom I employed to transcribe for me,\nthought he had got a prize by stealing several pieces from me, wherewith\nhe was best pleased; but it is my comfort that he will be no greater a\ngainer than I shall be a loser by the theft.  I am grown older by seven\nor eight years since I began; nor has it been without same new\nacquisition: I have, in that time, by the liberality of years, been\nacquainted with the stone: their commerce and long converse do not well\npass away without some such inconvenience.  I could have been glad that\nof other infirmities age has to present long-lived men withal, it had\nchosen some one that would have been more welcome to me, for it could not\npossibly have laid upon me a disease for which, even from my infancy, I\nhave had so great a horror; and it is, in truth, of all the accidents of\nold age, that of which I have ever been most afraid.  I have often\nthought with myself that I went on too far, and that in so long a voyage\nI should at last run myself into some disadvantage; I perceived, and have\noften enough declared, that it was time to depart, and that life should\nbe cut off in the sound and living part, according to the surgeon\u2019s rule\nin amputations; and that nature made him pay very strict usury who did\nnot in due time pay the principal.  And yet I was so far from being\nready, that in the eighteen months\u2019 time or thereabout that I have been\nin this uneasy condition, I have so inured myself to it as to be content\nto live on in it; and have found wherein to comfort myself, and to hope:\nso much are men enslaved to their miserable being, that there is no\ncondition so wretched they will not accept, provided they may live!  Hear\nMaecenas:\n\n                        \u201cDebilem facito manu,\n                         Debilem pede, coxa,\n                         Lubricos quate dentes;\n                         Vita dum superest, bene est.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cCripple my hand, foot, hip; shake out my loose teeth: while\n     there\u2019s life, \u2018tis well.\u201d--Apud Seneca, Ep., 101.]\n\nAnd Tamerlane, with a foolish humanity, palliated the fantastic cruelty\nhe exercised upon lepers, when he put all he could hear of to death, to\ndeliver them, as he pretended, from the painful life they lived.  For\nthere was not one of them who would not rather have been thrice a leper\nthan be not.  And Antisthenes the Stoic, being very sick, and crying out,\n\u201cWho will deliver me from these evils?\u201d Diogenes, who had come to visit\nhim, \u201cThis,\u201d said he, presenting him a knife, \u201csoon enough, if thou\nwilt.\u201d--\u201cI do not mean from my life,\u201d he replied, \u201cbut from my\nsufferings.\u201d  The sufferings that only attack the mind, I am not so\nsensible of as most other men; and this partly out of judgment, for the\nworld looks upon several things as dreadful or to be avoided at the\nexpense of life, that are almost indifferent to me: partly, through a\ndull and insensible complexion I have in accidents which do not\npoint-blank hit me; and that insensibility I look upon as one of the best\nparts of my natural condition; but essential and corporeal pains I am\nvery sensible of.  And yet, having long since foreseen them, though with\na sight weak and delicate and softened with the long and happy health and\nquiet that God has been pleased to give me the greatest part of my time,\nI had in my imagination fancied them so insupportable, that, in truth, I\nwas more afraid than I have since found I had cause: by which I am still\nmore fortified in this belief, that most of the faculties of the soul, as\nwe employ them, more trouble the repose of life than they are any way\nuseful to it.\n\nI am in conflict with the worst, the most sudden, the most painful, the\nmost mortal, and the most irremediable of all diseases; I have already\nhad the trial of five or six very long and very painful fits; and yet I\neither flatter myself, or there is even in this state what is very well\nto be endured by a man who has his soul free from the fear of death, and\nof the menaces, conclusions, and consequences which physic is ever\nthundering in our ears; but the effect even of pain itself is not so\nsharp and intolerable as to put a man of understanding into rage and\ndespair.  I have at least this advantage by my stone, that what I could\nnot hitherto prevail upon myself to resolve upon, as to reconciling and\nacquainting myself with death, it will perfect; for the more it presses\nupon and importunes me, I shall be so much the less afraid to die.  I had\nalready gone so far as only to love life for life\u2019s sake, but my pain\nwill dissolve this intelligence; and God grant that in the end, should\nthe sharpness of it be once greater than I shall be able to bear, it does\nnot throw me into the other no less vicious extreme to desire and wish to\ndie!\n\n               \u201cSummum nec metuas diem, nec optes:\u201d\n\n          [\u201cNeither to wish, nor fear to die.\u201d  (Or:)\n          \u201cThou shouldest neither fear nor desire the last day.\u201d\n           --Martial, x. 7.]\n\nthey are two passions to be feared; but the one has its remedy much\nnearer at hand than the other.\n\nAs to the rest, I have always found the precept that so rigorously\nenjoins a resolute countenance and disdainful and indifferent comportment\nin the toleration of infirmities to be ceremonial.  Why should\nphilosophy, which only has respect to life and effects, trouble itself\nabout these external appearances?  Let us leave that care to actors and\nmasters of rhetoric, who set so great a value upon our gestures.  Let her\nallow this vocal frailty to disease, if it be neither cordial nor\nstomachic, and permit the ordinary ways of expressing grief by sighs,\nsobs, palpitations, and turning pale, that nature has put out of our\npower; provided the courage be undaunted, and the tones not expressive\nof despair, let her be satisfied.  What matter the wringing of our hands,\nif we do not wring our thoughts?  She forms us for ourselves, not for\nothers; to be, not to seem; let her be satisfied with governing our\nunderstanding, which she has taken upon her the care of instructing;\nthat, in the fury of the colic, she maintain the soul in a condition to\nknow itself, and to follow its accustomed way, contending with, and\nenduring, not meanly truckling under pain; moved and heated, not subdued\nand conquered, in the contention; capable of discourse and other things,\nto a certain degree.  In such extreme accidents, \u2018tis cruelty to require\nso exact a composedness.  \u2018Tis no great matter that we make a wry face,\nif the mind plays its part well: if the body find itself relieved by\ncomplaining let it complain: if agitation ease it, let it tumble and toss\nat pleasure; if it seem to find the disease evaporate (as some physicians\nhold that it helps women in delivery) in making loud outcries, or if this\ndo but divert its torments, let it roar as it will.  Let us not command\nthis voice to sally, but stop it not.  Epicurus, not only forgives his\nsage for crying out in torments, but advises him to it:\n\n          \u201cPugiles etiam, quum feriunt, in jactandis caestibus\n          ingemiscunt, quia profundenda voce omne corpus intenditur,\n          venitque plaga vehementior.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cBoxers also, when they strike, groan in the act, because with the\n     strength of voice the whole body is carried, and the blow comes with\n     the greater vehemence.\u201d--Cicero, Tusc. Quaes., ii. 23.]\n\nWe have enough to do to deal with the disease, without troubling\nourselves with these superfluous rules.\n\nWhich I say in excuse of those whom we ordinarily see impatient in the\nassaults of this malady; for as to what concerns myself, I have passed it\nover hitherto with a little better countenance, and contented myself with\ngroaning without roaring out; not, nevertheless, that I put any great\nconstraint upon myself to maintain this exterior decorum, for I make\nlittle account of such an advantage: I allow herein as much as the pain\nrequires; but either my pains are not so excessive, or I have more than\nordinary patience.  I complain, I confess, and am a little impatient in a\nvery sharp fit, but I do not arrive to such a degree of despair as he who\nwith:\n\n               \u201cEjulatu, questu, gemitu, fremitibus\n               Resonando, multum flebiles voces refert:\u201d\n\n     [\u201cHowling, roaring, groaning with a thousand noises, expressing his\n     torment in a dismal voice.\u201d (Or:) \u201cWailing, complaining, groaning,\n     murmuring much avail lugubrious sounds.\u201d--Verses of Attius, in his\n     Phaloctetes, quoted by Cicero, De Finib., ii.  29; Tusc.  Quaes.,\n     ii. 14.]\n\nI try myself in the depth of my suffering, and have always found that I\nwas in a capacity to speak, think, and give a rational answer as well as\nat any other time, but not so firmly, being troubled and interrupted by\nthe pain.  When I am looked upon by my visitors to be in the greatest\ntorment, and that they therefore forbear to trouble me, I often essay my\nown strength, and myself set some discourse on foot, the most remote I\ncan contrive from my present condition.  I can do anything upon a sudden\nendeavour, but it must not continue long.  Oh, what pity \u2018tis I have not\nthe faculty of that dreamer in Cicero, who dreaming he was lying with a\nwench, found he had discharged his stone in the sheets.  My pains\nstrangely deaden my appetite that way.  In the intervals from this\nexcessive torment, when my ureters only languish without any great dolor,\nI presently feel myself in my wonted state, forasmuch as my soul takes no\nother alarm but what is sensible and corporal, which I certainly owe to\nthe care I have had of preparing myself by meditation against such\naccidents:\n\n                                   \u201cLaborum,\n               Nulla mihi nova nunc facies inopinave surgit;\n               Omnia praecepi, atque animo mecum ante peregi.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cNo new shape of suffering can arise new or unexpected; I have\n     anticipated all, and acted them over beforehand in my mind.\u201d\n      --AEneid, vi. 103.]\n\nI am, however, a little roughly handled for an apprentice, and with a\nsudden and sharp alteration, being fallen in an instant from a very easy\nand happy condition of life into the most uneasy and painful that can be\nimagined.  For besides that it is a disease very much to be feared in\nitself, it begins with me after a more sharp and severe manner than it is\nused to do with other men.  My fits come so thick upon me that I am\nscarcely ever at ease; yet I have hitherto kept my mind so upright that,\nprovided I can still continue it, I find myself in a much better\ncondition of life than a thousand others, who have no fewer nor other\ndisease but what they create to themselves for want of meditation.\n\nThere is a certain sort of crafty humility that springs from presumption,\nas this, for example, that we confess our ignorance in many things, and\nare so courteous as to acknowledge that there are in the works of nature\nsome qualities and conditions that are imperceptible to us, and of which\nour understanding cannot discover the means and causes; by this so honest\nand conscientious declaration we hope to obtain that people shall also\nbelieve us as to those that we say we do understand.  We need not trouble\nourselves to seek out foreign miracles and difficulties; methinks,\namongst the things that we ordinarily see, there are such\nincomprehensible wonders as surpass all difficulties of miracles.  What a\nwonderful thing it is that the drop of seed from which we are produced\nshould carry in itself the impression not only of the bodily form, but\neven of the thoughts and inclinations of our fathers!  Where can that\ndrop of fluid matter contain that infinite number of forms? and how can\nthey carry on these resemblances with so precarious and irregular a\nprocess that the son shall be like his great-grandfather, the nephew like\nhis uncle?  In the family of Lepidus at Rome there were three, not\nsuccessively but by intervals, who were born with the same eye covered\nwith a cartilage.  At Thebes there was a race that carried from their\nmother\u2019s womb the form of the head of a lance, and he who was not born so\nwas looked upon as illegitimate.  And Aristotle says that in a certain\nnation, where the women were in common, they assigned the children to\ntheir fathers by their resemblance.\n\n\u2018Tis to be believed that I derive this infirmity from my father, for he\ndied wonderfully tormented with a great stone in his bladder; he was\nnever sensible of his disease till the sixty-seventh year of his age; and\nbefore that had never felt any menace or symptoms of it, either in his\nreins, sides, or any other part, and had lived, till then, in a happy,\nvigorous state of health, little subject to infirmities, and he continued\nseven years after in this disease, dragging on a very painful end of\nlife.  I was born about five-and-twenty years before his disease seized\nhim, and in the time of his most flourishing and healthful state of body,\nhis third child in order of birth: where could his propension to this\nmalady lie lurking all that while?  And he being then so far from the\ninfirmity, how could that small part of his substance wherewith he made\nme, carry away so great an impression for its share?  and how so\nconcealed, that till five-and-forty years after, I did not begin to be\nsensible of it?  being the only one to this hour, amongst so many\nbrothers and sisters, and all by one mother, that was ever troubled with\nit.  He that can satisfy me in this point, I will believe him in as many\nother miracles as he pleases; always provided that, as their manner is,\nhe do not give me a doctrine much more intricate and fantastic than the\nthing itself for current pay.\n\nLet the physicians a little excuse the liberty I take, for by this same\ninfusion and fatal insinuation it is that I have received a hatred and\ncontempt of their doctrine; the antipathy I have against their art is\nhereditary.  My father lived three-score and fourteen years, my\ngrandfather sixty-nine, my great-grandfather almost fourscore years,\nwithout ever tasting any sort of physic; and, with them, whatever was not\nordinary diet, was instead of a drug.  Physic is grounded upon experience\nand examples: so is my opinion.  And is not this an express and very\nadvantageous experience.  I do not know that they can find me in all\ntheir records three that were born, bred, and died under the same roof,\nwho have lived so long by their conduct.  They must here of necessity\nconfess, that if reason be not, fortune at least is on my side, and with\nphysicians fortune goes a great deal further than reason.  Let them not\ntake me now at a disadvantage; let them not threaten me in the subdued\ncondition wherein I now am; that were treachery.  In truth, I have enough\nthe better of them by these domestic examples, that they should rest\nsatisfied.  Human things are not usually so constant; it has been two\nhundred years, save eighteen, that this trial has lasted, for the first\nof them was born in the year 1402: \u2018tis now, indeed, very good reason\nthat this experience should begin to fail us.  Let them not, therefore,\nreproach me with the infirmities under which I now suffer; is it not\nenough that I for my part have lived seven-and-forty years in good\nhealth? though it should be the end of my career; \u2018tis of the longer\nsort.\n\nMy ancestors had an aversion to physic by some occult and natural\ninstinct; for the very sight of drugs was loathsome to my father.  The\nSeigneur de Gaviac, my uncle by the father\u2019s side, a churchman, and a\nvaletudinary from his birth, and yet who made that crazy life hold out to\nsixty-seven years, being once fallen into a furious fever, it was ordered\nby the physicians he should be plainly told that if he would not make use\nof help (for so they call that which is very often an obstacle), he would\ninfallibly be a dead man.  That good man, though terrified with this\ndreadful sentence, yet replied, \u201cI am then a dead man.\u201d  But God soon\nafter made the prognostic false.  The last of the brothers--there were\nfour of them--and by many years the last, the Sieur de Bussaguet, was the\nonly one of the family who made use of medicine, by reason, I suppose, of\nthe concern he had with the other arts, for he was a councillor in the\ncourt of Parliament, and it succeeded so ill with him, that being in\noutward appearance of the strongest constitution, he yet died long before\nany of the rest, save the Sieur de Saint Michel.\n\n\u2018Tis possible I may have derived this natural antipathy to physic from\nthem; but had there been no other consideration in the case, I would have\nendeavoured to have overcome it; for all these conditions that spring in\nus without reason, are vicious; \u2018tis a kind of disease that we should\nwrestle with.  It may be I had naturally this propension; but I have\nsupported and fortified it by arguments and reasons which have\nestablished in me the opinion I am of.  For I also hate the consideration\nof refusing physic for the nauseous taste.\n\nI should hardly be of that humour who hold health to be worth purchasing\nby all the most painful cauteries and incisions that can be applied.\nAnd, with Epicurus, I conceive that pleasures are to be avoided, if\ngreater pains be the consequence, and pains to be coveted, that will\nterminate in greater pleasures.  Health is a precious thing, and the only\none, in truth, meriting that a man should lay out, not only his time,\nsweat, labour, and goods, but also his life itself to obtain it;\nforasmuch as, without it, life is wearisome and injurious to us:\npleasure, wisdom, learning, and virtue, without it, wither away and\nvanish; and to the most laboured and solid discourses that philosophy\nwould imprint in us to the contrary, we need no more but oppose the image\nof Plato being struck with an epilepsy or apoplexy; and, in this\npresupposition, to defy him to call the rich faculties of his soul to his\nassistance.  All means that conduce to health can neither be too painful\nnor too dear to me.  But I have some other appearances that make me\nstrangely suspect all this merchandise.  I do not deny but that there may\nbe some art in it, that there are not amongst so many works of Nature,\nthings proper for the conservation of health: that is most certain: I\nvery well know there are some simples that moisten, and others that dry;\nI experimentally know that radishes are windy, and senna-leaves purging;\nand several other such experiences I have, as that mutton nourishes me,\nand wine warms me: and Solon said \u201cthat eating was physic against the\nmalady hunger.\u201d  I do not disapprove the use we make of things the earth\nproduces, nor doubt, in the least, of the power and fertility of Nature,\nand of its application to our necessities: I very well see that pikes and\nswallows live by her laws; but I mistrust the inventions of our mind, our\nknowledge and art, to countenance which, we have abandoned Nature and her\nrules, and wherein we keep no bounds nor moderation.  As we call the\npiling up of the first laws that fall into our hands justice, and their\npractice and dispensation very often foolish and very unjust; and as\nthose who scoff at and accuse it, do not, nevertheless, blame that noble\nvirtue itself, but only condemn the abuse and profanation of that sacred\ntitle; so in physic I very much honour that glorious name, its\npropositions, its promises, so useful for the service of mankind; but the\nordinances it foists upon us, betwixt ourselves, I neither honour nor\nesteem.\n\nIn the first place, experience makes me dread it; for amongst all my\nacquaintance, I see no people so soon sick, and so long before they are\nwell, as those who take much physic; their very health is altered and\ncorrupted by their frequent prescriptions.  Physicians are not content to\ndeal only with the sick, but they will moreover corrupt health itself,\nfor fear men should at any time escape their authority.  Do they not,\nfrom a continual and perfect health, draw the argument of some great\nsickness to ensue?  I have been sick often enough, and have always found\nmy sicknesses easy enough to be supported (though I have made trial of\nalmost all sorts), and as short as those of any other, without their\nhelp, or without swallowing their ill-tasting doses.  The health I have\nis full and free, without other rule or discipline than my own custom and\npleasure.  Every place serves me well enough to stay in, for I need no\nother conveniences, when I am sick, than what I must have when I am well.\nI never disturb myself that I have no physician, no apothecary, nor any\nother assistance, which I see most other sick men more afflicted at than\nthey are with their disease.  What!  Do the doctors themselves show us\nmore felicity and duration in their own lives, that may manifest to us\nsome apparent effect of their skill?\n\nThere is not a nation in the world that has not been many ages without\nphysic; and these the first ages, that is to say, the best and most\nhappy; and the tenth part of the world knows nothing of it yet; many\nnations are ignorant of it to this day, where men live more healthful and\nlonger than we do here, and even amongst us the common people live well\nenough without it.  The Romans were six hundred years before they\nreceived it; and after having made trial of it, banished it from the city\nat the instance of Cato the Censor, who made it appear how easy it was to\nlive without it, having himself lived fourscore and five years, and kept\nhis wife alive to an extreme old age, not without physic, but without a\nphysician: for everything that we find to be healthful to life may be\ncalled physic.  He kept his family in health, as Plutarch says if I\nmistake not, with hare\u2019s milk; as Pliny reports,  that the Arcadians\ncured all manner of diseases with that of a cow; and Herodotus says, the\nLybians generally enjoy rare health, by a custom they have, after their\nchildren are arrived to four years of age, to burn and cauterise the\nveins of their head and temples, by which means they cut off all\ndefluxions of rheum for their whole lives.  And the country people of our\nprovince make use of nothing, in all sorts of distempers, but the\nstrongest wine they can get, mixed with a great deal of saffron and\nspice, and always with the same success.\n\nAnd to say the truth, of all this diversity and confusion of\nprescriptions, what other end and effect is there after all, but to purge\nthe belly?  which a thousand ordinary simples will do as well; and I do\nnot know whether such evacuations be so much to our advantage as they\npretend, and whether nature does not require a residence of her\nexcrements to a certain proportion, as wine does of its lees to keep it\nalive: you often see healthful men fall into vomitings and fluxes of the\nbelly by some extrinsic accident, and make a great evacuation of\nexcrements, without any preceding need, or any following benefit, but\nrather with hurt to their constitution.  \u2018Tis from the great Plato, that\nI lately learned, that of three sorts of motions which are natural to us,\npurging is the worst, and that no man, unless he be a fool, ought to take\nanything to that purpose but in the extremest necessity.  Men disturb and\nirritate the disease by contrary oppositions; it must be the way of\nliving that must gently dissolve, and bring it to its end.  The violent\ngripings and contest betwixt the drug and the disease are ever to our\nloss, since the combat is fought within ourselves, and that the drug is\nan assistant not to be trusted, being in its own nature an enemy to our\nhealth, and by trouble having only access into our condition.  Let it\nalone a little; the general order of things that takes care of fleas and\nmoles, also takes care of men, if they will have the same patience that\nfleas and moles have, to leave it to itself.  \u2018Tis to much purpose we cry\nout \u201cBihore,\u201d--[A term used by the Languedoc waggoners to hasten their\nhorses]--\u2018tis a way to make us hoarse, but not to hasten the matter.\n\u2018Tis a proud and uncompassionate order: our fears, our despair displease\nand stop it from, instead of inviting it to, our relief; it owes its\ncourse to the disease, as well as to health; and will not suffer itself\nto be corrupted in favour of the one to the prejudice of the other\u2019s\nright, for it would then fall into disorder.  Let us, in God\u2019s name,\nfollow it; it leads those that follow, and those who will not follow, it\ndrags along, both their fury and physic together.  Order a purge for your\nbrain, it will there be much better employed than upon your stomach.\n\nOne asking a Lacedaemonian what had made him live so long, he made\nanswer, \u201cthe ignorance of physic\u201d; and the Emperor Adrian continually\nexclaimed as he was dying, that the crowd of physicians had killed him.\nA bad wrestler turned physician: \u201cCourage,\u201d says Diogenes to him; \u201cthou\nhast done well, for now thou will throw those who have formerly thrown\nthee.\u201d  But they have this advantage, according to Nicocles, that the sun\ngives light to their success and the earth covers their failures.  And,\nbesides, they have a very advantageous way of making use of all sorts of\nevents: for what fortune, nature, or any other cause (of which the number\nis infinite), products of good and healthful in us, it is the privilege\nof physic to attribute to itself; all the happy successes that happen to\nthe patient, must be thence derived; the accidents that have cured me,\nand a thousand others, who do not employ physicians, physicians usurp to\nthemselves: and as to ill accidents, they either absolutely disown them,\nin laying the fault upon the patient, by such frivolous reasons as they\nare never at a loss for; as \u201che lay with his arms out of bed,\u201d or \u201che was\ndisturbed with the rattling of a coach:\u201d\n\n                        \u201cRhedarum transitus arcto\n                         Vicorum inflexu:\u201d\n\n               [\u201cThe passage of the wheels in the narrow\n               turning of the street\u201d--Juvenal, iii. 236.]\n\nor \u201csomebody had set open the casement,\u201d or \u201che had lain upon his left\nside,\u201d or \u201che had some disagreeable fancies in his head\u201d: in sum, a word,\na dream, or a look, seems to them excuse sufficient wherewith to palliate\ntheir own errors: or, if they so please, they even make use of our\ngrowing worse, and do their business in this way which can never fail\nthem: which is by buzzing us in the ear, when the disease is more\ninflamed by their medicaments, that it had been much worse but for those\nremedies; he, whom from an ordinary cold they have thrown into a double\ntertian-ague, had but for them been in a continued fever.  They do not\nmuch care what mischief they do, since it turns to their own profit.\nIn earnest, they have reason to require a very favourable belief from\ntheir patients; and, indeed, it ought to be a very easy one, to swallow\nthings so hard to be believed.  Plato said very well, that physicians\nwere the only men who might lie at pleasure, since our health depends\nupon the vanity and falsity of their promises.\n\nAEsop, a most excellent author, and of whom few men discover all the\ngraces, pleasantly represents to us the tyrannical authority physicians\nusurp over poor creatures, weakened and subdued by sickness and fear,\nwhen he tells us, that a sick person, being asked by his physician what\noperation he found of the potion he had given him: \u201cI have sweated very\nmuch,\u201d says the sick man.  \u201cThat\u2019s good,\u201d says the physician.  Another\ntime, having asked how he felt himself after his physic: \u201cI have been\nvery cold, and have had a great shivering upon me,\u201d said he.  \u201cThat is\ngood,\u201d replied the physician.  After the third potion, he asked him again\nhow he did: \u201cWhy, I find myself swollen and puffed up,\u201d said he, \u201cas if\nI had a dropsy.\u201d--\u201cThat is very well,\u201d said the physician.  One of his\nservants coming presently after to inquire how he felt himself, \u201cTruly,\nfriend,\u201d said he, \u201cwith being too well I am about to die.\u201d\n\nThere was a more just law in Egypt, by which the physician, for the three\nfirst days, was to take charge of his patient at the patient\u2019s own risk\nand cost; but, those three days being past, it was to be at his own.  For\nwhat reason is it that their patron, AEsculapius, should be struck with\nthunder for restoring Hippolitus from death to life:\n\n         \u201cNam Pater omnipotens, aliquem indignatus ab umbris\n          Mortalem infernis ad lumina surgere vitae,\n          Ipse repertorem medicinae talis, et artis\n          Fulmine Phoebigenam Stygias detrusit ad undas;\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThen the Almighty Father, offended that any mortal should rise to\n     the light of life from the infernal shades, struck the son of\n     Phoebus with his forked lightning to the Stygian lake.\u201d\n      --AEneid, vii. 770.]\n\nand his followers be pardoned, who send so many souls from life to death?\nA physician, boasting to Nicocles that his art was of great authority:\n\u201cIt is so, indeed,\u201d said Nicocles, \u201cthat can with impunity kill so many\npeople.\u201d\n\nAs to what remains, had I been of their counsel, I would have rendered my\ndiscipline more sacred and mysterious; they begun well, but they have not\nended so.  It was a good beginning to make gods and demons the authors of\ntheir science, and to have used a peculiar way of speaking and writing,\nnotwithstanding that philosophy concludes it folly to persuade a man to\nhis own good by an unintelligible way:  \u201cUt si quis medicus imperet, ut\nsumat:\u201d\n\n\n     \u201cTerrigenam, herbigradam, domiportam, sanguine cassam.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cDescribing it by the epithets of an animal trailing with its slime\n     over the herbage, without blood or bones, and carrying its house\n     upon its back, meaning simply a snail.\u201d--Coste]\n\nIt was a good rule in their art, and that accompanies all other vain,\nfantastic, and supernatural arts, that the patient\u2019s belief should\nprepossess them with good hope and assurance of their effects and\noperation: a rule they hold to that degree, as to maintain that the most\ninexpert and ignorant physician is more proper for a patient who has\nconfidence in him, than the most learned and experienced whom he is not\nso acquainted with.  Nay, even the very choice of most of their drugs is\nin some sort mysterious and divine; the left foot of a tortoise, the\nurine of a lizard, the dung of an elephant, the liver of a mole, blood\ndrawn from under the right wing of a white pigeon; and for us who have\nthe stone (so scornfully they use us in our miseries) the excrement of\nrats beaten to powder, and such like trash and fooleries which rather\ncarry a face of magical enchantment than of any solid science.  I omit\nthe odd number of their pills, the destination of certain days and feasts\nof the year, the superstition of gathering their simples at certain\nhours, and that so austere and very wise countenance and carriage which\nPliny himself so much derides.  But they have, as I said, failed in that\nthey have not added to this fine beginning the making their meetings and\nconsultations more religious and secret, where no profane person should\nhave admission, no more than in the secret ceremonies of AEsculapius; for\nby the reason of this it falls out that their irresolution, the weakness\nof their arguments, divinations and foundations, the sharpness of their\ndisputes, full of hatred, jealousy, and self-consideration, coming to be\ndiscovered by every one, a man must be marvellously blind not to see that\nhe runs a very great hazard in their hands.  Who ever saw one physician\napprove of another\u2019s prescription, without taking something away, or\nadding something to it? by which they sufficiently betray their tricks,\nand make it manifest to us that they therein more consider their own\nreputation, and consequently their profit, than their patient\u2019s interest.\nHe was a much wiser man of their tribe, who of old gave it as a rule,\nthat only one physician should undertake a sick person; for if he do\nnothing to purpose, one single man\u2019s default can bring no great scandal\nupon the art of medicine; and, on the contrary, the glory will be great\nif he happen to have success; whereas, when there are many, they at every\nturn bring a disrepute upon their calling, forasmuch as they oftener do\nhurt than good.  They ought to be satisfied with the perpetual\ndisagreement which is found in the opinions of the principal masters and\nancient authors of this science, which is only known to men well read,\nwithout discovering to the vulgar the controversies and various judgments\nwhich they still nourish and continue amongst themselves.\n\nWill you have one example of the ancient controversy in physic?\nHerophilus lodges the original cause of all diseases in the humours;\nErasistratus, in the blood of the arteries; Asclepiades, in the invisible\natoms of the pores; Alcmaeon, in the exuberance or defect of our bodily\nstrength; Diocles, in the inequality of the elements of which the body is\ncomposed, and in the quality of the air we breathe; Strato, in the\nabundance, crudity, and corruption of the nourishment we take; and\nHippocrates lodges it in the spirits.  There is a certain friend of\ntheirs,--[Celsus, Preface to the First Book.]--whom they know better\nthan I, who declares upon this subject, \u201cthat the most important science\nin practice amongst us, as that which is intrusted with our health and\nconservation, is, by ill luck, the most uncertain, the most perplexed,\nand agitated with the greatest mutations.\u201d  There is no great danger in\nour mistaking the height of the sun, or the fraction of some astronomical\nsupputation; but here, where our whole being is concerned, \u2018tis not\nwisdom to abandon ourselves to the mercy of the agitation of so many\ncontrary winds.\n\nBefore the Peloponnesian war there was no great talk of this science.\nHippocrates brought it into repute; whatever he established, Chrysippus\noverthrew; after that, Erasistratus, Aristotle\u2019s grandson, overthrew what\nChrysippus had written; after these, the Empirics started up, who took a\nquite contrary way to the ancients in the management of this art; when\nthe credit of these began a little to decay, Herophilus set another sort\nof practice on foot, which Asclepiades in turn stood up against, and\noverthrew; then, in their turn, the opinions first of Themiso, and then\nof Musa, and after that those of Vectius Valens, a physician famous\nthrough the intelligence he had with Messalina, came in vogue; the empire\nof physic in Nero\u2019s time was established in Thessalus, who abolished and\ncondemned all that had been held till his time; this man\u2019s doctrine was\nrefuted by Crinas of Marseilles, who first brought all medicinal\noperations under the Ephemerides and motions of the stars, and reduced\neating, sleeping, and drinking to hours that were most pleasing to\nMercury and the moon; his authority was soon after supplanted by\nCharinus, a physician of the same city of Marseilles, a man who not only\ncontroverted all the ancient methods of physic, but moreover the usage of\nhot baths, that had been generally and for so many ages in common use; he\nmade men bathe in cold water, even in winter, and plunged his sick\npatients in the natural waters of streams.  No Roman till Pliny\u2019s time\nhad ever vouchsafed to practise physic; that office was only performed\nby Greeks and foreigners, as \u2018tis now amongst us French, by those who\nsputter Latin; for, as a very great physician says, we do not easily\naccept the medicine we understand, no more than we do the drugs we\nourselves gather.  If the nations whence we fetch our guaiacum,\nsarsaparilla, and China wood, have physicians, how great a value must we\nimagine, by the same recommendation of strangeness, rarity, and dear\npurchase, do they set upon our cabbage and parsley?  for who would dare\nto contemn things so far fetched, and sought out at the hazard of so long\nand dangerous a voyage?\n\nSince these ancient mutations in physic, there have been infinite others\ndown to our own times, and, for the most part, mutations entire and\nuniversal, as those, for example, produced by Paracelsus, Fioravanti, and\nArgentier; for they, as I am told, not only alter one recipe, but the\nwhole contexture and rules of the body of physic, accusing all others of\nignorance and imposition who have practised before them.  At this rate,\nin what a condition the poor patient must be, I leave you to judge.\n\nIf we were even assured that, when they make a mistake, that mistake of\ntheirs would do us no harm, though it did us no good, it were a\nreasonable bargain to venture the making ourselves better without any\ndanger of being made worse.  AEsop tells a story, that one who had bought\na Morisco slave, believing that his black complexion had arrived by\naccident and the ill usage of his former master, caused him to enter with\ngreat care into a course of baths and potions: it happened that the Moor\nwas nothing amended in his tawny complexion, but he wholly lost his\nformer health.  How often do we see physicians impute the death of their\npatients to one another?  I remember that some years ago there was an\nepidemical disease, very dangerous and for the most part mortal, that\nraged in the towns about us: the storm being over which had swept away an\ninfinite number of men, one of the most famous physicians of all the\ncountry, presently after published a book upon that subject, wherein,\nupon better thoughts, he confesses that the letting blood in that disease\nwas the principal cause of so many mishaps.  Moreover, their authors hold\nthat there is no physic that has not something hurtful in it.  And if\neven those of the best operation in some measure offend us, what must\nthose do that are totally misapplied?  For my own part, though there were\nnothing else in the case, I am of opinion, that to those who loathe the\ntaste of physic, it must needs be a dangerous and prejudicial endeavour\nto force it down at so incommodious a time, and with so much aversion,\nand believe that it marvellously distempers a sick person at a time when\nhe has so much need of repose.  And more over, if we but consider the\noccasions upon which they usually ground the cause of our diseases, they\nare so light and nice, that I thence conclude a very little error in the\ndispensation of their drugs may do a great deal of mischief.  Now, if the\nmistake of a physician be so dangerous, we are in but a scurvy condition;\nfor it is almost impossible but he must often fall into those mistakes:\nhe had need of too many parts, considerations, and circumstances, rightly\nto level his design: he must know the sick person\u2019s complexion, his\ntemperament, his humours, inclinations, actions, nay, his very thoughts\nand imaginations; he must be assured of the external circumstances, of\nthe nature of the place, the quality of the air and season, the situation\nof the planets, and their influences: he must know in the disease, the\ncauses, prognostics, affections, and critical days; in the drugs, the\nweight, the power of working, the country, figure, age, and dispensation,\nand he must know how rightly to proportion and mix them together, to\nbeget a just and perfect symmetry; wherein if there be the least error,\nif amongst so many springs there be but any one out of order, \u2018tis enough\nto destroy us.  God knows with how great difficulty most of these things\nare to be understood: for (for example) how shall the physician find out\nthe true sign of the disease, every disease being capable of an infinite\nnumber of indications?  How many doubts and controversies have they\namongst themselves upon the interpretation of urines? otherwise, whence\nshould the continual debates we see amongst them about the knowledge of\nthe disease proceed? how could we excuse the error they so oft fall into,\nof taking fox for marten?  In the diseases I have had, though there were\never so little difficulty in the case, I never found three of one\nopinion: which I instance, because I love to introduce examples wherein I\nam myself concerned.\n\nA gentleman at Paris was lately cut for the stone by order of the\nphysicians, in whose bladder, being accordingly so cut, there was found\nno more stone than in the palm of his hand; and in the same place a\nbishop, who was my particular friend, having been earnestly pressed by\nthe majority of the physicians whom he consulted, to suffer himself to be\ncut, to which also, upon their word, I used my interest to persuade him,\nwhen he was dead and opened, it appeared that he had no malady but in the\nkidneys.  They are least excusable for any error in this disease, by\nreason that it is in some sort palpable; and \u2018tis thence that I conclude\nsurgery to be much more certain, by reason that it sees and feels what it\ndoes, and so goes less upon conjecture; whereas the physicians have no\n\u2018speculum matricis\u2019, by which to examine our brains, lungs, and liver.\n\nEven the very promises of physic are incredible in themselves; for,\nhaving to provide against divers and contrary accidents that often\nafflict us at one and the same time, and that have almost a necessary\nrelation, as the heat of the liver and the coldness of the stomach, they\nwill needs persuade us, that of their ingredients one will heat the\nstomach and the other will cool the liver: one has its commission to go\ndirectly to the kidneys, nay, even to the bladder, without scattering its\noperations by the way, and is to retain its power and virtue through all\nthose turns and meanders, even to the place to the service of which it is\ndesigned, by its own occult property this will dry-the brain; that will\nmoisten the lungs.  Of all this bundle of things having mixed up a\npotion, is it not a kind of madness to imagine or to hope that these\ndiffering virtues should separate themselves from one another in this\nmixture and confusion, to perform so many various errands?  I should very\nmuch fear that they would either lose or change their tickets, and\ndisturb one another\u2019s quarters.  And who can imagine but that, in this\nliquid confusion, these faculties must corrupt, confound, and spoil one\nanother?  And is not the danger still more when the making up of this\nmedicine is entrusted to the skill and fidelity of still another, to\nwhose mercy we again abandon our lives?\n\nAs we have doublet and breeches-makers, distinct trades, to clothe us,\nand are so much the better fitted, seeing that each of them meddles only\nwith his own business, and has less to trouble his head with than the\ntailor who undertakes all; and as in matter of diet, great persons, for\ntheir better convenience, and to the end they may be better served, have\ncooks for the different offices, this for soups and potages, that for\nroasting, instead of which if one cook should undertake the whole\nservice, he could not so well perform it; so also as to the cure of our\nmaladies.  The Egyptians had reason to reject this general trade of\nphysician, and to divide the profession: to each disease, to each part of\nthe body, its particular workman; for that part was more properly and\nwith less confusion cared for, seeing the person looked to nothing else.\nOurs are not aware that he who provides for all, provides for nothing;\nand that the entire government of this microcosm is more than they are\nable to undertake.  Whilst they were afraid of stopping a dysentery, lest\nthey should put the patient into a fever, they killed me a friend,\n--[Estienne de la Boetie.]--who was worth more than the whole of them.\nThey counterpoise their own divinations with the present evils; and\nbecause they will not cure the brain to the prejudice of the stomach,\nthey injure both with their dissentient and tumultuary drugs.\n\nAs to the variety and weakness of the rationale of this art, they are\nmore manifest in it than in any other art; aperitive medicines are proper\nfor a man subject to the stone, by reason that opening and dilating the\npassages they help forward the slimy matter whereof gravel and stone are\nengendered, and convey that downward which begins to harden and gather in\nthe reins; aperitive things are dangerous for a man subject to the stone,\nby reason that, opening and dilating the passages, they help forward the\nmatter proper to create the gravel toward the reins, which by their own\npropension being apt to seize it, \u2018tis not to be imagined but that a\ngreat deal of what has been conveyed thither must remain behind;\nmoreover, if the medicine happen to meet with anything too large to be\ncarried through all the narrow passages it must pass to be expelled, that\nobstruction, whatever it is, being stirred by these aperitive things and\nthrown into those narrow passages, coming to stop them, will occasion a\ncertain and most painful death.  They have the like uniformity in the\ncounsels they give us for the regimen of life: it is good to make water\noften; for we experimentally see that, in letting it lie long in the\nbladder, we give it time to settle the sediment, which will concrete into\na stone; it is good not to make water often, for the heavy excrements it\ncarries along with it will not be voided without violence, as we see by\nexperience that a torrent that runs with force washes the ground it rolls\nover much cleaner than the course of a slow and tardy stream; so, it is\ngood to have often to do with women, for that opens the passages and\nhelps to evacuate gravel; it is also very ill to have often to do with\nwomen, because it heats, tires, and weakens the reins.  It is good to\nbathe frequently in hot water, forasmuch as that relaxes and mollifies\nthe places where the gravel and stone lie; it is also ill by reason that\nthis application of external heat helps the reins to bake, harden, and\npetrify the matter so disposed.  For those who are taking baths it is\nmost healthful.  To eat little at night, to the end that the waters they\nare to drink the next morning may have a better operation upon an empty\nstomach; on the other hand, it is better to eat little at dinner, that it\nhinder not the operation of the waters, while it is not yet perfect, and\nnot to oppress the stomach so soon after the other labour, but leave the\noffice of digestion to the night, which will much better perform it than\nthe day, when the body and soul are in perpetual moving and action.  Thus\ndo they juggle and trifle in all their discourses at our expense; and\nthey could not give me one proposition against which I should not know\nhow to raise a contrary of equal force.  Let them, then, no longer\nexclaim against those who in this trouble of sickness suffer themselves\nto be gently guided by their own appetite and the advice of nature, and\ncommit themselves to the common fortune.\n\nI have seen in my travels almost all the famous baths of Christendom, and\nfor some years past have begun to make use of them myself: for I look\nupon bathing as generally wholesome, and believe that we suffer no little\ninconveniences in our health by having left off the custom that was\ngenerally observed, in former times, almost by all nations, and is yet in\nmany, of bathing every day; and I cannot imagine but that we are much the\nworse by, having our limbs crusted and our pores stopped with dirt.  And\nas to the drinking of them, fortune has in the first place rendered them\nnot at all unacceptable to my taste; and secondly, they are natural and\nsimple, which at least carry no danger with them, though they may do us\nno good, of which the infinite crowd of people of all sorts and\ncomplexions who repair thither I take to be a sufficient warranty; and\nalthough I have not there observed any extraordinary and miraculous\neffects, but that on the contrary, having more narrowly than ordinary\ninquired into it, I have found all the reports of such operations that\nhave been spread abroad in those places ill-grounded and false, and those\nthat believe them (as people are willing to be gulled in what they\ndesire) deceived in them, yet I have seldom known any who have been made\nworse by those waters, and a man cannot honestly deny but that they beget\na better appetite, help digestion, and do in some sort revive us, if we\ndo not go too late and in too weak a condition, which I would dissuade\nevery one from doing.  They have not the virtue to raise men from\ndesperate and inveterate diseases, but they may help some light\nindisposition, or prevent some threatening alteration.  He who does not\nbring along with him so much cheerfulness as to enjoy the pleasure of the\ncompany he will there meet, and of the walks and exercises to which the\namenity of those places invite us, will doubtless lose the best and\nsurest part of their effect.  For this reason I have hitherto chosen to\ngo to those of the most pleasant situation, where there was the best\nconveniency of lodging, provision, and company, as the baths of Bagneres\nin France, those of Plombieres on the frontiers of Germany and Lorraine,\nthose of Baden in Switzerland, those of Lucca in Tuscany, and especially\nthose of Della Villa, which I have the most and at various seasons\nfrequented.\n\nEvery nation has particular opinions touching their use, and particular\nrules and methods in using them; and all of them, according to what I\nhave seen, almost with like effect.  Drinking them is not at all received\nin Germany; the Germans bathe for all diseases, and will lie dabbling in\nthe water almost from sun to sun; in Italy, where they drink nine days,\nthey bathe at least thirty, and commonly drink the water mixed with some\nother drugs to make it work the better.  Here we are ordered to walk to\ndigest it; there we are kept in bed after taking it till it be wrought\noff, our stomachs and feet having continually hot cloths applied to them\nall the while; and as the Germans have a particular practice generally to\nuse cupping and scarification in the bath, so the Italians have their\n\u2018doccie\u2019, which are certain little streams of this hot water brought\nthrough pipes, and with these bathe an hour in the morning, and as much\nin the afternoon, for a month together, either the head, stomach, or any\nother part where the evil lies.  There are infinite other varieties of\ncustoms in every country, or rather there is no manner of resemblance to\none another.  By this you may see that this little part of physic to\nwhich I have only submitted, though the least depending upon art of all\nothers, has yet a great share of the confusion and uncertainty everywhere\nelse manifest in the profession.\n\nThe poets put what they would say with greater emphasis and grace;\nwitness these two epigrams:\n\n              \u201cAlcon hesterno signum Jovis attigit: ille,\n               Quamvis marmoreus, vim patitur medici.\n               Ecce hodie, jussus transferri ex aeede vetusta,\n               Effertur, quamvis sit Deus atque lapis.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cAlcon yesterday touched Jove\u2019s statue; he, although marble,\n     suffers the force of the physician: to-day ordered to be transferred\n     from the old temple, where it stood, it is carried out, although it\n     be a god and a stone.\u201d--Ausonius, Ep., 74.]\n\n\nand the other:\n\n              \u201cLotus nobiscum est, hilaris coenavit; et idem\n               Inventus mane est mortuus Andragoras.\n               Tam subitae mortis causam, Faustine, requiris?\n               In somnis medicum viderat Hermocratem:\u201d\n\n     [\u201cAndragoras bathed with us, supped gaily, and in the morning the\n     same was found dead.  Dost thou ask, Faustinus, the cause of this so\n     sudden death?  In his dreams he had seen the physician Hermocrates.\u201d\n      --Martial, vi. 53.]\n\nupon which I will relate two stories.\n\nThe Baron de Caupene in Chalosse and I have betwixt us the advowson of a\nbenefice of great extent, at the foot of our mountains, called Lahontan.\nIt is with the inhabitants of this angle, as \u2018tis said of those of the\nVal d\u2019Angrougne; they lived a peculiar sort of life, their fashions,\nclothes, and manners distinct from other people; ruled and governed by\ncertain particular laws and usages, received from father to son, to which\nthey submitted, without other constraint than the reverence to custom.\nThis little state had continued from all antiquity in so happy a\ncondition, that no neighbouring judge was ever put to the trouble of\ninquiring into their doings; no advocate was ever retained to give them\ncounsel, no stranger ever called in to compose their differences; nor was\never any of them seen to go a-begging.  They avoided all alliances and\ntraffic with the outer world, that they might not corrupt the purity of\ntheir own government; till, as they say, one of them, in the memory of\nman, having a mind spurred on with a noble ambition, took it into his\nhead, to bring his name into credit and reputation, to make one of his\nsons something more than ordinary, and having put him to learn to write\nin a neighbouring town, made him at last a brave village notary.  This\nfellow, having acquired such dignity, began to disdain their ancient\ncustoms, and to buzz into the people\u2019s ears the pomp of the other parts\nof the nation; the first prank he played was to advise a friend of his,\nwhom somebody had offended by sawing off the horns of one of his goats,\nto make his complaint to the royal judges thereabout, and so he went on\nfrom one to another, till he had spoiled and confounded all.  In the tail\nof this corruption, they say, there happened another, and of worse\nconsequence, by means of a physician, who, falling in love with one of\ntheir daughters, had a mind to marry her and to live amongst them.  This\nman first of all began to teach them the names of fevers, colds, and\nimposthumes; the seat of the heart, liver, and intestines, a science till\nthen utterly unknown to them; and instead of garlic, with which they were\nwont to cure all manner of diseases, how painful or extreme soever, he\ntaught them, though it were but for a cough or any little cold, to take\nstrange mixtures, and began to make a trade not only of their health, but\nof their lives.  They swear till then they never perceived the evening\nair to be offensive to the head; that to drink when they were hot was\nhurtful, and that the winds of autumn were more unwholesome than those of\nspring; that, since this use of physic, they find themselves oppressed\nwith a legion of unaccustomed diseases, and that they perceive a general\ndecay in their ancient vigour, and their lives are cut shorter by the\nhalf.  This is the first of my stories.\n\nThe other is, that before I was afflicted with the stone, hearing that\nthe blood of a he-goat was with many in very great esteem, and looked\nupon as a celestial manna rained down upon these latter ages for the good\nand preservation of the lives of men, and having heard it spoken of by\nmen of understanding for an admirable drug, and of infallible operation;\nI, who have ever thought myself subject to all the accidents that can\nbefall other men, had a mind, in my perfect health, to furnish myself\nwith this miracle, and therefore gave order to have a goat fed at home\naccording to the recipe: for he must be taken in the hottest month of all\nsummer, and must only have aperitive herbs given him to eat, and white\nwine to drink.  I came home by chance the very day he was to be killed;\nand some one came and told me that the cook had found two or three great\nballs in his paunch, that rattled against one another amongst what he had\neaten.  I was curious to have all his entrails brought before me, where,\nhaving caused the skin that enclosed them to be cut, there tumbled out\nthree great lumps, as light as sponges, so that they appeared to be\nhollow, but as to the rest, hard and firm without, and spotted and mixed\nall over with various dead colours; one was perfectly round, and of the\nbigness of an ordinary ball; the other two something less, of an\nimperfect roundness, as seeming not to be arrived at their, full growth.\nI find, by inquiry of people accustomed to open these animals, that it is\na rare and unusual accident.  \u2018Tis likely these are stones of the same\nnature with ours and if so, it must needs be a very vain hope in\nthose who have the stone, to extract their cure from the blood of a beast\nthat was himself about to die of the same disease.  For to say that the\nblood does not participate of this contagion, and does not thence alter\nits wonted virtue, it is rather to be believed that nothing is engendered\nin a body but by the conspiracy and communication of all the parts: the\nwhole mass works together, though one part contributes more to the work\nthan another, according to the diversity of operations; wherefore it is\nvery likely that there was some petrifying quality in all the parts of\nthis goat.  It was not so much for fear of the future, and for myself,\nthat I was curious in this experiment, but because it falls out in mine,\nas it does in many other families, that the women store up such little\ntrumperies for the service of the people, using the same recipe in fifty\nseveral diseases, and such a recipe as they will not take themselves, and\nyet triumph when they happen to be successful.\n\nAs to what remains, I honour physicians, not according to the precept\nfor their necessity (for to this passage may be opposed another of the\nprophet reproving King Asa for having recourse to a physician), but for\nthemselves, having known many very good men of that profession, and most\nworthy to be beloved.  I do not attack them; \u2018tis their art I inveigh\nagainst, and do not much blame them for making their advantage of our\nfolly, for most men do the same.  Many callings, both of greater and of\nless dignity than theirs, have no other foundation or support than public\nabuse.  When I am sick I send for them if they be near, only to have\ntheir company, and pay them as others do.  I give them leave to command\nme to keep myself warm, because I naturally love to do it, and to appoint\nleeks or lettuce for my broth; to order me white wine or claret; and so\nas to all other things, which are indifferent to my palate and custom.\nI know very well that I do nothing for them in so doing, because\nsharpness and strangeness are incidents of the very essence of physic.\nLycurgus ordered wine for the sick Spartans.  Why?  because they\nabominated the drinking it when they were well; as a gentleman, a\nneighbour of mine, takes it as an excellent medicine in his fever,\nbecause naturally he mortally hates the taste of it.  How many do we see\namongst them of my humour, who despise taking physic themselves, are men\nof a liberal diet, and live a quite contrary sort of life to what they\nprescribe others?  What is this but flatly to abuse our simplicity?  for\ntheir own lives and health are no less dear to them than ours are to us,\nand consequently they would accommodate their practice to their rules, if\nthey did not themselves know how false these are.\n\n\u2018Tis the fear of death and of pain, impatience of disease, and a violent\nand indiscreet desire of a present cure, that so blind us: \u2018tis pure\ncowardice that makes our belief so pliable and easy to be imposed upon:\nand yet most men do not so much believe as they acquiesce and permit; for\nI hear them find fault and complain as well as we; but they resolve at\nlast, \u201cWhat should I do then?\u201d  As if impatience were of itself a better\nremedy than patience.  Is there any one of those who have suffered\nthemselves to be persuaded into this miserable subjection, who does not\nequally surrender himself to all sorts of impostures?  who does not give\nup himself to the mercy of whoever has the impudence to promise him a\ncure?  The Babylonians carried their sick into the public square; the\nphysician was the people: every one who passed by being in humanity and\ncivility obliged to inquire of their condition, gave some advice\naccording to his own experience.  We do little better; there is not so\nsimple a woman, whose gossips and drenches we do not make use of: and\naccording to my humour, if I were to take physic, I would sooner choose\nto take theirs than any other, because at least, if they do no good, they\nwill do no harm.  What Homer and Plato said of the Egyptians, that they\nwere all physicians, may be said of all nations; there is not a man\namongst any of them who does not boast of some rare recipe, and who will\nnot venture it upon his neighbour, if he will let him.  I was the other\nday in a company where one, I know not who, of my fraternity brought us\nintelligence of a new sort of pills made up of a hundred and odd\ningredients: it made us very merry, and was a singular consolation, for\nwhat rock could withstand so great a battery?  And yet I hear from those\nwho have made trial of it, that the least atom of gravel deigned not to\nstir fort.\n\nI cannot take my hand from the paper before I have added a word\nconcerning the assurance they give us of the certainty of their drugs,\nfrom the experiments they have made.\n\nThe greatest part, I should say above two-thirds of the medicinal\nvirtues, consist in the quintessence or occult property of simples,\nof which we can have no other instruction than use and custom; for\nquintessence is no other than a quality of which we cannot by our reason\nfind out the cause.  In such proofs, those they pretend to have acquired\nby the inspiration of some daemon, I am content to receive (for I meddle\nnot with miracles); and also the proofs which are drawn from things that,\nupon some other account, often fall into use amongst us; as if in the\nwool, wherewith we are wont to clothe ourselves, there has accidentally\nsome occult desiccative property been found out of curing kibed heels, or\nas if in the radish we eat for food there has been found out some\naperitive operation.  Galen reports, that a man happened to be cured of a\nleprosy by drinking wine out of a vessel into which a viper had crept by\nchance.  In this example we find the means and a very likely guide and\nconduct to this experience, as we also do in those that physicians\npretend to have been directed to by the example of some beasts.  But in\nmost of their other experiments wherein they affirm they have been\nconducted by fortune, and to have had no other guide than chance, I find\nthe progress of this information incredible.  Suppose man looking round\nabout him upon the infinite number of things, plants, animals, metals;\nI do not know where he would begin his trial; and though his first fancy\nshould fix him upon an elk\u2019s horn, wherein there must be a very pliant\nand easy belief, he will yet find himself as perplexed in his second\noperation.  There are so many maladies and so many circumstances\npresented to him, that before he can attain the certainty of the point to\nwhich the perfection of his experience should arrive, human sense will be\nat the end of its lesson: and before he can, amongst this infinity of\nthings, find out what this horn is; amongst so many diseases, what is\nepilepsy; the many complexions in a melancholy person; the many seasons\nin winter; the many nations in the French; the many ages in age; the many\ncelestial mutations in the conjunction of Venus and Saturn; the many\nparts in man\u2019s body, nay, in a finger; and being, in all this, directed\nneither by argument, conjecture, example, nor divine inspirations, but\nmerely by the sole motion of fortune, it must be by a perfectly\nartificial, regular and methodical fortune.  And after the cure is\nperformed, how can he assure himself that it was not because the disease\nhad arrived at its period or an effect of chance?  or the operation of\nsomething else that he had eaten, drunk, or touched that day? or by\nvirtue of his grandmother\u2019s prayers?  And, moreover, had this experiment\nbeen perfect, how many times was it repeated, and this long bead-roll of\nhaps, and concurrences strung anew by chance to conclude a certain rule?\nAnd when the rule is concluded, by whom, I pray you?  Of so many\nmillions, there are but three men who take upon them to record their\nexperiments: must fortune needs just hit one of these?  What if another,\nand a hundred others, have made contrary experiments?  We might,\nperadventure, have some light in this, were all the judgments and\narguments of men known to us; but that three witnesses, three doctors,\nshould lord it over all mankind, is against reason: it were necessary\nthat human nature should have deputed and chosen them out, and that they\nwere declared our comptrollers by express procuration:\n\n\n\u201cTO MADAME DE DURAS.\n\n     --[Marguerite de Grammont, widow of Jean de Durfort, Seigneur de\n     Duras, who was killed near Leghorn, leaving no posterity.  Montaigne\n     seems to have been on terms of considerable intimacy with her, and\n     to have tendered her some very wholesome and frank advice in regard\n     to her relations with Henry IV.]--\n\n\u201cMADAME,--The last time you honoured me with a visit, you found me at work\nupon this chapter, and as these trifles may one day fall into your hands,\nI would also that they testify in how great honour the author will take\nany favour you shall please to show them.  You will there find the same\nair and mien you have observed in his conversation; and though I could\nhave borrowed some better or more favourable garb than my own, I would\nnot have done it: for I require nothing more of these writings, but to\npresent me to your memory such as I naturally am.  The same conditions\nand faculties you have been pleased to frequent and receive with much\nmore honour and courtesy than they deserve, I would put together (but\nwithout alteration or change) in one solid body, that may peradventure\ncontinue some years, or some days, after I am gone; where you may find\nthem again when you shall please to refresh your memory, without putting\nyou to any greater trouble; neither are they worth it.  I desire you\nshould continue the favour of your friendship to me, by the same\nqualities by which it was acquired.\n\n\u201cI am not at all ambitious that any one should love and esteem me more\ndead than living.  The humour of Tiberius is ridiculous, but yet common,\nwho was more solicitous to extend his renown to posterity than to render\nhimself acceptable to men of his own time.  If I were one of those to\nwhom the world could owe commendation, I would give out of it one-half to\nhave the other in hand; let their praises come quick and crowding about\nme, more thick than long, more full than durable; and let them cease, in\nGod\u2019s name, with my own knowledge of them, and when the sweet sound can\nno longer pierce my ears.  It were an idle humour to essay, now that I am\nabout to forsake the commerce of men, to offer myself to them by a new\nrecommendation.  I make no account of the goods I could not employ in the\nservice of my life.  Such as I am, I will be elsewhere than in paper: my\nart and industry have been ever directed to render myself good for\nsomething; my studies, to teach me to do, and not to write.  I have made\nit my whole business to frame my life: this has been my trade and my\nwork; I am less a writer of books than anything else.  I have coveted\nunderstanding for the service of my present and real conveniences, and\nnot to lay up a stock for my posterity.  He who has anything of value in\nhim, let him make it appear in his conduct, in his ordinary discourses,\nin his courtships, and his quarrels: in play, in bed, at table, in the\nmanagement of his affairs, in his economics.  Those whom I see make good\nbooks in ill breeches, should first have mended their breeches, if they\nwould have been ruled by me.  Ask a Spartan whether he had rather be a\ngood orator or a good soldier: and if I was asked the same question, I\nwould rather choose to be a good cook, had I not one already to serve me.\nMy God!  Madame, how should I hate such a recommendation of being a\nclever fellow at writing, and an ass and an inanity in everything else!\nYet I had rather be a fool both here and there than to have made so ill a\nchoice wherein to employ my talent.  And I am so far from expecting to\ngain any new reputation by these follies, that I shall think I come off\npretty well if I lose nothing by them of that little I had before.  For\nbesides that this dead and mute painting will take from my natural being,\nit has no resemblance to my better condition, but is much lapsed from my\nformer vigour and cheerfulness, growing faded and withered: I am towards\nthe bottom of the barrel, which begins to taste of the lees.\n\n\u201cAs to the rest, Madame, I should not have dared to make so bold with the\nmysteries of physic, considering the esteem that you and so many others\nhave of it, had I not had encouragement from their own authors.  I think\nthere are of these among the old Latin writers but two, Pliny and Celsus\nif these ever fall into your hands, you will find that they speak much\nmore rudely of their art than I do; I but pinch it, they cut its throat.\nPliny, amongst other things, twits them with this, that when they are at\nthe end of their rope, they have a pretty device to save themselves, by\nrecommending their patients, whom they have teased and tormented with\ntheir drugs and diets to no purpose, some to vows and miracles, others to\nthe hot baths.  (Be not angry, Madame; he speaks not of those in our\nparts, which are under the protection of your house, and all Gramontins.)\nThey have a third way of saving their own credit, of ridding their hands\nof us and securing themselves from the reproaches we might cast in their\nteeth of our little amendment, when they have had us so long in their\nhands that they have not one more invention left wherewith to amuse us,\nwhich is to send us to the better air of some other country.  This,\nMadame, is enough; I hope you will give me leave to return to my\ndiscourse, from which I have so far digressed, the better to divert you.\u201d\n\nIt was, I think, Pericles, who being asked how he did: \u201cYou may judge,\u201d\n says he, \u201cby these,\u201d showing some little scrolls of parchment he had tied\nabout his neck and arms.  By which he would infer that he must needs be\nvery sick when he was reduced to a necessity of having recourse to such\nidle and vain fopperies, and of suffering himself to be so equipped.\nI dare not promise but that I may one day be so much a fool as to commit\nmy life and death to the mercy and government of physicians; I may fall\ninto such a frenzy; I dare not be responsible for my future constancy:\nbut then, if any one ask me how I do, I may also answer, as Pericles did,\n\u201cYou may judge by this,\u201d shewing my hand clutching six drachms of opium.\nIt will be a very evident sign of a violent sickness: my judgment will be\nvery much out of order; if once fear and impatience get such an advantage\nover me, it may very well be concluded that there is a dreadful fever in\nmy mind.\n\nI have taken the pains to plead this cause, which I understand\nindifferently, a little to back and support the natural aversion to drugs\nand the practice of physic I have derived from my ancestors, to the end\nit may not be a mere stupid and inconsiderate aversion, but have a little\nmore form; and also, that they who shall see me so obstinate in my\nresolution against all exhortations and menaces that shall be given me,\nwhen my infirmity shall press hardest upon me, may not think \u2018tis mere\nobstinacy in me; or any one so ill-natured as to judge it to be any\nmotive of glory: for it would be a strange ambition to seek to gain\nhonour by an action my gardener or my groom can perform as well as I.\nCertainly, I have not a heart so tumorous and windy, that I should\nexchange so solid a pleasure as health for an airy and imaginary\npleasure: glory, even that of the Four Sons of Aymon, is too dear bought\nby a man of my humour, if it cost him three swinging fits of the stone.\nGive me health, in God\u2019s name!  Such as love physic, may also have good,\ngreat, and convincing considerations; I do not hate opinions contrary to\nmy own: I am so, far from being angry to see a discrepancy betwixt mine\nand other men\u2019s judgments, and from rendering myself unfit for the\nsociety of men, from being of another sense and party than mine, that on\nthe contrary (the most general way that nature has followed being\nvariety, and more in souls than bodies, forasmuch as they are of a more\nsupple substance, and more susceptible of forms) I find it much more rare\nto see our humours and designs jump and agree.  And there never were, in\nthe world, two opinions alike, no more than two hairs, or two grains:\ntheir most universal quality is diversity.\n\n\n\n\n     ETEXT EDITOR\u2019S BOOKMARKS:\n\n     I am

I would presently\npart with them for what they are worth, and neither buy nor sell them,\nbut as they weigh.  I speak on paper, as I do to the first person I meet;\nand that this is true, observe what follows.\n\nTo whom ought not treachery to be hateful, when Tiberius refused it in a\nthing of so great importance to him?  He had word sent him from Germany\nthat if he thought fit, they would rid him of Arminius by poison: this\nwas the most potent enemy the Romans had, who had defeated them so\nignominiously under Varus, and who alone prevented their aggrandisement\nin those parts.\n\nHe returned answer, \u201cthat the people of Rome were wont to revenge\nthemselves of their enemies by open ways, and with their swords in their\nhands, and not clandestinely and by fraud\u201d: wherein he quitted the\nprofitable for the honest.  You will tell me that he was a braggadocio; I\nbelieve so too: and \u2018tis no great miracle in men of his profession.  But\nthe acknowledgment of virtue is not less valid in the mouth of him who\nhates it, forasmuch as truth forces it from him, and if he will not\ninwardly receive it, he at least puts it on for a decoration.\n\nOur outward and inward structure is full of imperfection; but there is\nnothing useless in nature, not even inutility itself; nothing has\ninsinuated itself into this universe that has not therein some fit and\nproper place.  Our being is cemented with sickly qualities: ambition,\njealousy, envy, revenge, superstition, and despair have so natural a\npossession in us, that its image is discerned in beasts; nay, and\ncruelty, so unnatural a vice; for even in the midst of compassion we feel\nwithin, I know not what tart-sweet titillation of ill-natured pleasure in\nseeing others suffer; and the children feel it:\n\n         \u201cSuave mari magno, turbantibus aequora ventis,\n          E terra magnum alterius spectare laborem:\u201d\n\n     [\u201cIt is sweet, when the winds disturb the waters of the vast sea, to\n     witness from land the peril of other persons.\u201d--Lucretius, ii. I.]\n\nof the seeds of which qualities, whoever should divest man, would destroy\nthe fundamental conditions of human life.  Likewise, in all governments\nthere are necessary offices, not only abject, but vicious also.  Vices\nthere help to make up the seam in our piecing, as poisons are useful for\nthe conservation of health.  If they become excusable because they are of\nuse to us, and that the common necessity covers their true qualities, we\nare to resign this part to the strongest and boldest citizens, who\nsacrifice their honour and conscience, as others of old sacrificed their\nlives, for the good of their country: we, who are weaker, take upon us\nparts both that are more easy and less hazardous.  The public weal\nrequires that men should betray, and lie, and massacre; let us leave this\ncommission to men who are more obedient and more supple.\n\nIn earnest, I have often been troubled to see judges, by fraud and false\nhopes of favour or pardon, allure a criminal to confess his fact, and\ntherein to make use of cozenage and impudence.  It would become justice,\nand Plato himself, who countenances this manner of proceeding, to furnish\nme with other means more suitable to my own liking: this is a malicious\nkind of justice, and I look upon it as no less wounded by itself than by\nothers.  I said not long since to some company in discourse, that I\nshould hardly be drawn to betray my prince for a particular man, who\nshould be much ashamed to betray any particular man for my prince; and I\ndo not only hate deceiving myself, but that any one should deceive\nthrough me; I will neither afford matter nor occasion to any such thing.\n\nIn the little I have had to mediate betwixt our princes--[Between the\nKing of Navarre, afterwards Henry IV., and the Duc de Guise.  See De\nThou, De Vita Sua, iii. 9.]--in the divisions and subdivisions by which\nwe are at this time torn to pieces, I have been very careful that they\nshould neither be deceived in me nor deceive others by me.  People of\nthat kind of trading are very reserved, and pretend to be the most\nmoderate imaginable and nearest to the opinions of those with whom they\nhave to do; I expose myself in my stiff opinion, and after a method the\nmost my own; a tender negotiator, a novice, who had rather fail in the\naffair than be wanting to myself.  And yet it has been hitherto with so\ngood luck (for fortune has doubtless the best share in it), that few\nthings have passed from hand to hand with less suspicion or more favour\nand privacy.  I have a free and open way that easily insinuates itself\nand obtains belief with those with whom I am to deal at the first\nmeeting.  Sincerity and pure truth, in what age soever, pass for current;\nand besides, the liberty and freedom of a man who treats without any\ninterest of his own is never hateful or suspected, and he may very well\nmake use of the answer of Hyperides to the Athenians, who complained of\nhis blunt way of speaking: \u201cMessieurs, do not consider whether or no I am\nfree, but whether I am so without a bribe, or without any advantage to my\nown affairs.\u201d  My liberty of speaking has also easily cleared me from all\nsuspicion of dissembling by its vehemency, leaving nothing unsaid, how\nhome and bitter soever (so that I could have said no worse behind their\nbacks), and in that it carried along with it a manifest show of\nsimplicity and indifference.  I pretend to no other fruit by acting than\nto act, and add to it no long arguments or propositions; every action\nplays its own game, win if it can.\n\nAs to the rest, I am not swayed by any passion, either of love or hatred,\ntowards the great, nor has my will captivated either by particular injury\nor obligation.  I look upon our kings with an affection simply loyal and\nrespectful, neither prompted nor restrained by any private interest, and\nI love myself for it.  Nor does the general and just cause attract me\notherwise than with moderation, and without heat.  I am not subject to\nthose penetrating and close compacts and engagements.  Anger and hatred\nare beyond the duty of justice; and are passions only useful to those who\ndo not keep themselves strictly to their duty by simple reason:\n\n          \u201cUtatur motu animi, qui uti ratione non potest.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cHe may employ his passion, who can make no use of his reason.\u201d\n      --Cicero, Tusc. Quaes., iv. 25.]\n\nAll legitimate intentions are temperate and equable of themselves; if\notherwise, they degenerate into seditious and unlawful.  This is it which\nmakes me walk everywhere with my head erect, my face and my heart open.\nIn truth, and I am not afraid to confess it, I should easily, in case of\nneed, hold up one candle to St. Michael and another to his dragon, like\nthe old woman; I will follow the right side even to the fire, but\nexclusively, if I can.  Let Montaigne be overwhelmed in the public ruin\nif need be; but if there be no need, I should think myself obliged to\nfortune to save me, and I will make use of all the length of line my duty\nallows for his preservation.  Was it not Atticus who, being of the just\nbut losing side, preserved himself by his moderation in that universal\nshipwreck of the world, amongst so many mutations and diversities?  For\nprivate man, as he was, it is more easy; and in such kind of work, I\nthink a man may justly not be ambitious to offer and insinuate himself.\nFor a man, indeed, to be wavering and irresolute, to keep his affection\nunmoved and without inclination in the troubles of his country and public\ndivisions, I neither think it handsome nor honest:\n\n          \u201cEa non media, sed nulla via est, velut eventum\n          exspectantium, quo fortunae consilia sua applicent.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThat is not a middle way, but no way, to await events, by which\n     they refer their resolutions to fortune.\u201d--Livy, xxxii. 21.]\n\nThis may be allowed in our neighbours\u2019 affairs; and thus Gelo, the tyrant\nof Syracuse, suspended his inclination in the war betwixt the Greeks and\nbarbarians, keeping a resident ambassador with presents at Delphos, to\nwatch and see which way fortune would incline, and then take fit occasion\nto fall in with the victors.  It would be a kind of treason to proceed\nafter this manner in our own domestic affairs, wherein a man must of\nnecessity be of the one side or the other; though for a man who has no\noffice or express command to call him out, to sit still I hold it more\nexcusable (and yet I do not excuse myself upon these terms) than in\nforeign expeditions, to which, however, according to our laws, no man is\npressed against his will.  And yet even those who wholly engage\nthemselves in such a war may behave themselves with such temper and\nmoderation, that the storm may fly over their heads without doing them\nany harm.  Had we not reason to hope such an issue in the person of the\nlate Bishop of Orleans, the Sieur de Morvilliers?\n\n     [An able negotiator, who, though protected by the Guises, and\n     strongly supporting them, was yet very far from persecuting the\n     Reformists.  He died 1577.]\n\nAnd I know, amongst those who behave themselves most bravely in the\npresent war, some whose manners are so gentle, obliging, and just, that\nthey will certainly stand firm, whatever event Heaven is preparing for\nus.  I am of opinion that it properly belongs to kings only to quarrel\nwith kings; and I laugh at those spirits who, out of lightness of heart,\nlend themselves to so disproportioned disputes; for a man has never the\nmore particular quarrel with a prince, by marching openly and boldly\nagainst him for his own honour and according to his duty; if he does not\nlove such a person, he does better, he esteems him.  And notably the\ncause of the laws and of the ancient government of a kingdom, has this\nalways annexed to it, that even those who, for their own private\ninterest, invade them, excuse, if they do not honour, the defenders.\n\nBut we are not, as we nowadays do, to call peevishness and inward\ndiscontent, that spring from private interest and passion, duty, nor a\ntreacherous and malicious conduct, courage; they call their proneness to\nmischief and violence zeal; \u2018tis not the cause, but their interest, that\ninflames them; they kindle and begin a war, not because it is just, but\nbecause it is war.\n\nA man may very well behave himself commodiously and loyally too amongst\nthose of the adverse party; carry yourself, if not with the same equal\naffection (for that is capable of different measure), at least with an\naffection moderate, well tempered, and such as shall not so engage you to\none party, that it may demand all you are able to do for that side,\ncontent yourself with a moderate proportion of their, favour and\ngoodwill; and to swim in troubled waters without fishing in them.\n\nThe other way, of offering a man\u2019s self and the utmost service he is able\nto do, both to one party and the other, has still less of prudence in it\nthan conscience.  Does not he to whom you betray another, to whom you\nwere as welcome as to himself, know that you will at another time do as\nmuch for him?  He holds you for a villain; and in the meantime hears what\nyou will say, gathers intelligence from you, and works his own ends out\nof your disloyalty; double-dealing men are useful for bringing in, but we\nmust have a care they carry out as little as is possible.\n\nI say nothing to one party that I may not, upon occasion, say to the\nother, with a little alteration of accent; and report nothing but things\neither indifferent or known, or what is of common consequence.  I cannot\npermit myself, for any consideration, to tell them a lie.  What is\nintrusted to my secrecy, I religiously conceal; but I take as few trusts\nof that nature upon me as I can.  The secrets of princes are a\ntroublesome burthen to such as are not interested in them.  I very\nwillingly bargain that they trust me with little, but confidently rely\nupon what I tell them.  I have ever known more than I desired.  One open\nway of speaking introduces another open way of speaking, and draws out\ndiscoveries, like wine and love.  Philippides, in my opinion, answered\nKing Lysimachus very discreetly, who, asking him what of his estate he\nshould bestow upon him?  \u201cWhat you will,\u201d said he, \u201cprovided it be none\nof your secrets.\u201d  I see every one is displeased if the bottom of the\naffair be concealed from him wherein he is employed, or that there be any\nreservation in the thing; for my part, I am content to know no more of\nthe business than what they would have me employ myself in, nor desire\nthat my knowledge should exceed or restrict what I have to say.  If I\nmust serve for an instrument of deceit, let it be at least with a safe\nconscience: I will not be reputed a servant either so affectionate or so\nloyal as to be fit to betray any one: he who is unfaithful to himself, is\nexcusably so to his master.  But they are princes who do not accept men\nby halves, and despise limited and conditional services: I cannot help\nit: I frankly tell them how far I can go; for a slave I should not be,\nbut to reason, and I can hardly submit even to that.  And they also are\nto blame to exact from a freeman the same subjection and obligation to\ntheir service that they do from him they have made and bought, or whose\nfortune particularly and expressly depends upon theirs.  The laws have\ndelivered me from a great anxiety; they have chosen a side for me, and\ngiven me a master; all other superiority and obligation ought to be\nrelative to that, and cut, off from all other.  Yet this is not to say,\nthat if my affection should otherwise incline me, my hand should\npresently obey it; the will and desire are a law to themselves; but\nactions must receive commission from the public appointment.\n\nAll this proceeding of mine is a little dissonant from the ordinary\nforms; it would produce no great effects, nor be of any long duration;\ninnocence itself could not, in this age of ours, either negotiate without\ndissimulation, or traffic without lying; and, indeed, public employments\nare by no means for my palate: what my profession requires, I perform\nafter the most private manner that I can.  Being young, I was engaged up\nto the ears in business, and it succeeded well; but I disengaged myself\nin good time.  I have often since avoided meddling in it, rarely\naccepted, and never asked it; keeping my back still turned to ambition;\nbut if not like rowers who so advance backward, yet so, at the same time,\nthat I am less obliged to my resolution than to my good fortune, that I\nwas not wholly embarked in it.  For there are ways less displeasing to my\ntaste, and more suitable to my ability, by which, if she had formerly\ncalled me to the public service, and my own advancement towards the\nworld\u2019s opinion, I know I should, in spite of all my own arguments to the\ncontrary, have pursued them.  Such as commonly say, in opposition to what\nI profess, that what I call freedom, simplicity, and plainness in my\nmanners, is art and subtlety, and rather prudence than goodness, industry\nthan nature, good sense than good luck, do me more honour than disgrace:\nbut, certainly, they make my subtlety too subtle; and whoever has\nfollowed me close, and pryed narrowly into me, I will give him the\nvictory, if he does not confess that there is no rule in their school\nthat could match this natural motion, and maintain an appearance of\nliberty and licence, so equal and inflexible, through so many various and\ncrooked paths, and that all their wit and endeavour could never have led\nthem through.  The way of truth is one and simple; that of particular\nprofit, and the commodity of affairs a man is entrusted with, is double,\nunequal, and casual.  I have often seen these counterfeit and artificial\nliberties practised, but, for the most part, without success; they relish\nof AEsop\u2019s ass who, in emulation of the dog, obligingly clapped his two\nfore-feet upon his master\u2019s shoulders; but as many caresses as the dog\nhad for such an expression of kindness, twice so many blows with a cudgel\nhad the poor ass for his compliment:\n\n     \u201cId maxime quemque decet, quod est cujusque suum maxime.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThat best becomes every man which belongs most to him;\u201d\n      --Cicero, De Offic., i. 31.]\n\nI will not deprive deceit of its due; that were but ill to understand the\nworld: I know it has often been of great use, and that it maintains and\nsupplies most men\u2019s employment.  There are vices that are lawful, as\nthere are many actions, either good or excusable, that are not lawful in\nthemselves.\n\nThe justice which in itself is natural and universal is otherwise and\nmore nobly ordered than that other justice which is special, national,\nand constrained to the ends of government,\n\n          \u201cVeri juris germanaeque justitiae solidam et expressam\n          effigiem nullam tenemus; umbra et imaginibus utimur;\u201d\n\n     [\u201cWe retain no solid and express portraiture of true right and\n     germane justice; we have only the shadow and image of it.\u201d\n      --Cicero, De Offic., iii. 17.]\n\ninsomuch that the sage Dandamis, hearing the lives of Socrates,\nPythagoras, and Diogenes read, judged them to be great men every way,\nexcepting that they were too much subjected to the reverence of the laws,\nwhich, to second and authorise, true virtue must abate very much of its\noriginal vigour; many vicious actions are introduced, not only by their\npermission, but by their advice:\n\n     \u201cEx senatus consultis plebisquescitis scelera exercentur.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cCrimes are committed by the decrees of the Senate and the\n     popular assembly.\u201d--Seneca, Ep., 95.]\n\nI follow the common phrase that distinguishes betwixt profitable and\nhonest things, so as to call some natural actions, that are not only\nprofitable but necessary, dishonest and foul.\n\nBut let us proceed in our examples of treachery two pretenders to the\nkingdom of Thrace--[Rhescuporis and Cotys. Tacitus, Annal., ii.  65]--\nwere fallen into dispute about their title; the emperor hindered them\nfrom proceeding to blows: but one of them, under colour of bringing\nthings to a friendly issue by an interview, having invited his competitor\nto an entertainment in his own house, imprisoned and killed him.  Justice\nrequired that the Romans should have satisfaction for this offence; but\nthere was a difficulty in obtaining it by ordinary ways; what, therefore,\nthey could not do legitimately, without war and without danger, they\nresolved to do by treachery; and what they could not honestly do, they\ndid profitably.  For which end, one Pomponius Flaccus was found to be a\nfit instrument.  This man, by dissembled words and assurances, having\ndrawn the other into his toils, instead of the honour and favour he had\npromised him, sent him bound hand and foot to Rome.  Here one traitor\nbetrayed another, contrary to common custom: for they are full of\nmistrust, and \u2018tis hard to overreach them in their own art: witness the\nsad experience we have lately had.--[Montaigne here probably refers to\nthe feigned reconciliation between Catherine de Medici and Henri, Duc de\nGuise, in 1588.]\n\nLet who will be Pomponius Flaccus, and there are enough who would: for my\npart, both my word and my faith are, like all the rest, parts of this\ncommon body: their best effect is the public service; this I take for\npresupposed.  But should one command me to take charge of the courts of\nlaw and lawsuits, I should make answer, that I understood it not; or the\nplace of a leader of pioneers, I would say, that I was called to a more\nhonourable employment; so likewise, he that would employ me to lie,\nbetray, and forswear myself, though not to assassinate or to poison, for\nsome notable service, I should say, \u201cIf I have robbed or stolen anything\nfrom any man, send me rather to the galleys.\u201d  For it is permissible in a\nman of honour to say, as the Lacedaemonians did,--[Plutarch, Difference\nbetween a Flatterer and a Friend, c. 21.]--having been defeated by\nAntipater, when just upon concluding an agreement: \u201cYou may impose as\nheavy and ruinous taxes upon us as you please, but to command us to do\nshameful and dishonest things, you will lose your time, for it is to no\npurpose.\u201d  Every one ought to make the same vow to himself that the kings\nof Egypt made their judges solemnly swear, that they would not do\nanything contrary to their consciences, though never so much commanded to\nit by themselves.  In such commissions there is evident mark of ignominy\nand condemnation; and he who gives it at the same time accuses you, and\ngives it, if you understand it right, for a burden and a punishment.\nAs much as the public affairs are bettered by your exploit, so much are\nyour own the worse, and the better you behave yourself in it, \u2018tis so\nmuch the worse for yourself; and it will be no new thing, nor,\nperadventure, without some colour of justice, if the same person ruin\nyou who set you on work.\n\nIf treachery can be in any case excusable, it must be only so when it is\npractised to chastise and betray treachery.  There are examples enough of\ntreacheries, not only rejected, but chastised and punished by those in\nfavour of whom they were undertaken.  Who is ignorant of Fabricius\nsentence against the physician of Pyrrhus?\n\nBut this we also find recorded, that some persons have commanded a thing,\nwho afterward have severely avenged the execution of it upon him they had\nemployed, rejecting the reputation of so unbridled an authority, and\ndisowning so abandoned and base a servitude and obedience.  Jaropelk,\nDuke of Russia, tampered with a gentleman of Hungary to betray Boleslaus,\nking of Poland, either by killing him, or by giving the Russians\nopportunity to do him some notable mischief.  This worthy went ably to\nwork: he was more assiduous than before in the service of that king, so\nthat he obtained the honour to be of his council, and one of the chiefest\nin his trust.  With these advantages, and taking an opportune occasion of\nhis master\u2019s absence, he betrayed Vislicza, a great and rich city, to the\nRussians, which was entirely sacked and burned, and not only all the\ninhabitants of both sexes, young and old, put to the sword, but moreover\na great number of neighbouring gentry, whom he had drawn thither to that\nend.  Jaropelk, his revenge being thus satisfied and his anger appeased,\nwhich was not, indeed, without pretence (for Boleslaus had highly\noffended him, and after the same manner), and sated with the fruit of\nthis treachery, coming to consider the fulness of it, with a sound\njudgment and clear from passion, looked upon what had been done with so\nmuch horror and remorse that he caused the eyes to be bored out and the\ntongue and shameful parts to be cut off of him who had performed it.\n\nAntigonus persuaded the Argyraspides to betray Eumenes, their general,\nhis adversary, into his hands; but after he had caused him, so delivered,\nto be slain, he would himself be the commissioner of the divine justice\nfor the punishment of so detestable a crime, and committed them into the\nhands of the governor of the province, with express command, by whatever\nmeans, to destroy and bring them all to an evil end, so that of that\ngreat number of men, not so much as one ever returned again into\nMacedonia: the better he had been served, the more wickedly he judged it\nto be, and meriting greater punishment.\n\nThe slave who betrayed the place where his master, P. Sulpicius, lay\nconcealed, was, according to the promise of Sylla\u2019s proscription,\nmanumitted for his pains; but according to the promise of the public\njustice, which was free from any such engagement, he was thrown headlong\nfrom the Tarpeian rock.\n\nOur King Clovis, instead of the arms of gold he had promised them, caused\nthree of Cararie\u2019s servants to be hanged after they had betrayed their\nmaster to him, though he had debauched them to it: he hanged them with\nthe purse of their reward about their necks; after having satisfied his\nsecond and special faith, he satisfied the general and first.\n\nMohammed II.  having resolved to rid himself of his brother, out of\njealousy of state, according to the practice of the Ottoman family, he\nemployed one of his officers in the execution, who, pouring a quantity of\nwater too fast into him, choked him.  This being done, to expiate the\nmurder, he delivered the murderer into the hands of the mother of him he\nhad so caused to be put to death, for they were only brothers by the\nfather\u2019s side; she, in his presence, ripped up the murderer\u2019s bosom, and\nwith her own hands rifled his breast for his heart, tore it out, and\nthrew it to the dogs.  And even to the worst people it is the sweetest\nthing imaginable, having once gained their end by a vicious action, to\nfoist, in all security, into it some show of virtue and justice, as by\nway of compensation and conscientious correction; to which may be added,\nthat they look upon the ministers of such horrid crimes as upon men who\nreproach them with them, and think by their deaths to erase the memory\nand testimony of such proceedings.\n\nOr if, perhaps, you are rewarded, not to frustrate the public necessity\nfor that extreme and desperate remedy, he who does it cannot for all\nthat, if he be not such himself, but look upon you as an accursed and\nexecrable fellow, and conclude you a greater traitor than he does,\nagainst whom you are so: for he tries the malignity of your disposition\nby your own hands, where he cannot possibly be deceived, you having no\nobject of preceding hatred to move you to such an act; but he employs you\nas they do condemned malefactors in executions of justice, an office as\nnecessary as dishonourable.  Besides the baseness of such commissions,\nthere is, moreover, a prostitution of conscience.  Seeing that the\ndaughter of Sejanus could not be put to death by the law of Rome, because\nshe was a virgin, she was, to make it lawful, first ravished by the\nhangman and then strangled: not only his hand but his soul is slave to\nthe public convenience.\n\nWhen Amurath I., more grievously to punish his subjects who had taken\npart in the parricide rebellion of his son, ordained that their nearest\nkindred should assist in the execution, I find it very handsome in some\nof them to have rather chosen to be unjustly thought guilty of the\nparricide of another than to serve justice by a parricide of their own.\nAnd where I have seen, at the taking of some little fort by assault in my\ntime, some rascals who, to save their own lives, would consent to hang\ntheir friends and companions, I have looked upon them to be of worse\ncondition than those who were hanged.  \u2018Tis said, that Witold, Prince of\nLithuania, introduced into the nation the practice that the criminal\ncondemned to death should with his own hand execute the sentence,\nthinking it strange that a third person, innocent of the fault, should be\nmade guilty of homicide.\n\nA prince, when by some urgent circumstance or some impetuous and\nunforeseen accident that very much concerns his state, compelled to\nforfeit his word and break his faith, or otherwise forced from his\nordinary duty, ought to attribute this necessity to a lash of the divine\nrod: vice it is not, for he has given up his own reason to a more\nuniversal and more powerful reason; but certainly \u2018tis a misfortune: so\nthat if any one should ask me what remedy?  \u201cNone,\u201d say I, \u201cif he were\nreally racked between these two extremes: \u2018sed videat, ne quoeratur\nlatebya perjurio\u2019, he must do it: but if he did it without regret, if it\ndid not weigh on him to do it, \u2018tis a sign his conscience is in a sorry\ncondition.\u201d  If there be a person to be found of so tender a conscience\nas to think no cure whatever worth so important a remedy, I shall like\nhim never the worse; he could not more excusably or more decently perish.\nWe cannot do all we would, so that we must often, as the last anchorage,\ncommit the protection of our vessels to the simple conduct of heaven.\nTo what more just necessity does he reserve himself?  What is less\npossible for him to do than what he cannot do but at the expense of his\nfaith and honour, things that, perhaps, ought to be dearer to him than\nhis own safety, or even the safety of his people.  Though he should, with\nfolded arms, only call God to his assistance, has he not reason to hope\nthat the divine goodness will not refuse the favour of an extraordinary\narm to just and pure hands?  These are dangerous examples, rare and\nsickly exceptions to our natural rules: we must yield to them, but with\ngreat moderation and circumspection: no private utility is of such\nimportance that we should upon that account strain our consciences to\nsuch a degree: the public may be, when very manifest and of very great\nconcern.\n\nTimoleon made a timely expiation for his strange exploit by the tears he\nshed, calling to mind that it was with a fraternal hand that he had slain\nthe tyrant; and it justly pricked his conscience that he had been\nnecessitated to purchase the public utility at so great a price as the\nviolation of his private morality.  Even the Senate itself, by his means\ndelivered from slavery, durst not positively determine of so high a fact,\nand divided into two so important and contrary aspects; but the\nSyracusans,  sending at the same time to the Corinthians to solicit their\nprotection, and to require of them a captain fit to re-establish their\ncity in its former dignity and to clear Sicily of several little tyrants\nby whom it was oppressed, they deputed Timoleon for that service, with\nthis cunning declaration; \u201cthat according as he should behave himself\nwell or ill in his employment, their sentence should incline either to\nfavour the deliverer of his country, or to disfavour the murderer of his\nbrother.\u201d  This fantastic conclusion carries along with it some excuse,\nby reason of the danger of the example, and the importance of so strange\nan action: and they did well to discharge their own judgment of it, and\nto refer it to others who were not so much concerned.  But Timoleon\u2019s\ncomportment in this expedition soon made his cause more clear, so\nworthily and virtuously he demeaned himself upon all occasions; and the\ngood fortune that accompanied him in the difficulties he had to overcome\nin this noble employment, seemed to be strewed in his way by the gods,\nfavourably conspiring for his justification.\n\nThe end of this matter is excusable, if any can be so; but the profit of\nthe augmentation of the public revenue, that served the Roman Senate for\na pretence to the foul conclusion I am going to relate, is not sufficient\nto warrant any such injustice.\n\nCertain cities had redeemed themselves and their liberty by money, by the\norder and consent of the Senate, out of the hands of L. Sylla: the\nbusiness coming again in question, the Senate condemned them to be\ntaxable as they were before, and that the money they had disbursed for\ntheir redemption should be lost to them.  Civil war often produces such\nvillainous examples; that we punish private men for confiding in us when\nwe were public ministers: and the self-same magistrate makes another man\npay the penalty of his change that has nothing to do with it; the\npedagogue whips his scholar for his docility; and the guide beats the\nblind man whom he leads by the hand; a horrid image of justice.\n\nThere are rules in philosophy that are both false and weak.  The example\nthat is proposed to us for preferring private utility before faith given,\nhas not weight enough by the circumstances they put to it; robbers have\nseized you, and after having made you swear to pay them a certain sum of\nmoney, dismiss you.  \u2018Tis not well done to say, that an honest man can be\nquit of his oath without payment, being out of their hands.  \u2018Tis no such\nthing: what fear has once made me willing to do, I am obliged to do it\nwhen I am no longer in fear; and though that fear only prevailed with my\ntongue without forcing my will, yet am I bound to keep my word.  For my\npart, when my tongue has sometimes inconsiderately said something that I\ndid not think, I have made a conscience of disowning it: otherwise, by\ndegrees, we shall abolish all the right another derives from our promises\nand oaths:\n\n               \u201cQuasi vero forti viro vis possit adhiberi.\u201d\n\n          [\u201cAs though a man of true courage could be compelled.\u201d\n           --Cicero, De Offic., iii. 30.]\n\nAnd \u2018tis only lawful, upon the account of private interest, to excuse\nbreach of promise, when we have promised something that is unlawful and\nwicked in itself; for the right of virtue ought to take place of the\nright of any obligation of ours.\n\nI have formerly placed Epaminondas in the first rank of excellent men,\nand do not repent it.  How high did he stretch the consideration of his\nown particular duty? he who never killed a man whom he had overcome; who,\nfor the inestimable benefit of restoring the liberty of his country, made\nconscience of killing a tyrant or his accomplices without due form of\njustice: and who concluded him to be a wicked man, how good a citizen\nsoever otherwise, who amongst his enemies in battle spared not his friend\nand his guest.  This was a soul of a rich composition: he married\ngoodness and humanity, nay, even the tenderest and most delicate in the\nwhole school of philosophy, to the roughest and most violent human\nactions.  Was it nature or art that had intenerated that great courage of\nhis, so full, so obstinate against pain and death and poverty, to such an\nextreme degree of sweetness and compassion?  Dreadful in arms and blood,\nhe overran and subdued a nation invincible by all others but by him\nalone; and yet in the heat of an encounter, could turn aside from his\nfriend and guest.  Certainly he was fit to command in war who could so\nrein himself with the curb of good nature, in the height and heat of his\nfury, a fury inflamed and foaming with blood and slaughter.  \u2018Tis a\nmiracle to be able to mix any image of justice with such violent actions:\nand it was only possible for such a steadfastness of mind as that of\nEpaminondas therein to mix sweetness and the facility of the gentlest\nmanners and purest innocence.  And whereas one told the Mamertini that\nstatutes were of no efficacy against armed men; and another told the\ntribune of the people that the time of justice and of war were distinct\nthings; and a third said that the noise of arms deafened the voice of\nlaws, this man was not precluded from listening to the laws of civility\nand pure courtesy.  Had he not borrowed from his enemies the custom of\nsacrificing to the Muses when he went to war, that they might by their\nsweetness and gaiety soften his martial and rigorous fury?  Let us not\nfear, by the example of so great a master, to believe that there is\nsomething unlawful, even against an enemy, and that the common concern\nought not to require all things of all men, against private interest:\n\n          \u201cManente memoria, etiam in dissidio publicorum\n          foederum, privati juris:\u201d\n\n          [\u201cThe memory of private right remaining even amid\n          public dissensions.\u201d--Livy, xxv. 18.]\n\n              \u201cEt nulla potentia vires\n               Praestandi, ne quid peccet amicus, habet;\u201d\n\n     [\u201cNo power on earth can sanction treachery against a friend.\u201d\n      --Ovid, De Ponto, i. 7, 37.]\n\nand that all things are not lawful to an honest man for the service of\nhis prince, the laws, or the general quarrel:\n\n          \u201cNon enim patria praestat omnibus officiis....\n          et ipsi conducit pios habere cives in parentes.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThe duty to one\u2019s country does not supersede all other duties.\n     The country itself requires that its citizens should act piously\n     toward their parents.\u201d--Cicero, De Offic., iii. 23.]\n\nTis an instruction proper for the time wherein we live: we need not\nharden our courage with these arms of steel; \u2018tis enough that our\nshoulders are inured to them: \u2018tis enough to dip our pens in ink without\ndipping them in blood.  If it be grandeur of courage, and the effect of a\nrare and singular virtue, to contemn friendship, private obligations, a\nman\u2019s word and relationship, for the common good and obedience to the\nmagistrate, \u2018tis certainly sufficient to excuse us, that \u2018tis a grandeur\nthat can have no place in the grandeur of Epaminondas\u2019 courage.\n\nI abominate those mad exhortations of this other discomposed soul,\n\n              \u201cDum tela micant, non vos pietatis imago\n               Ulla, nec adversa conspecti fronte parentes\n               Commoveant; vultus gladio turbate verendos.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cWhile swords glitter, let no idea of piety, nor the face even of a\n     father presented to you, move you: mutilate with your sword those\n     venerable features \u201c--Lucan, vii. 320.]\n\nLet us deprive wicked, bloody, and treacherous natures of such a pretence\nof reason: let us set aside this guilty and extravagant justice, and\nstick to more human imitations.  How great things can time and example\ndo!  In an encounter of the civil war against Cinna, one of Pompey\u2019s\nsoldiers having unawares killed his brother, who was of the contrary\nparty, he immediately for shame and sorrow killed himself: and some years\nafter, in another civil war of the same people, a soldier demanded a\nreward of his officer for having killed his brother.\n\nA man but ill proves the honour and beauty of an action by its utility:\nand very erroneously concludes that every one is obliged to it, and that\nit becomes every one to do it, if it be of utility:\n\n               \u201cOmnia non pariter rerum sunt omnibus apta.\u201d\n\n\n               [\u201cAll things are not equally fit for all men.\u201d\n                --Propertius, iii. 9, 7.]\n\nLet us take that which is most necessary and profitable for human\nsociety; it will be marriage; and yet the council of the saints find the\ncontrary much better, excluding from it the most venerable vocation of\nman: as we design those horses for stallions of which we have the least\nesteem.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nOF REPENTANCE\n\nOthers form man; I only report him: and represent a particular one, ill\nfashioned enough, and whom, if I had to model him anew, I should\ncertainly make something else than what he is but that\u2019s past recalling.\nNow, though the features of my picture alter and change, \u2018tis not,\nhowever, unlike: the world eternally turns round; all things therein are\nincessantly moving, the earth, the rocks of Caucasus, and the pyramids of\nEgypt, both by the public motion and their own.  Even constancy itself is\nno other but a slower and more languishing motion.  I cannot fix my\nobject; \u2018tis always tottering and reeling by a natural giddiness; I take\nit as it is at the instant I consider it; I do not paint its being, I\npaint its passage; not a passing from one age to another, or, as the\npeople say, from seven to seven years, but from day to day, from minute\nto minute, I must accommodate my history to the hour: I may presently\nchange, not only by fortune, but also by intention.  \u2018Tis a counterpart\nof various and changeable accidents, and of irresolute imaginations, and,\nas it falls out, sometimes contrary: whether it be that I am then another\nself, or that I take subjects by other circumstances and considerations:\nso it is that I may peradventure contradict myself, but, as Demades said,\nI never contradict the truth.  Could my soul once take footing, I would\nnot essay but resolve: but it is always learning and making trial.\n\nI propose a life ordinary and without lustre: \u2018tis all one; all moral\nphilosophy may as well be applied to a common and private life, as to one\nof richer composition: every man carries the entire form of human\ncondition.  Authors communicate themselves to the people by some especial\nand extrinsic mark; I, the first of any, by my universal being; as Michel\nde Montaigne, not as a grammarian, a poet, or a lawyer.  If the world\nfind fault that I speak too much of myself, I find fault that they do not\nso much as think of themselves.  But is it reason that, being so\nparticular in my way of living, I should pretend to recommend myself to\nthe public knowledge?  And is it also reason that I should produce to the\nworld, where art and handling have so much credit and authority, crude\nand simple effects of nature, and of a weak nature to boot?  Is it not to\nbuild a wall without stone or brick, or some such thing, to write books\nwithout learning and without art?  The fancies of music are carried on by\nart; mine by chance.  I have this, at least, according to discipline,\nthat never any man treated of a subject he better understood and knew\nthan I what I have undertaken, and that in this I am the most\nunderstanding man alive: secondly, that never any man penetrated farther\ninto his matter, nor better and more distinctly sifted the parts and\nsequences of it, nor ever more exactly and fully arrived at the end he\nproposed to himself.  To perfect it, I need bring nothing but fidelity to\nthe work; and that is there, and the most pure and sincere that is\nanywhere to be found.  I speak truth, not so much as I would, but as much\nas I dare; and I dare a little the more, as I grow older; for, methinks,\ncustom allows to age more liberty of prating, and more indiscretion of\ntalking of a man\u2019s self.  That cannot fall out here, which I often see\nelsewhere, that the work and the artificer contradict one another:\n\u201cCan a man of such sober conversation have written so foolish a book?\u201d\n Or \u201cDo so learned writings proceed from a man of so weak conversation?\u201d\n He who talks at a very ordinary rate, and writes rare matter, \u2018tis to say\nthat his capacity is borrowed and not his own.  A learned man is not\nlearned in all things: but a sufficient man is sufficient throughout,\neven to ignorance itself; here my book and I go hand in hand together.\nElsewhere men may commend or censure the work, without reference to the\nworkman; here they cannot: who touches the one, touches the other.  He\nwho shall judge of it without knowing him, will more wrong himself than\nme; he who does know him, gives me all the satisfaction I desire.  I\nshall be happy beyond my desert, if I can obtain only thus much from the\npublic approbation, as to make men of understanding perceive that I was\ncapable of profiting by knowledge, had I had it; and that I deserved to\nhave been assisted by a better memory.\n\nBe pleased here to excuse what I often repeat, that I very rarely repent,\nand that my conscience is satisfied with itself, not as the conscience of\nan angel, or that of a horse, but as the conscience of a man; always\nadding this clause, not one of ceremony, but a true and real submission,\nthat I speak inquiring and doubting, purely and simply referring myself\nto the common and accepted beliefs for the resolution.  I do not teach; I\nonly relate.\n\nThere is no vice that is absolutely a vice which does not offend, and\nthat a sound judgment does not accuse; for there is in it so manifest a\ndeformity and inconvenience, that peradventure they are in the right who\nsay that it is chiefly begotten by stupidity and ignorance: so hard is it\nto imagine that a man can know without abhorring it.  Malice sucks up the\ngreatest part of its own venom, and poisons itself.  Vice leaves\nrepentance in the soul, like an ulcer in the flesh, which is always\nscratching and lacerating itself: for reason effaces all other grief and\nsorrows, but it begets that of repentance, which is so much the more\ngrievous, by reason it springs within, as the cold and heat of fevers are\nmore sharp than those that only strike upon the outward skin.  I hold for\nvices (but every one according to its proportion), not only those which\nreason and nature condemn, but those also which the opinion of men,\nthough false and erroneous, have made such, if authorised by law and\ncustom.\n\nThere is likewise no virtue which does not rejoice a well-descended\nnature: there is a kind of, I know not what, congratulation in well-doing\nthat gives us an inward satisfaction, and a generous boldness that\naccompanies a good conscience: a soul daringly vicious may, peradventure,\narm itself with security, but it cannot supply itself with this\ncomplacency and satisfaction.  \u2018Tis no little satisfaction to feel a\nman\u2019s self preserved from the contagion of so depraved an age, and to say\nto himself: \u201cWhoever could penetrate into my soul would not there find me\nguilty either of the affliction or ruin of any one, or of revenge or\nenvy, or any offence against the public laws, or of innovation or\ndisturbance, or failure of my word; and though the licence of the time\npermits and teaches every one so to do, yet have I not plundered any\nFrenchman\u2019s goods, or taken his money, and have lived upon what is my\nown, in war as well as in peace; neither have I set any man to work\nwithout paying him his hire.\u201d  These testimonies of a good conscience\nplease, and this natural rejoicing is very beneficial to us, and the only\nreward that we can never fail of.\n\nTo ground the recompense of virtuous actions upon the approbation of\nothers is too uncertain and unsafe a foundation, especially in so corrupt\nand ignorant an age as this, wherein the good opinion of the vulgar is\ninjurious: upon whom do you rely to show you what is recommendable?  God\ndefend me from being an honest man, according to the descriptions of\nhonour I daily see every one make of himself:\n\n               \u201cQuae fuerant vitia, mores sunt.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cWhat before had been vices are now manners.\u201d--Seneca, Ep., 39.]\n\nSome of my friends have at times schooled and scolded me with great\nsincerity and plainness, either of their own voluntary motion, or by me\nentreated to it as to an office, which to a well-composed soul surpasses\nnot only in utility, but in kindness, all other offices of friendship: I\nhave always received them with the most open arms, both of courtesy and\nacknowledgment; but to say the truth, I have often found so much false\nmeasure, both in their reproaches and praises, that I had not done much\namiss, rather to have done ill, than to have done well according to their\nnotions.  We, who live private lives, not exposed to any other view than\nour own, ought chiefly to have settled a pattern within ourselves by\nwhich to try our actions: and according to that, sometimes to encourage\nand sometimes to correct ourselves.  I have my laws and my judicature to\njudge of myself, and apply myself more to these than to any other rules:\nI do, indeed, restrain my actions according to others; but extend them\nnot by any other rule than my own.  You yourself only know if you are\ncowardly and cruel, loyal and devout: others see you not, and only guess\nat you by uncertain conjectures, and do not so much see your nature as\nyour art; rely not therefore upon their opinions, but stick to your own:\n\n     \u201cTuo tibi judicio est utendum.... Virtutis et vitiorum grave ipsius\n     conscientiae pondus est: qua sublata, jacent omnia.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThou must employ thy own judgment upon thyself; great is the\n     weight of thy own conscience in the discovery of virtues and vices:\n     which taken away, all things are lost.\u201d\n      --Cicero, De Nat. Dei, iii.  35; Tusc. Quaes., i. 25.]\n\nBut the saying that repentance immediately follows the sin seems not to\nhave respect to sin in its high estate, which is lodged in us as in its\nown proper habitation.  One may disown and retract the vices that\nsurprise us, and to which we are hurried by passions; but those which by\na long habit are rooted in a strong and vigorous will are not subject to\ncontradiction.  Repentance is no other but a recanting of the will and an\nopposition to our fancies, which lead us which way they please.  It makes\nthis person disown his former virtue and continency:\n\n         \u201cQuae mens est hodie, cur eadem non puero fait?\n          Vel cur his animis incolumes non redeunt genae?\u201d\n\n     [\u201cWhat my mind is, why was it not the same, when I was a boy?  or\n     why do not the cheeks return to these feelings?\u201d\n      --Horace, Od., v. 10, 7.]\n\n\u2018Tis an exact life that maintains itself in due order in private.  Every\none may juggle his part, and represent an honest man upon the stage: but\nwithin, and in his own bosom, where all may do as they list, where all is\nconcealed, to be regular, there\u2019s the point.  The next degree is to be so\nin his house, and in his ordinary actions, for which we are accountable\nto none, and where there is no study nor artifice.  And therefore Bias,\nsetting forth the excellent state of a private family, says: \u201cof which a\nthe master is the same within, by his own virtue and temper, that he is\nabroad, for fear of the laws and report of men.\u201d  And it was a worthy\nsaying of Julius Drusus, to the masons who offered him, for three\nthousand crowns, to put his house in such a posture that his neighbours\nshould no longer have the same inspection into it as before; \u201cI will give\nyou,\u201d said he, \u201csix thousand to make it so that everybody may see into\nevery room.\u201d  \u2018Tis honourably recorded of Agesilaus, that he used in his\njourneys always to take up his lodgings in temples, to the end that the\npeople and the gods themselves might pry into his most private actions.\nSuch a one has been a miracle to the world, in whom neither his wife nor\nservant has ever seen anything so much as remarkable; few men have been\nadmired by their own domestics; no one was ever a prophet, not merely in\nhis own house, but in his own country, says the experience of histories:\n--[No man is a hero to his valet-de-chambre, said Marshal Catinat]--\u2018tis\nthe same in things of nought, and in this low example the image of a\ngreater is to be seen.  In my country of Gascony, they look upon it as a\ndrollery to see me in print; the further off I am read from my own home,\nthe better I am esteemed.  I purchase printers in Guienne; elsewhere they\npurchase me.  Upon this it is that they lay their foundation who conceal\nthemselves present and living, to obtain a name when they are dead and\nabsent.  I had rather have a great deal less in hand, and do not expose\nmyself to the world upon any other account than my present share; when I\nleave it I quit the rest.  See this functionary whom the people escort in\nstate, with wonder and applause, to his very door; he puts off the\npageant with his robe, and falls so much the lower by how much he was\nhigher exalted: in himself within, all is tumult and degraded.  And\nthough all should be regular there, it will require a vivid and\nwell-chosen judgment to perceive it in these low and private actions; to\nwhich may be added, that order is a dull, sombre virtue.  To enter a\nbreach, conduct an embassy, govern a people, are actions of renown; to\nreprehend, laugh, sell, pay, love, hate, and gently and justly converse\nwith a man\u2019s own family and with himself; not to relax, not to give a\nman\u2019s self the lie, is more rare and hard, and less remarkable.  By which\nmeans, retired lives, whatever is said to the contrary, undergo duties of\nas great or greater difficulty than the others do; and private men, says\nAristotle,\u2019 serve virtue more painfully and highly than those in\nauthority do: we prepare ourselves for eminent occasions, more out of\nglory than conscience.  The shortest way to arrive at glory, would be to\ndo that for conscience which we do for glory: and the virtue of Alexander\nappears to me of much less vigour in his great theatre, than that of\nSocrates in his mean and obscure employment.  I can easily conceive\nSocrates in the place of Alexander, but Alexander in that of Socrates, I\ncannot.  Who shall ask the one what he can do, he will answer, \u201cSubdue\nthe world\u201d: and who shall put the same question to the other, he will\nsay, \u201cCarry on human life conformably with its natural condition\u201d; a much\nmore general, weighty, and legitimate science than the other.--[Montaigne\nadded here, \u201cTo do for the world that for which he came into the world,\u201d\n but he afterwards erased these words from the manuscript.--Naigeon.]\n\nThe virtue of the soul does not consist in flying high, but in walking\norderly; its grandeur does not exercise itself in grandeur, but in\nmediocrity.  As they who judge and try us within, make no great account\nof the lustre of our public actions, and see they are only streaks and\nrays of clear water springing from a slimy and muddy bottom so, likewise,\nthey who judge of us by this gallant outward appearance, in like manner\nconclude of our internal constitution; and cannot couple common\nfaculties, and like their own, with the other faculties that astonish\nthem, and are so far out of their sight.  Therefore it is that we give\nsuch savage forms to demons: and who does not give Tamerlane great\neyebrows, wide nostrils, a dreadful visage, and a prodigious stature,\naccording to the imagination he has conceived by the report of his name?\nHad any one formerly brought me to Erasmus, I should hardly have believed\nbut that all was adage and apothegm he spoke to his man or his hostess.\nWe much more aptly imagine an artisan upon his close-stool, or upon his\nwife, than a great president venerable by his port and sufficiency: we\nfancy that they, from their high tribunals, will not abase themselves so\nmuch as to live.  As vicious souls are often incited by some foreign\nimpulse to do well, so are virtuous souls to do ill; they are therefore\nto be judged by their settled state, when they are at home, whenever that\nmay be; and, at all events, when they are nearer repose, and in their\nnative station.\n\nNatural inclinations are much assisted and fortified by education; but\nthey seldom alter and overcome their institution: a thousand natures of\nmy time have escaped towards virtue or vice, through a quite contrary\ndiscipline:\n\n              \u201cSic ubi, desuetae silvis, in carcere clausae\n               Mansuevere ferx, et vultus posuere minaces,\n               Atque hominem didicere pati, si torrida parvus\n               Venit in ora cruor, redeunt rabiesque fororque,\n               Admonitaeque tument gustato sanguine fauces\n               Fervet, et a trepido vix abstinet ira magistro;\u201d\n\n     [\u201cSo savage beasts, when shut up in cages and grown unaccustomed to\n     the woods, have become tame, and have laid aside their fierce looks,\n     and submit to the rule of man; if again a slight taste of blood\n     comes into their mouths, their rage and fury return, their jaws are\n     erected by thirst of blood, and their anger scarcely abstains from\n     their trembling masters.\u201d--Lucan, iv. 237.]\n\nthese original qualities are not to be rooted out; they may be covered\nand concealed.  The Latin tongue is as it were natural to me; I\nunderstand it better than French; but I have not been used to speak it,\nnor hardly to write it, these forty years.  Unless upon extreme and\nsudden emotions which I have fallen into twice or thrice in my life, and\nonce seeing my father in perfect health fall upon me in a swoon, I have\nalways uttered from the bottom of my heart my first words in Latin;\nnature deafened, and forcibly expressing itself, in spite of so long a\ndiscontinuation; and this example is said of many others.\n\nThey who in my time have attempted to correct the manners of the world by\nnew opinions, reform seeming vices; but the essential vices they leave as\nthey were, if indeed they do not augment them, and augmentation is\ntherein to be feared; we defer all other well doing upon the account of\nthese external reformations, of less cost and greater show, and thereby\nexpiate good cheap, for the other natural, consubstantial, and intestine\nvices.  Look a little into our experience: there is no man, if he listen\nto himself, who does not in himself discover a particular and governing\nform of his own, that jostles his education, and wrestles with the\ntempest of passions that are contrary to it.  For my part, I seldom find\nmyself agitated with surprises; I always find myself in my place, as\nheavy and unwieldy bodies do; if I am not at home, I am always near at\nhand; my dissipations do not transport me very far; there is nothing\nstrange or extreme in the case; and yet I have sound and vigorous turns.\n\nThe true condemnation, and which touches the common practice of men, is\nthat their very retirement itself is full of filth and corruption; the\nidea of their reformation composed, their repentance sick and faulty,\nvery nearly as much as their sin.  Some, either from having been linked\nto vice by a natural propension or long practice, cannot see its\ndeformity.  Others (of which constitution I am) do indeed feel the weight\nof vice, but they counterbalance it with pleasure, or some other\noccasion; and suffer and lend themselves to it for a certain price, but\nviciously and basely.  Yet there might, haply, be imagined so vast a\ndisproportion of measure, where with justice the pleasure might excuse\nthe sin, as we say of utility; not only if accidental and out of sin, as\nin thefts, but in the very exercise of sin, or in the enjoyment of women,\nwhere the temptation is violent, and, \u2018tis said, sometimes not to be\novercome.\n\nBeing the other day at Armaignac, on the estate of a kinsman of mine, I\nthere saw a peasant who was by every one nicknamed the thief.  He thus\nrelated the story of his life: that, being born a beggar, and finding\nthat he should not be able, so as to be clear of indigence, to get his\nliving by the sweat of his brow, he resolved to turn thief, and by means\nof his strength of body had exercised this trade all the time of his\nyouth in great security; for he ever made his harvest and vintage in\nother men\u2019s grounds, but a great way off, and in so great quantities,\nthat it was not to be imagined one man could have carried away so much in\none night upon his shoulders; and, moreover, he was careful equally to\ndivide and distribute the mischief he did, that the loss was of less\nimportance to every particular man.  He is now grown old, and rich for a\nman of his condition, thanks to his trade, which he openly confesses to\nevery one.  And to make his peace with God, he says, that he is daily\nready by good offices to make satisfaction to the successors of those he\nhas robbed, and if he do not finish (for to do it all at once he is not\nable), he will then leave it in charge to his heirs to perform the rest,\nproportionably to the wrong he himself only knows he has done to each.\nBy this description, true or false, this man looks upon theft as a\ndishonest action, and hates it, but less than poverty, and simply\nrepents; but to the extent he has thus recompensed he repents not.  This\nis not that habit which incorporates us into vice, and conforms even our\nunderstanding itself to it; nor is it that impetuous whirlwind that by\ngusts troubles and blinds our souls, and for the time precipitates us,\njudgment and all, into the power of vice.\n\nI customarily do what I do thoroughly and make but one step on\u2019t; I have\nrarely any movement that hides itself and steals away from my reason, and\nthat does not proceed in the matter by the consent of all my faculties,\nwithout division or intestine sedition; my judgment is to have all the\nblame or all the praise; and the blame it once has, it has always; for\nalmost from my infancy it has ever been one: the same inclination, the\nsame turn, the same force; and as to universal opinions, I fixed myself\nfrom my childhood in the place where I resolved to stick.  There are some\nsins that are impetuous, prompt, and sudden; let us set them aside: but\nin these other sins so often repeated, deliberated, and contrived,\nwhether sins of complexion or sins of profession and vocation, I cannot\nconceive that they should have so long been settled in the same\nresolution, unless the reason and conscience of him who has them, be\nconstant to have them; and the repentance he boasts to be inspired with\non a sudden, is very hard for me to imagine or form.  I follow not the\nopinion of the Pythagorean sect, \u201cthat men take up a new soul when they\nrepair to the images of the gods to receive their oracles,\u201d unless he\nmean that it must needs be extrinsic, new, and lent for the time; our own\nshowing so little sign of purification and cleanness, fit for such an\noffice.\n\nThey act quite contrary to the stoical precepts, who do indeed command us\nto correct the imperfections and vices we know ourselves guilty of, but\nforbid us therefore to disturb the repose of our souls: these make us\nbelieve that they have great grief and remorse within: but of amendment,\ncorrection, or interruption, they make nothing appear.  It cannot be a\ncure if the malady be not wholly discharged; if repentance were laid upon\nthe scale of the balance, it would weigh down sin.  I find no quality so\neasy to counterfeit as devotion, if men do not conform their manners and\nlife to the profession; its essence is abstruse and occult; the\nappearance easy and ostentatious.\n\nFor my own part, I may desire in general to be other than I am; I may\ncondemn and dislike my whole form, and beg of Almighty God for an entire\nreformation, and that He will please to pardon my natural infirmity: but\nI ought not to call this repentance, methinks, no more than the being\ndissatisfied that I am not an angel or Cato.  My actions are regular,\nand conformable to what I am and to my condition; I can do no better;\nand repentance does not properly touch things that are not in our power;\nsorrow does..  I imagine an infinite number of natures more elevated and\nregular than mine; and yet I do not for all that improve my faculties, no\nmore than my arm or will grow more strong and vigorous for conceiving\nthose of another to be so.  If to conceive and wish a nobler way of\nacting than that we have should produce a repentance of our own, we must\nthen repent us of our most innocent actions, forasmuch as we may well\nsuppose that in a more excellent nature they would have been carried on\nwith greater dignity and perfection; and we would that ours were so.\nWhen I reflect upon the deportment of my youth, with that of my old age,\nI find that I have commonly behaved myself with equal order in both\naccording to what I understand: this is all that my resistance can do.\nI do not flatter myself; in the same circumstances I should do the same\nthings.  It is not a patch, but rather an universal tincture, with which\nI am stained.  I know no repentance, superficial, half-way, and\nceremonious; it must sting me all over before I can call it so, and must\nprick my bowels as deeply and universally as God sees into me.\n\nAs to business, many excellent opportunities have escaped me for want of\ngood management; and yet my deliberations were sound enough, according to\nthe occurrences presented to me: \u2018tis their way to choose always the\neasiest and safest course.  I find that, in my former resolves, I have\nproceeded with discretion, according to my own rule, and according to the\nstate of the subject proposed, and should do the same a thousand years\nhence in like occasions; I do not consider what it is now, but what it\nwas then, when I deliberated on it: the force of all counsel consists in\nthe time; occasions and things eternally shift and change.  I have in my\nlife committed some important errors, not for want of good understanding,\nbut for want of good luck.  There are secret, and not to be foreseen,\nparts in matters we have in hand, especially in the nature of men; mute\nconditions, that make no show, unknown sometimes even to the possessors\nthemselves, that spring and start up by incidental occasions; if my\nprudence could not penetrate into nor foresee them, I blame it not: \u2018tis\ncommissioned no further than its own limits; if the event be too hard for\nme, and take the side I have refused, there is no remedy; I do not blame\nmyself, I accuse my fortune, and not my work; this cannot be called\nrepentance.\n\nPhocion, having given the Athenians an advice that was not followed, and\nthe affair nevertheless succeeding contrary to his opinion, some one said\nto him, \u201cWell, Phocion, art thou content that matters go so well?\u201d--\u201cI am\nvery well content,\u201d replied he, \u201cthat this has happened so well, but I do\nnot repent that I counselled the other.\u201d  When any of my friends address\nthemselves to me for advice, I give it candidly and clearly, without\nsticking, as almost all other men do, at the hazard of the thing\u2019s\nfalling out contrary to my opinion, and that I may be reproached for my\ncounsel; I am very indifferent as to that, for the fault will be theirs\nfor having consulted me, and I could not refuse them that office.\n--[We may give advice to others, says Rochefoucauld, but we cannot\nsupply them with the wit to profit by it.]\n\nI, for my own part, can rarely blame any one but myself for my oversights\nand misfortunes, for indeed I seldom solicit the advice of another,\nif not by honour of ceremony, or excepting where I stand in need of\ninformation, special science, or as to matter of fact.  But in things\nwherein I stand in need of nothing but judgment, other men\u2019s reasons may\nserve to fortify my own, but have little power to dissuade me; I hear\nthem all with civility and patience; but, to my recollection, I never\nmade use of any but my own.  With me, they are but flies and atoms, that\nconfound and distract my will; I lay no great stress upon my opinions;\nbut I lay as little upon those of others, and fortune rewards me\naccordingly: if I receive but little advice, I also give but little.  I\nam seldom consulted, and still more seldom believed, and know no concern,\neither public or private, that has been mended or bettered by my advice.\nEven they whom fortune had in some sort tied to my direction, have more\nwillingly suffered themselves to be governed by any other counsels than\nmine.  And as a man who am as jealous of my repose as of my authority,\nI am better pleased that it should be so; in leaving me there, they\nhumour what I profess, which is to settle and wholly contain myself\nwithin myself.  I take a pleasure in being uninterested in other men\u2019s\naffairs, and disengaged from being their warranty, and responsible for\nwhat they do.\n\nIn all affairs that are past, be it how it will, I have very little\nregret; for this imagination puts me out of my pain, that they were so to\nfall out they are in the great revolution of the world, and in the chain\nof stoical \u2018causes: your fancy cannot, by wish and imagination, move one\ntittle, but that the great current of things will not reverse both the\npast and the future.\n\nAs to the rest, I abominate that incidental repentance which old age\nbrings along with it.  He, who said of old, that he was obliged to his\nage for having weaned him from pleasure, was of another opinion than I\nam; I can never think myself beholden to impotency for any good it can do\nto me:\n\n     \u201cNec tam aversa unquam videbitur ab opere suo providentia,\n     ut debilitas inter optima inventa sit.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cNor can Providence ever seem so averse to her own work, that\n     debility should be found to be amongst the best things.\u201d\n      --Quintilian, Instit.  Orat., v. 12.]\n\nOur appetites are rare in old age; a profound satiety seizes us after the\nact; in this I see nothing of conscience; chagrin and weakness imprint in\nus a drowsy and rheumatic virtue.  We must not suffer ourselves to be so\nwholly carried away by natural alterations as to suffer our judgments to\nbe imposed upon by them.  Youth and pleasure have not formerly so far\nprevailed with me, that I did not well enough discern the face of vice in\npleasure; neither does the distaste that years have brought me, so far\nprevail with me now, that I cannot discern pleasure in vice.  Now that I\nam no more in my flourishing age, I judge as well of these things as if I\nwere.\n\n          [\u201cOld though I am, for ladies\u2019 love unfit,\n          The power of beauty I remember yet.\u201d--Chaucer.]\n\nI, who narrowly and strictly examine it, find my reason the very same it\nwas in my most licentious age, except, perhaps, that \u2018tis weaker and more\ndecayed by being grown older; and I find that the pleasure it refuses me\nupon the account of my bodily health, it would no more refuse now, in\nconsideration of the health of my soul, than at any time heretofore.\nI do not repute it the more valiant for not being able to combat; my\ntemptations are so broken and mortified, that they are not worth its\nopposition; holding but out my hands, I repel them.  Should one present\nthe old concupiscence before it, I fear it would have less power to\nresist it than heretofore; I do not discern that in itself it judges\nanything otherwise now than it formerly did, nor that it has acquired any\nnew light: wherefore, if there be convalescence, \u2018tis an enchanted one.\nMiserable kind of remedy, to owe one\u2019s health to one\u2019s disease!  Tis not\nthat our misfortune should perform this office, but the good fortune of\nour judgment.  I am not to be made to do anything by persecutions and\nafflictions, but to curse them: that is, for people who cannot be roused\nbut by a whip.  My reason is much more free in prosperity, and much more\ndistracted, and put to\u2019t to digest pains than pleasures: I see best in a\nclear sky; health admonishes me more cheerfully, and to better purpose,\nthan sickness.  I did all that in me lay to reform and regulate myself\nfrom pleasures, at a time when I had health and vigour to enjoy them;\nI should be ashamed and envious that the misery and misfortune of my old\nage should have credit over my good healthful, sprightly, and vigorous\nyears, and that men should estimate me, not by what I have been, but by\nwhat I have ceased to be.\n\nIn my opinion, \u2018tis the happy living, and not (as Antisthenes\u2019 said) the\nhappy dying, in which human felicity consists.  I have not made it my\nbusiness to make a monstrous addition of a philosopher\u2019s tail to the head\nand body of a libertine; nor would I have this wretched remainder give\nthe lie to the pleasant, sound, and long part of my life: I would present\nmyself uniformly throughout.  Were I to live my life over again, I should\nlive it just as I have lived it; I neither complain of the past, nor do I\nfear the future; and if I am not much deceived, I am the same within that\nI am without.  \u2018Tis one main obligation I have to my fortune, that the\nsuccession of my bodily estate has been carried on according to the\nnatural seasons; I have seen the grass, the blossom, and the fruit, and\nnow see the withering; happily, however, because naturally.  I bear the\ninfirmities I have the better, because they came not till I had reason to\nexpect them, and because also they make me with greater pleasure remember\nthat long felicity of my past life.  My wisdom may have been just the\nsame in both ages, but it was more active, and of better grace whilst\nyoung and sprightly, than now it is when broken, peevish, and uneasy.\nI repudiate, then, these casual and painful reformations.  God must touch\nour hearts; our consciences must amend of themselves, by the aid of our\nreason, and not by the decay of our appetites; pleasure is, in itself,\nneither pale nor discoloured, to be discerned by dim and decayed eyes.\n\nWe ought to love temperance for itself, and because God has commanded\nthat and chastity; but that which we are reduced to by catarrhs, and for\nwhich I am indebted to the stone, is neither chastity nor temperance; a\nman cannot boast that he despises and resists pleasure if he cannot see\nit, if he knows not what it is, and cannot discern its graces, its force,\nand most alluring beauties; I know both the one and the other, and may\ntherefore the better say it.  But; methinks, our souls in old age are\nsubject to more troublesome maladies and imperfections than in youth;\nI said the same when young and when I was reproached with the want of a\nbeard; and I say so now that my grey hairs give me some authority.  We\ncall the difficulty of our humours and the disrelish of present things\nwisdom; but, in truth, we do not so much forsake vices as we change them,\nand in my opinion, for worse.  Besides a foolish and feeble pride, an\nimpertinent prating, froward and insociable humours, superstition, and a\nridiculous desire of riches when we have lost the use of them, I find\nthere more envy, injustice, and malice.  Age imprints more wrinkles in\nthe mind than it does on the face; and souls are never, or very rarely\nseen, that, in growing old, do not smell sour and musty.  Man moves all\ntogether, both towards his perfection and decay.  In observing the wisdom\nof Socrates, and many circumstances of his condemnation, I should dare to\nbelieve that he in some sort himself purposely, by collusion, contributed\nto it, seeing that, at the age of seventy years, he might fear to suffer\nthe lofty motions of his mind to be cramped and his wonted lustre\nobscured.  What strange metamorphoses do I see age every day make in many\nof my acquaintance!  \u2018Tis a potent malady, and that naturally and\nimperceptibly steals into us; a vast provision of study and great\nprecaution are required to evade the imperfections it loads us with, or\nat least to weaken their progress.  I find that, notwithstanding all my\nentrenchments, it gets foot by foot upon me: I make the best resistance I\ncan, but I do not know to what at last it will reduce me.  But fall out\nwhat will, I am content the world may know, when I am fallen, from what I\nfell.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nOF THREE COMMERCES\n\nWe must not rivet ourselves so fast to our humours and complexions: our\nchiefest sufficiency is to know how to apply ourselves to divers\nemployments.  \u2018Tis to be, but not to live, to keep a man\u2019s self tied and\nbound by necessity to one only course; those are the bravest souls that\nhave in them the most variety and pliancy.  Of this here is an honourable\ntestimony of the elder Cato:\n\n          \u201cHuic versatile ingenium sic pariter ad omnia fuit,\n          ut natum ad id unum diceres, quodcumque ageret.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cHis parts were so pliable to all uses, that one would say he had\n     been born only to that which he was doing.\u201d--Livy, xxxix. 49.]\n\nHad I liberty to set myself forth after my own mode, there is no so\ngraceful fashion to which I would be so fixed as not to be able to\ndisengage myself from it; life is an unequal, irregular and multiform\nmotion.  \u2018Tis not to be a friend to one\u2019s self, much less a master \u2018tis\nto be a slave, incessantly to be led by the nose by one\u2019s self, and to be\nso fixed in one\u2019s previous inclinations, that one cannot turn aside nor\nwrithe one\u2019s neck out of the collar.  I say this now in this part of my\nlife, wherein I find I cannot easily disengage myself from the\nimportunity of my soul, which cannot ordinarily amuse itself but in\nthings of limited range, nor employ itself otherwise than entirely and\nwith all its force; upon the lightest subject offered it expands and\nstretches it to that degree as therein to employ its utmost power;\nwherefore it is that idleness is to me a very painful labour, and very\nprejudicial to my health.  Most men\u2019s minds require foreign matter to\nexercise and enliven them; mine has rather need of it to sit still and\nrepose itself,\n\n               \u201cVitia otii negotio discutienda sunt,\u201d\n\n          [\u201cThe vices of sloth are to be shaken off by business.\u201d\n           --Seneca, Ep. 56.]\n\nfor its chiefest and hardest study is to study itself.  Books are to it\na sort of employment that debauch it from its study.  Upon the first\nthoughts that possess it, it begins to bustle and make trial of its\nvigour in all directions, exercises its power of handling, now making\ntrial of force, now fortifying, moderating, and ranging itself by the way\nof grace and order.  It has of its own wherewith to rouse its faculties:\nnature has given to it, as to all others, matter enough of its own to\nmake advantage of, and subjects proper enough where it may either invent\nor judge.\n\nMeditation is a powerful and full study to such as can effectually taste\nand employ themselves; I had rather fashion my soul than furnish it.\nThere is no employment, either more weak or more strong, than that of\nentertaining a man\u2019s own thoughts, according as the soul is; the greatest\nmen make it their whole business,\n\n                    \u201cQuibus vivere est cogitare;\u201d\n\n     [\u201cTo whom to live is to think.\u201d--Cicero, Tusc. Quaes., v. 28.]\n\nnature has therefore favoured it with this privilege, that there is\nnothing we can do so long, nor any action to which we more frequently and\nwith greater facility addict ourselves.  \u2018Tis the business of the gods,\nsays Aristotle,\u2019 and from which both their beatitude and ours proceed.\n\nThe principal use of reading to me is, that by various objects it rouses\nmy reason, and employs my judgment, not my memory.  Few conversations\ndetain me without force and effort; it is true that beauty and elegance\nof speech take as much or more with me than the weight and depth of the\nsubject; and forasmuch as I am apt to be sleepy in all other\ncommunication, and give but the rind of my attention, it often falls out\nthat in such poor and pitiful discourses, mere chatter, I either make\ndrowsy, unmeaning answers, unbecoming a child, and ridiculous, or more\nfoolishly and rudely still, maintain an obstinate silence.  I have a\npensive way that withdraws me into myself, and, with that, a heavy and\nchildish ignorance of many very ordinary things, by which two qualities I\nhave earned this, that men may truly relate five or six as ridiculous\ntales of me as of any other man whatever.\n\nBut, to proceed in my subject, this difficult complexion of mine renders\nme very nice in my conversation with men, whom I must cull and pick out\nfor my purpose; and unfits me for common society.  We live and negotiate\nwith the people; if their conversation be troublesome to us, if we\ndisdain to apply ourselves to mean and vulgar souls (and the mean and\nvulgar are often as regular as those of the finest thread, and all wisdom\nis folly that does not accommodate itself to the common ignorance),\nwe must no more intermeddle either with other men\u2019s affairs or our own;\nfor business, both public and private, has to do with these people.  The\nleast forced and most natural motions of the soul are the most beautiful;\nthe best employments, those that are least strained.  My God!  how good\nan office does wisdom to those whose desires it limits to their power!\nthat is the most useful knowledge: \u201caccording to what a man can,\u201d was the\nfavourite sentence and motto of Socrates.  A motto of great solidity.\n\nWe must moderate and adapt our desires to the nearest and easiest to be\nacquired things.  Is it not a foolish humour of mine to separate myself\nfrom a thousand to whom my fortune has conjoined me, and without whom I\ncannot live, and cleave to one or two who are out of my intercourse; or\nrather a fantastic desire of a thing I cannot obtain?  My gentle and easy\nmanners, enemies of all sourness and harshness, may easily enough have\nsecured me from envy and animosities; to be beloved, I do not say, but\nnever any man gave less occasion of being hated; but the coldness of my\nconversation has, reasonably enough, deprived me of the goodwill of many,\nwho are to be excused if they interpret it in another and worse sense.\n\nI am very capable of contracting and maintaining rare and exquisite\nfriendships; for by reason that I so greedily seize upon such\nacquaintance as fit my liking, I throw myself with such violence upon\nthem that I hardly fail to stick, and to make an impression where I hit;\nas I have often made happy proof.  In ordinary friendships I am somewhat\ncold and shy, for my motion is not natural, if not with full sail:\nbesides which, my fortune having in my youth given me a relish for one\nsole and perfect friendship, has, in truth, created in me a kind of\ndistaste to others, and too much imprinted in my fancy that it is a beast\nof company, as the ancient said, but not of the herd.--[Plutarch, On the\nPlurality of Friends, c.  2.]--And also I have a natural difficulty of\ncommunicating myself by halves, with the modifications and the servile\nand jealous prudence required in the conversation of numerous and\nimperfect friendships: and we are principally enjoined to these in this\nage of ours, when we cannot talk of the world but either with danger or\nfalsehood.\n\nYet do I very well discern that he who has the conveniences (I mean the\nessential conveniences) of life for his end, as I have, ought to fly\nthese difficulties and delicacy of humour, as much as the plague.  I\nshould commend a soul of several stages, that knows both how to stretch\nand to slacken itself; that finds itself at ease in all conditions\nwhither fortune leads it; that can discourse with a neighbour, of his\nbuilding, his hunting, his quarrels; that can chat with a carpenter or a\ngardener with pleasure.  I envy those who can render themselves familiar\nwith the meanest of their followers, and talk with them in their own way;\nand dislike the advice of Plato,  that men should always speak in a\nmagisterial tone to their servants, whether men or women, without being\nsometimes facetious and familiar; for besides the reasons I have given,\n\u2018tis inhuman and unjust to set so great a value upon this pitiful\nprerogative of fortune, and the polities wherein less disparity is\npermitted betwixt masters and servants seem to me the most equitable.\nOthers study how to raise and elevate their minds; I, how to humble mine\nand to bring it low; \u2018tis only vicious in extension:\n\n                   \u201cNarras et genus AEaci,\n                    Et pugnata sacro bella sub Ilio\n                    Quo Chium pretio cadum\n                    Mercemur, quis aquam temperet ignibus,\n                    Quo praebente domum, et quota,\n                    Pelignis caream frigoribus, taces.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cYou tell us long stories about the race of AEacus, and the battles\n     fought under sacred Ilium; but what to give for a cask of Chian\n     wine, who shall prepare the warm bath, and in whose house, and when\n     I may escape from the Pelignian cold, you do not tell us.\u201d\n      --Horace, Od., iii. 19, 3.]\n\nThus, as the Lacedaemonian valour stood in need of moderation, and of the\nsweet and harmonious sound of flutes to soften it in battle, lest they\nshould precipitate themselves into temerity and fury, whereas all other\nnations commonly make use of harsh and shrill sounds, and of loud and\nimperious cries, to incite and heat the soldier\u2019s courage to the last\ndegree; so, methinks, contrary to the usual method, in the practice of\nour minds, we have for the most part more need of lead than of wings; of\ntemperance and composedness than of ardour and agitation.  But, above all\nthings, \u2018tis in my opinion egregiously to play the fool, to put on the\ngrave airs of a man of lofty mind amongst those who are nothing of the\nsort: ever to speak in print (by the book),\n\n                    \u201cFavellare in puma di forchetta.\u201d\n\n          [\u201cTo talk with the point of a fork,\u201d (affectedly)]\n\nYou must let yourself down to those with whom you converse; and sometimes\naffect ignorance: lay aside power and subtilty in common conversation; to\npreserve decorum and order \u2018tis enough-nay, crawl on the earth, if they\nso desire it.\n\nThe learned often stumble at this stone; they will always be parading\ntheir pedantic science, and strew their books everywhere; they have, in\nthese days, so filled the cabinets and ears of the ladies with them, that\nif they have lost the substance, they at least retain the words; so as in\nall discourse upon all sorts of subjects, how mean and common soever,\nthey speak and write after a new and learned way,\n\n         \u201cHoc sermone pavent, hoc iram, gaudia, curas,\n          Hoc cuncta effundunt animi secreta; quid ultra?\n          Concumbunt docte;\u201d\n\n     [\u201cIn this language do they express their fears, their anger, their\n     joys, their cares; in this pour out all their secrets; what more?\n     they lie with their lovers learnedly.\u201d--Juvenal, vi. 189.]\n\nand quote Plato and Aquinas in things the first man they meet could\ndetermine as well; the learning that cannot penetrate their souls hangs\nstill upon the tongue. If people of quality will be persuaded by me, they\nshall content themselves with setting out their proper and natural\ntreasures; they conceal and cover their beauties under others that are\nnone of theirs: \u2018tis a great folly to put out their own light and shine\nby a borrowed lustre: they are interred and buried under \u2018de capsula\ntotae\u201d--[Painted and perfumed from head to foot.\u201d (Or:) \u201cas if they were\nthings carefully deposited in a band-box.\u201d--Seneca, Ep. 115]--It is\nbecause they do not sufficiently know themselves or do themselves\njustice: the world has nothing fairer than they; \u2018tis for them to honour\nthe arts, and to paint painting.  What need have they of anything but to\nlive beloved and honoured?  They have and know but too much for this:\nthey need do no more but rouse and heat a little the faculties they have\nof their own.  When I see them tampering with rhetoric, law, logic, and\nother drugs, so improper and unnecessary for their business, I begin to\nsuspect that the men who inspire them with such fancies, do it that they\nmay govern them upon that account; for what other excuse can I contrive?\nIt is enough that they can, without our instruction, compose the graces\nof their eyes to gaiety, severity, sweetness, and season a denial with\nasperity, suspense, or favour:  they need not another to interpret what\nwe speak for their service; with this knowledge, they command with a\nswitch, and rule both the tutors and the schools.  But if, nevertheless,\nit angers them to give place to us in anything whatever, and will, out of\ncuriosity, have their share in books, poetry is a diversion proper for\nthem; \u2018tis a wanton, subtle, dissembling, and prating art, all pleasure\nand all show, like themselves.  They may also abstract several\ncommodities from history.  In philosophy, out of the moral part of it,\nthey may select such instructions as will teach them to judge of our\nhumours and conditions, to defend themselves from our treacheries, to\nregulate the ardour of their own desires, to manage their liberty, to\nlengthen the pleasures of life, and gently to bear the inconstancy of a\nlover, the rudeness of a husband; and the importunity of years, wrinkles,\nand the like.  This is the utmost of what I would allow them in the\nsciences.\n\nThere are some particular natures that are private and retired: my\nnatural way is proper for communication, and apt to lay me open; I am all\nwithout and in sight, born for society and friendship.  The solitude that\nI love myself and recommend to others, is chiefly no other than to\nwithdraw my thoughts and affections into myself; to restrain and check,\nnot my steps, but my own cares and desires, resigning all foreign\nsolicitude, and mortally avoiding servitude and obligation, and not so\nmuch the crowd of men as the crowd of business.  Local solitude, to say\nthe truth, rather gives me more room and sets me more at large; I more\nreadily throw myself upon affairs of state and the world when I am alone.\nAt the Louvre and in the bustle of the court, I fold myself within my own\nskin; the crowd thrusts me upon myself; and I never entertain myself so\nwantonly, with so much licence, or so especially, as in places of respect\nand ceremonious prudence: our follies do not make me laugh, it is our\nwisdom which does.  I am naturally no enemy to a court, life; I have\ntherein passed a part of my own, and am of a humour cheerfully to\nfrequent great company, provided it be by intervals and at my own time:\nbut this softness of judgment whereof I speak ties me perforce to\nsolitude.  Even at home, amidst a numerous family, and in a house\nsufficiently frequented, I see people enough, but rarely such with whom I\ndelight to converse; and I there reserve both for myself and others an\nunusual liberty: there is in my house no such thing as ceremony,\nushering, or waiting upon people down to the coach, and such other\ntroublesome ceremonies as our courtesy enjoins (O the servile and\nimportunate custom!).  Every one there governs himself according to his\nown method; let who will speak his thoughts, I sit mute, meditating and\nshut up in my closet, without any offence to my guests.\n\nThe men whose society and familiarity I covet are those they call sincere\nand able men; and the image of these makes me disrelish the rest.  It is,\nif rightly taken, the rarest of our forms, and a form that we chiefly owe\nto nature.  The end of this commerce is simply privacy, frequentation and\nconference, the exercise of souls, without other fruit.  In our\ndiscourse, all subjects are alike to me; let there be neither weight, nor\ndepth, \u2018tis all one: there is yet grace and pertinency; all there is\ntinted with a mature and constant judgment, and mixed with goodness,\nfreedom, gaiety, and friendship.  \u2018Tis not only in talking of the affairs\nof kings and state that our wits discover their force and beauty, but\nevery whit as much in private conferences.  I understand my men even by\ntheir silence and smiles; and better discover them, perhaps, at table\nthan in the council.  Hippomachus said, very well, \u201cthat he could know\nthe good wrestlers by only seeing them walk in the street.\u201d  If learning\nplease to step into our talk, it shall not be rejected, not magisterial,\nimperious, and importunate, as-it commonly is, but suffragan and docile\nitself; we there only seek to pass away our time; when we have a mind to\nbe instructed and preached to, we will go seek this in its throne; please\nlet it humble itself to us for the nonce; for, useful and profitable as\nit is, I imagine that, at need, we may manage well enough without it, and\ndo our business without its assistance.  A well-descended soul, and\npractised in the conversation of men, will of herself render herself\nsufficiently agreeable; art is nothing but the counterpart and register\nof what such souls produce.\n\nThe conversation also of beautiful and honourable women is for me a sweet\ncommerce:\n\n               \u201cNam nos quoque oculos eruditos habemus.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cFor we also have eyes that are versed in the matter.\u201d\n      --Cicero, Paradox, v. 2.]\n\nIf the soul has not therein so much to enjoy, as in the first the bodily\nsenses, which participate more of this, bring it to a proportion next to,\nthough, in my opinion, not equal to the other.  But \u2018tis a commerce\nwherein a man must stand a little upon his guard, especially those, where\nthe body can do much, as in me.  I there scalded myself in my youth, and\nsuffered all the torments that poets say befall those who precipitate\nthemselves into love without order and judgment.  It is true that that\nwhipping has made me wiser since:\n\n              \u201cQuicumque Argolica de classe Capharea fugit,\n               Semper ab Euboicis vela retorquet aquis.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cWhoever of the Grecian fleet has escaped the Capharean rocks, ever\n     takes care to steer from the Euboean sea.\u201d--Ovid, Trist., i. i, 83.]\n\n\u2018Tis folly to fix all a man\u2019s thoughts upon it, and to engage in it with\na furious and indiscreet affection; but, on the other hand, to engage\nthere without love and without inclination, like comedians, to play a\ncommon part, without putting anything to it of his own but words, is\nindeed to provide for his safety, but, withal, after as cowardly a manner\nas he who should abandon his honour, profit, or pleasure for fear of\ndanger.  For it is certain that from such a practice, they who set it on\nfoot can expect no fruit that can please or satisfy a noble soul.  A man\nmust have, in good earnest, desired that which he, in good earnest,\nexpects to have a pleasure in enjoying; I say, though fortune should\nunjustly favour their dissimulation; which often falls out, because there\nis none of the sex, let her be as ugly as the devil, who does not think\nherself well worthy to be beloved, and who does not prefer herself before\nother women, either for her youth, the colour of her hair, or her\ngraceful motion (for there are no more women universally ugly, than there\nare women universally beautiful, and such of the Brahmin virgins as have\nnothing else to recommend them, the people being assembled by the common\ncrier to that effect, come out into the market-place to expose their\nmatrimonial parts to public view, to try if these at least are not of\ntemptation sufficient to get them a husband).  Consequently, there is not\none who does not easily suffer herself to be overcome by the first vow\nthat they make to serve her.  Now from this common and ordinary treachery\nof the men of the present day, that must fall out which we already\nexperimentally see, either that they rally together, and separate\nthemselves by themselves to evade us, or else form their discipline by\nthe example we give them, play their parts of the farce as we do ours,\nand give themselves up to the sport, without passion, care, or love;\n\n          \u201cNeque afl\u2019ectui suo, aut alieno, obnoxiae;\u201d\n\n     [\u201cNeither amenable to their own affections, nor those of others.\u201d\n      --Tacitus, Annal., xiii. 45.]\n\nbelieving, according to the persuasion of Lysias in Plato, that they may\nwith more utility and convenience surrender themselves up to us the less\nwe love them; where it will fall out, as in comedies, that the people\nwill have as much pleasure or more than the comedians.  For my part,\nI no more acknowledge a Venus without a Cupid than, a mother without\nissue: they are things that mutully lend and owe their essence to one\nanother.  Thus this cheat recoils upon him who is guilty of it; it does\nnot cost him much, indeed, but he also gets little or nothing by it.\nThey who have made Venus a goddess have taken notice that her principal\nbeauty was incorporeal and spiritual; but the Venus whom these people\nhunt after is not so much as human, nor indeed brutal; the very beasts\nwill not accept it so gross and so earthly; we see that imagination and\ndesire often heat and incite them before the body does; we see in both\nthe one sex and the other, they have in the herd choice and particular\nelection in their affections, and that they have amongst themselves a\nlong commerce of good will.  Even those to whom old age denies the\npractice of their desire, still tremble, neigh, and twitter for love; we\nsee them, before the act, full of hope and ardour, and when the body has\nplayed its game, yet please themselves with the sweet remembrance of the\npast delight; some that swell with pride after they have performed, and\nothers who, tired and sated, still by vociferation express a triumphing\njoy.  He who has nothing to do but only to discharge his body of a\nnatural necessity, need not trouble others with so curious preparations:\nit is not meat for a gross, coarse appetite.\n\nAs one who does not desire that men should think me better than I am,\nI will here say this as to the errors of my youth.  Not only from the\ndanger of impairing my health (and yet I could not be so careful but that\nI had two light mischances), but moreover upon the account of contempt,\nI have seldom given myself up to common and mercenary embraces: I would\nheighten the pleasure by the difficulty, by desire, and a certain kind of\nglory, and was of Tiberius\u2019s mind, who in his amours was as much taken\nwith modesty and birth as any other quality, and of the courtesan Flora\u2019s\nhumour, who never lent herself to less than a dictator, a consul, or a\ncensor, and took pleasure in the dignity of her lovers.  Doubtless pearls\nand gold tissue, titles and train, add something to it.\n\nAs to the rest, I had a great esteem for wit, provided the person was not\nexceptionable; for, to confess the truth, if the one or the other of\nthese two attractions must of necessity be wanting, I should rather have\nquitted that of the understanding, that has its use in better things;\nbut in the subject of love, a subject principally relating to the senses\nof seeing and touching, something may be done without the graces of the\nmind: without the graces of the body, nothing.  Beauty is the true\nprerogative of women, and so peculiarly their own, that ours, though\nnaturally requiring another sort of feature, is never in its lustre but\nwhen youthful and beardless, a sort of confused image of theirs.  \u2018Tis\nsaid that such as serve the Grand Signior upon the account of beauty, who\nare an infinite number, are, at the latest, dismissed at two-and-twenty\nyears of age.  Reason, prudence, and the offices of friendship are better\nfound amongst men, and therefore it is that they govern the affairs of\nthe world.\n\nThese two engagements are fortuitous, and depending upon others; the one\nis troublesome by its rarity, the other withers with age, so that they\ncould never have been sufficient for the business of my life.  That of\nbooks, which is the third, is much more certain, and much more our own.\nIt yields all other advantages to the two first, but has the constancy\nand facility of its service for its own share.  It goes side by side with\nme in my whole course, and everywhere is assisting me: it comforts me in\nold age and solitude; it eases me of a troublesome weight of idleness,\nand delivers me at all hours from company that I dislike: it blunts the\npoint of griefs, if they are not extreme, and have not got an entire\npossession of my soul.  To divert myself from a troublesome fancy, \u2018tis\nbut to run to my books; they presently fix me to them and drive the other\nout of my thoughts, and do not mutiny at seeing that I have only recourse\nto them for want of other more real, natural, and lively commodities;\nthey always receive me with the same kindness.  He may well go a foot,\nthey say, who leads his horse in his hand; and our James, King of Naples\nand Sicily, who, handsome, young and healthful, caused himself to be\ncarried about on a barrow, extended upon a pitiful mattress in a poor\nrobe of grey cloth, and a cap of the same, yet attended withal by a royal\ntrain, litters, led horses of all sorts, gentlemen and officers, did yet\nherein represent a tender and unsteady authority: \u201cThe sick man has not\nto complain who has his cure in his sleeve.\u201d  In the experience and\npractice of this maxim, which is a very true one, consists all the\nbenefit I reap from books.  As a matter of fact, I make no more use of\nthem, as it were, than those who know them not.  I enjoy them as misers\ndo their money, in knowing that I may enjoy them when I please: my mind\nis satisfied with this right of possession.  I never travel without\nbooks, either in peace or war; and yet sometimes I pass over several\ndays, and sometimes months, without looking on them.  I will read\nby-and-by, say I to myself, or to-morrow, or when I please; and in the\ninterim, time steals away without any inconvenience.  For it is not to be\nimagined to what degree I please myself and rest content in this\nconsideration, that I have them by me to divert myself with them when I\nam so disposed, and to call to mind what a refreshment they are to my\nlife.  \u2018Tis the best viaticum I have yet found out for this human\njourney, and I very much pity those men of understanding who are\nunprovided of it.  I the rather accept of any other sort of diversion,\nhow light soever, because this can never fail me.\n\nWhen at home, I a little more frequent my library, whence I overlook at\nonce all the concerns of my family.  \u2018Tis situated at the entrance into\nmy house, and I thence see under me my garden, court, and base-court, and\nalmost all parts of the building.  There I turn over now one book, and\nthen another, on various subjects, without method or design.  One while\nI meditate, another I record and dictate, as I walk to and fro, such\nwhimsies as these I present to you here.  \u2018Tis in the third storey of a\ntower, of which the ground-room is my chapel, the second storey a chamber\nwith a withdrawing-room and closet, where I often lie, to be more\nretired; and above is a great wardrobe.  This formerly was the most\nuseless part of the house.  I there pass away both most of the days of my\nlife and most of the hours of those days.  In the night I am never there.\nThere is by the side of it a cabinet handsome enough, with a fireplace\nvery commodiously contrived, and plenty of light; and were I not more\nafraid of the trouble than the expense--the trouble that frights me from\nall business--I could very easily adjoin on either side, and on the same\nfloor, a gallery of an hundred paces long and twelve broad, having found\nwalls already raised for some other design to the requisite height.\nEvery place of retirement requires a walk: my thoughts sleep if I sit\nstill: my fancy does not go by itself, as when my legs move it: and all\nthose who study without a book are in the same condition.  The figure of\nmy study is round, and there is no more open wall than what is taken up\nby my table and my chair, so that the remaining parts of the circle\npresent me a view of all my books at once, ranged upon five rows of\nshelves round about me.  It has three noble and free prospects, and is\nsixteen paces in diameter.  I am not so continually there in winter; for\nmy house is built upon an eminence, as its name imports, and no part of\nit is so much exposed to the wind and weather as this, which pleases me\nthe better, as being of more difficult access and a little remote, as\nwell upon the account of exercise, as also being there more retired from\nthe crowd.  \u2018Tis there that I am in my kingdom, and there I endeavour to\nmake myself an absolute monarch, and to sequester this one corner from\nall society, conjugal, filial, and civil; elsewhere I have but verbal\nauthority only, and of a confused essence.  That man, in my opinion, is\nvery miserable, who has not at home where to be by himself, where to\nentertain himself alone, or to conceal himself from others.  Ambition\nsufficiently plagues her proselytes, by keeping them always in show, like\nthe statue of a public, square:\n\n                    \u201cMagna servitus est magna fortuna.\u201d\n\n               [\u201cA great fortune is a great slavery.\u201d\n                --Seneca, De Consol. ad.  Polyb., c.  26.]\n\nThey cannot so much as be private in the watercloset.  I have thought\nnothing so severe in the austerity of life that our monks affect, as what\nI have observed in some of their communities; namely, by rule, to have a\nperpetual society of place, and numerous persons present in every action\nwhatever; and think it much more supportable to be always alone than\nnever to be so.\n\nIf any one shall tell me that it is to undervalue the Muses to make use\nof them only for sport and to pass away the time, I shall tell him, that\nhe does not know so well as I the value of the sport, the pleasure, and\nthe pastime; I can hardly forbear to add that all other end is\nridiculous.  I live from day to day, and, with reverence be it spoken, I\nonly live for myself; there all my designs terminate.  I studied, when\nyoung, for ostentation; since, to make myself a little wiser; and now for\nmy diversion, but never for any profit.  A vain and prodigal humour I had\nafter this sort of furniture, not only for the supplying my own need,\nbut, moreover, for ornament and outward show, I have since quite cured\nmyself of.\n\nBooks have many charming qualities to such as know how to choose them;\nbut every good has its ill; \u2018tis a pleasure that is not pure and clean,\nno more than others: it has its inconveniences, and great ones too.  The\nsoul indeed is exercised therein; but the body, the care of which I must\nwithal never neglect, remains in the meantime without action, and grows\nheavy and sombre.  I know no excess more prejudicial to me, nor more to\nbe avoided in this my declining age.\n\nThese have been my three favourite and particular occupations; I speak\nnot of those I owe to the world by civil obligation.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV.\n\nOF DIVERSION\n\nI was once employed in consoling a lady truly afflicted.  Most of their\nmournings are artificial and ceremonious:\n\n         \u201cUberibus semper lacrymis, semperque paratis,\n          In statione subatque expectantibus illam,\n          Quo jubeat manare modo.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cA woman has ever a fountain of tears ready to gush up whenever\n     she requires to make use of them.\u201d--Juvenal, vi. 272.]\n\nA man goes the wrong way to work when he opposes this passion; for\nopposition does but irritate and make them more obstinate in sorrow; the\nevil is exasperated by discussion.  We see, in common discourse, that\nwhat I have indifferently let fall from me, if any one takes it up to\ncontrovert it, I justify it with the best arguments I have; and much more\na thing wherein I had a real interest.  And besides, in so doing you\nenter roughly upon your operation; whereas the first addresses of a\nphysician to his patient should be gracious, gay, and pleasing; never did\nany ill-looking, morose physician do anything to purpose.  On the\ncontrary, then, a man should, at the first approaches, favour their grief\nand express some approbation of their sorrow.  By this intelligence you\nobtain credit to proceed further, and by a facile and insensible\ngradation fall into discourses more solid and proper for their cure.\nI, whose aim it was principally to gull the company who had their eyes\nfixed upon me, took it into my head only to palliate the disease.  And\nindeed I have found by experience that I have an unlucky hand in\npersuading.  My arguments are either too sharp and dry, or pressed too\nroughly, or not home enough.  After I had some time applied myself to her\ngrief, I did not attempt to cure her by strong and lively reasons, either\nbecause I had them not at hand, or because I thought to do my business\nbetter another way; neither did I make choice of any of those methods of\nconsolation which philosophy prescribes: that what we complain of is no\nevil, according to Cleanthes; that it is a light evil, according to the\nPeripatetics; that to bemoan one\u2019s self is an action neither commendable\nnor just, according to Chrysippus; nor this of Epicurus, more suitable to\nmy way, of shifting the thoughts from afflicting things to those that are\npleasing; nor making a bundle of all these together, to make use of upon\noccasion, according to Cicero; but, gently bending my discourse, and by\nlittle and little digressing, sometimes to subjects nearer, and sometimes\nmore remote from the purpose, according as she was more intent on what I\nsaid, I imperceptibly led her from that sorrowful thought, and kept her\ncalm and in good-humour whilst I continued there.  I herein made use of\ndiversion.  They who succeeded me in the same service did not, for all\nthat, find any amendment in her, for I had not gone to the root.\n\nI, peradventure, may elsewhere have glanced upon some sort of public\ndiversions; and the practice of military ones, which Pericles made use of\nin the Peloponnesian war, and a thousand others in other places, to\nwithdraw the adverse forces from their own countries, is too frequent in\nhistory.  It was an ingenious evasion whereby Monseigneur d\u2019Hempricourt\nsaved both himself and others in the city of Liege, into which the Duke\nof Burgundy, who kept it besieged, had made him enter to execute the\narticles of their promised surrender; the people, being assembled by\nnight to consider of it, began to mutiny against the agreement, and\nseveral of them resolved to fall upon the commissioners, whom they had in\ntheir power; he, feeling the gusts of this first popular storm, who were\ncoming to rush into his lodgings, suddenly sent out to them two of the\ninhabitants of the city (of whom he had some with him) with new and\nmilder terms to be proposed in their council, which he had then and there\ncontrived for his need: These two diverted the first tempest, carrying\nback the enraged rabble to the town-hall to hear and consider of what\nthey had to say.  The deliberation was short; a second storm arose as\nviolent as the other, whereupon he despatched four new mediators of the\nsame quality to meet them, protesting that he had now better conditions\nto present them with, and such as would give them absolute satisfaction,\nby which means the tumult was once more appeased, and the people again\nturned back to the conclave.  In fine, by this dispensation of\namusements, one after another, diverting their fury and dissipating it in\nfrivolous consultations, he laid it at last asleep till the day appeared,\nwhich was his principal end.\n\nThis other story that follows is also of the same category.  Atalanta, a\nvirgin of excelling beauty and of wonderful disposition of body, to\ndisengage herself from the crowd of a thousand suitors who sought her in\nmarriage, made this proposition, that she would accept of him for her\nhusband who should equal her in running, upon condition that they who\nfailed should lose their lives.  There were enough who thought the prize\nvery well worth the hazard, and who suffered the cruel penalty of the\ncontract.  Hippomenes, about to make trial after the rest, made his\naddress to the goddess of love, imploring her assistance; and she,\ngranting his request, gave him three golden apples, and instructed him\nhow to use them.  The race beginning, as Hippomenes perceived his\nmistress to press hard up to him; he, as it were by chance, let fall one\nof these apples; the maid, taken with the beauty of it, failed not to\nstep out of her way to pick it up:\n\n              \u201cObstupuit Virgo, nitidique cupidine pomi\n               Declinat cursus, aurumque volubile tollit.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThe virgin, astonished and attracted by the glittering apple,\n     stops her career, and seizes the rolling gold.\u201d\n      --Ovid, Metam., x. 666.]\n\nHe did the same, when he saw his time, by the second and the third, till\nby so diverting her, and making her lose so much ground, he won the race.\nWhen physicians cannot stop a catarrh, they divert and turn it into some\nother less dangerous part.  And I find also that this is the most\nordinary practice for the diseases of the mind:\n\n          \u201cAbducendus etiam nonnunquam animus est ad alia studia,\n          sollicitudines, curas, negotia: loci denique mutatione,\n          tanquam aegroti non convalescentes, saepe curandus est.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThe mind is sometimes to be diverted to other studies, thoughts,\n     cares, business: in fine, by change of place, as where sick persons\n     do not become convalescent.\u201d--Cicero, Tusc. Quaes., iv. 35.]\n\n\u2018Tis to little effect directly to jostle a man\u2019s infirmities; we neither\nmake him sustain nor repel the attack; we only make him decline and evade\nit.\n\nThis other lesson is too high and too difficult: \u2018tis for men of the\nfirst form of knowledge purely to insist upon the thing, to consider and\njudge it; it appertains to one sole Socrates to meet death with an\nordinary countenance, to grow acquainted with it, and to sport with it;\nhe seeks no consolation out of the thing itself; dying appears to him a\nnatural and indifferent accident; \u2018tis there that he fixes his sight and\nresolution, without looking elsewhere.  The disciples of Hegesias, who\nstarved themselves to death, animated thereunto by his fine lectures, and\nin such numbers that King Ptolemy ordered he should be forbidden to\nentertain his followers with such homicidal doctrines, did not consider\ndeath in itself, neither did they judge of it; it was not there they\nfixed their thoughts; they ran towards and aimed at a new being.\n\nThe poor wretches whom we see brought upon the scaffold, full of ardent\ndevotion, and therein, as much as in them lies, employing all their\nsenses, their ears in hearing the instructions given them, their eyes and\nhands lifted up towards heaven, their voices in loud prayers, with a\nvehement and continual emotion, do doubtless things very commendable and\nproper for such a necessity: we ought to commend them for their devotion,\nbut not properly for their constancy; they shun the encounter, they\ndivert their thoughts from the consideration of death, as children are\namused with some toy or other when the surgeon is going to give them a\nprick with his lancet.  I have seen some, who, casting their eyes upon\nthe dreadful instruments of death round about, have fainted, and\nfuriously turned their thoughts another way; such as are to pass a\nformidable precipice are advised either to shut their eyes or to look\nanother way.\n\nSubrius Flavius, being by Nero\u2019s command to be put to death, and by the\nhand of Niger, both of them great captains, when they lead him to the\nplace appointed for his execution, seeing the grave that Niger had caused\nto be hollowed to put him into ill-made: \u201cNeither is this,\u201d said he,\nturning to the soldiers who guarded him, \u201caccording to military\ndiscipline.\u201d  And to Niger, who exhorted him to keep his head firm: \u201cDo\nbut thou strike as firmly,\u201d said he.  And he very well foresaw what would\nfollow when he said so; for Niger\u2019s arm so trembled that he had several\nblows at his head before he could cut it off.  This man seems to have had\nhis thoughts rightly fixed upon the subject.\n\nHe who dies in a battle, with his sword in his hand, does not then think\nof death; he feels or considers it not; the ardour of the fight diverts\nhis thought another way.  A worthy man of my acquaintance, falling as he\nwas fighting a duel, and feeling himself nailed to the earth by nine or\nten thrusts of his enemy, every one present called to him to think of his\nconscience; but he has since told me, that though he very well heard what\nthey said, it nothing moved him, and that he never thought of anything\nbut how to disengage and revenge himself.  He afterwards killed his man\nin that very duel.  He who brought to L. Silanus the sentence of death,\ndid him a very great kindness, in that, having received his answer, that\nhe was well prepared to die, but not by base hands, he ran upon him with\nhis soldiers to force him, and as he, unarmed as he was, obstinately\ndefended himself with his fists and feet, he made him lose his life in\nthe contest, by that means dissipating and diverting in a sudden and\nfurious rage the painful apprehension of the lingering death to which he\nwas designed.\n\nWe always think of something else; either the hope of a better life\ncomforts and supports us, or the hope of our children\u2019s worth, or the\nfuture glory of our name, or the leaving behind the evils of this life,\nor the vengeance that threatens those who are the causes of our death,\nadministers consolation to us:\n\n         \u201cSpero equidem mediis, si quid pia numina possunt,\n          Supplicia hausurum scopulis, et nomine Dido\n          Saepe vocaturum .  .  .  .\n          Audiam; et haec Manes veniet mihi fama sub imos.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cI hope, however, if the pious gods have any power, thou wilt feel\n     thy punishment amid the rocks, and will call on the name of Dido;\n     I shall hear, and this report will come to me below.\u201d--AEneid, iv.\n     382, 387.]\n\nXenophon was sacrificing with a crown upon his head when one came to\nbring him news of the death of his son Gryllus, slain in the battle of\nMantinea: at the first surprise of the news, he threw his crown to the\nground; but understanding by the sequel of the narrative the manner of a\nmost brave and valiant death, he took it up and replaced it upon his\nhead.  Epicurus himself, at his death, consoles himself upon the utility\nand eternity of his writings:\n\n          \u201cOmnes clari et nobilitati labores fiunt tolerabiles;\u201d\n\n     [\u201cAll labours that are illustrious and famous become supportable.\u201d\n      --Cicero, Tusc.  Quaes., ii. 26.]\n\nand the same wound, the same fatigue, is not, says Xenophon, so\nintolerable to a general of an army as to a common soldier.  Epaminondas\ntook his death much more cheerfully, having been informed that the\nvictory remained to him:\n\n          \u201cHaec sunt solatia, haec fomenta summorum dolorum;\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThese are sedatives and alleviations to the greatest pains.\u201d\n      --Cicero, Tusc. Quaes., ii.  23.]\n\nand such like circumstances amuse, divert, and turn our thoughts from the\nconsideration of the thing in itself.  Even the arguments of philosophy\nare always edging and glancing on the matter, so as scarce to rub its\ncrust; the greatest man of the first philosophical school, and\nsuperintendent over all the rest, the great Zeno, forms this syllogism\nagainst death: \u201cNo evil is honourable; but death is honourable; therefore\ndeath is no evil\u201d; against drunkenness this: \u201cNo one commits his secrets\nto a drunkard; but every one commits his secrets to a wise man: therefore\na wise man is no drunkard.\u201d  Is this to hit the white?  I love to see\nthat these great and leading souls cannot rid themselves of our company:\nperfect men as they are, they are yet simply men.\n\nRevenge is a sweet passion, of great and natural impression; I discern it\nwell enough, though I have no manner of experience of it.  From this not\nlong ago to divert a young prince, I did not tell him that he must, to\nhim that had struck him upon the one cheek, turn the other, upon account\nof charity; nor go about to represent to him the tragical events that\npoetry attributes to this passion.  I left that behind; and I busied\nmyself to make him relish the beauty of a contrary image: and, by\nrepresenting to him what honour, esteem, and goodwill he would acquire by\nclemency and good nature, diverted him to ambition.  Thus a man is to\ndeal in such cases.\n\nIf your passion of love be too violent, disperse it, say they, and they\nsay true; for I have often tried it with advantage: break it into several\ndesires, of which let one be regent, if you will, over the rest; but,\nlest it should tyrannise and domineer over you, weaken and protract, by\ndividing and diverting it:\n\n               \u201cCum morosa vago singultiet inguine vena,\u201d\n\n     [\u201cWhen you are tormented with fierce desire, satisfy it with the\n     first person that presents herself.\u201d--Persius, Sat., vi. 73.]\n\n          \u201cConjicito humorem collectum in corpora quaeque,\u201d\n\n          [Lucretius, vi. 1062, to the like effect.]\n\nand provide for it in time, lest it prove troublesome to deal with, when\nit has once seized you:\n\n              \u201cSi non prima novis conturbes vulnera plagis,\n               Volgivagaque vagus venere ante recentia cures.\u201d\n\n          [\u201cUnless you cure old wounds by new.\u201d-Lucretius, iv. 1064.]\n\nI was once wounded with a vehement displeasure, and withal, more just\nthan vehement; I might peradventure have lost myself in it, if I had\nmerely trusted to my own strength.  Having need of a powerful diversion\nto disengage me, by art and study I became amorous, wherein I was\nassisted by my youth: love relieved and rescued me from the evil wherein\nfriendship had engaged me.  \u2018Tis in everything else the same; a violent\nimagination hath seized me: I find it a nearer way to change than to\nsubdue it: I depute, if not one contrary, yet another at least, in its\nplace.  Variation ever relieves, dissolves, and dissipates.\n\nIf I am not able to contend with it, I escape from it; and in avoiding\nit, slip out of the way, and make, my doubles; shifting place, business,\nand company, I secure myself in the crowd of other thoughts and fancies,\nwhere it loses my trace, and I escape.\n\nAfter the same manner does nature proceed, by the benefit of inconstancy;\nfor time, which she has given us for the sovereign physician of our\npassions, chiefly works by this, that supplying our imaginations with\nother and new affairs, it loosens and dissolves the first apprehension,\nhow strong soever.  A wise man little less sees his friend dying at the\nend of five-and-twenty years than on the first year; and according to\nEpicurus, no less at all; for he did not attribute any alleviation of\nafflictions, either to their foresight or their antiquity; but so many\nother thoughts traverse this, that it languishes and tires at last.\n\nAlcibiades, to divert the inclination of common rumours, cut off the ears\nand tail of his beautiful dog, and turned him out into the public place,\nto the end that, giving the people this occasion to prate, they might let\nhis other actions alone.  I have also seen, for this same end of\ndiverting the opinions and conjectures of the people and to stop their\nmouths, some women conceal their real affections by those that were only\ncounterfeit; but I have also seen some of them, who in counterfeiting\nhave suffered themselves to be caught indeed, and who have quitted the\ntrue and original affection for the feigned: and so have learned that\nthey who find their affections well placed are fools to consent to this\ndisguise: the public and favourable reception being only reserved for\nthis pretended lover, one may conclude him a fellow of very little\naddress and less wit, if he does not in the end put himself into your\nplace, and you into his; this is precisely to cut out and make up a shoe\nfor another to draw on.\n\nA little thing will turn and divert us, because a little thing holds us.\nWe do not much consider subjects in gross and singly; they are little and\nsuperficial circumstances, or images that touch us, and the outward\nuseless rinds that peel off from the subjects themselves:\n\n         \u201cFolliculos ut nunc teretes aestate cicadae\n          Linquunt.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cAs husks we find grasshoppers leave behind them in summer.\u201d\n      --Lucretius, v. 801.]\n\nEven Plutarch himself laments his daughter for the little apish tricks of\nher infancy.--[Consolation to his Wife on the Death of their Daughter,\nc. I.]--The remembrance of a farewell, of the particular grace of an\naction, of a last recommendation, afflict us.  The sight of Caesar\u2019s robe\ntroubled all Rome, which was more than his death had done.  Even the\nsound of names ringing in our ears, as \u201cmy poor master,\u201d--\u201cmy faithful\nfriend,\u201d--\u201calas, my dear father,\u201d or, \u201cmy sweet daughter,\u201d afflict us.\nWhen these repetitions annoy me, and that I examine it a little nearer,\nI find \u2018tis no other but a grammatical and word complaint; I am only\nwounded with the word and tone, as the exclamations of preachers very\noften work more upon their auditory than their reasons, and as the\npitiful eyes of a beast killed for our service; without my weighing or\npenetrating meanwhile into the true and solid essence of my subject:\n\n               \u201cHis se stimulis dolor ipse lacessit.\u201d\n\n          [\u201cWith these incitements grief provokes itself.\u201d\n           --Lucretius, ii. 42.]\n\nThese are the foundations of our mourning.\n\nThe obstinacy of my stone to all remedies especially those in my bladder,\nhas sometimes thrown me into so long suppressions of urine for three or\nfour days together, and so near death, that it had been folly to have\nhoped to evade it, and it was much rather to have been desired,\nconsidering the miseries I endure in those cruel fits.  Oh, that good\nemperor,  who caused criminals to be tied that they might die for want of\nurination, was a great master in the hangman\u2019s\u2019 science!  Finding myself\nin this condition, I considered by how many light causes and objects\nimagination nourished in me the regret of life; of what atoms the weight\nand difficulty of this dislodging was composed in my soul; to how many\nidle and frivolous thoughts we give way in so great an affair; a dog, a\nhorse, a book, a glass, and what not, were considered in my loss; to\nothers their ambitious hopes, their money, their knowledge, not less\nfoolish considerations in my opinion than mine.  I look upon death\ncarelessly when I look upon it universally as the end of life.  I insult\nover it in gross, but in detail it domineers over me: the tears of a\nfootman, the disposing of my clothes, the touch of a friendly hand, a\ncommon consolation, discourages and softens me.  So do the complaints in\ntragedies agitate our souls with grief; and the regrets of Dido and\nAriadne, impassionate even those who believe them not in Virgil and\nCatullus.  \u2018Tis a symptom of an obstinate and obdurate nature to be\nsensible of no emotion, as \u2018tis reported for a miracle of Polemon; but\nthen he did not so much as alter his countenance at the biting of a mad\ndog that tore away the calf of his leg; and no wisdom proceeds so far as\nto conceive so vivid and entire a cause of sorrow, by judgment that it\ndoes not suffer increase by its presence, when the eyes and ears have\ntheir share; parts that are not to be moved but by vain accidents.\n\nIs it reason that even the arts themselves should make an advantage of\nour natural stupidity and weakness?  An orator, says rhetoric in the\nfarce of his pleading, shall be moved with the sound of his own voice and\nfeigned emotions, and suffer himself to be imposed upon by the passion he\nrepresents; he will imprint in himself a true and real grief, by means of\nthe part he plays, to transmit it to the judges, who are yet less\nconcerned than he: as they do who are hired at funerals to assist in the\nceremony of sorrow, who sell their tears and mourning by weight and\nmeasure; for although they act in a borrowed form, nevertheless, by\nhabituating and settling their countenances to the occasion, \u2018tis most\ncertain they often are really affected with an actual sorrow.  I was one,\namongst several others of his friends, who conveyed the body of Monsieur\nde Grammont to Spissons from the siege of La Fere, where he was slain;\nI observed that in all places we passed through we filled the people we\nmet with lamentations and tears by the mere solemn pomp of our convoy,\nfor the name of the defunct was not there so much as known.  Quintilian\nreports as to have seen comedians so deeply engaged in a mourning part,\nthat they still wept in the retiring room, and who, having taken upon\nthem to stir up passion in another, have themselves espoused it to that\ndegree as to find themselves infected with it, not only to tears, but,\nmoreover, with pallor and the comportment of men really overwhelmed with\ngrief.\n\nIn a country near our mountains the women play Priest Martin, for as they\naugment the regret of the deceased husband by the remembrance of the good\nand agreeable qualities he possessed, they also at the same time make a\nregister of and publish his imperfections; as if of themselves to enter\ninto some composition, and divert themselves from compassion to disdain.\nYet with much better grace than we, who, when we lose an acquaintance,\nstrive to give him new and false praises, and to make him quite another\nthing when we have lost sight of him than he appeared to us when we did\nsee him; as if regret were an instructive thing, or as if tears, by\nwashing our understandings, cleared them.  For my part, I henceforth\nrenounce all favourable testimonies men would give of me, not because I\nshall be worthy of them, but because I shall be dead.\n\nWhoever shall ask a man, \u201cWhat interest have you in this siege?\u201d\n --\u201cThe interest of example,\u201d he will say, \u201cand of the common obedience to\nmy prince: I pretend to no profit by it; and for glory, I know how small\na part can affect a private man such as I: I have here neither passion\nnor quarrel.\u201d  And yet you shall see him the next day quite another man,\nchafing and red with fury, ranged in battle for the assault; \u2018tis the\nglittering of so much steel, the fire and noise of our cannon and drums,\nthat have infused this new rigidity and fury into his veins.  A frivolous\ncause, you will say.  How a cause?  There needs none to agitate the mind;\na mere whimsy without body and without subject will rule and agitate it.\nLet me thing of building castles in Spain, my imagination suggests to me\nconveniences and pleasures with which my soul is really tickled and\npleased.  How often do we torment our mind with anger or sorrow by such\nshadows, and engage ourselves in fantastic passions that impair both soul\nand body?  What astonished, fleeting, confused grimaces does this raving\nput our faces into! what sallies and agitations both of members and\nvoices does it inspire us with!  Does it not seem that this individual\nman has false visions amid the crowd of others with whom he has to do,\nor that he is possessed with some internal demon that persecutes him?\nInquire of yourself where is the object of this mutation?  is there\nanything but us in nature which inanity sustains, over which it has\npower?  Cambyses, from having dreamt that his brother should be one day\nking of Persia, put him to death: a beloved brother, and one in whom he\nhad always confided.  Aristodemus, king of the Messenians, killed himself\nout of a fancy of ill omen, from I know not what howling of his dogs;\nand King Midas did as much upon the account of some foolish dream he had\ndreamed.  \u2018Tis to prize life at its just value, to abandon it for a\ndream.  And yet hear the soul triumph over the miseries and weakness of\nthe body, and that it is exposed to all attacks and alterations; truly,\nit has reason so to speak!\n\n              \u201cO prima infelix finger ti terra Prometheo!\n               Ille parum cauti pectoris egit opus\n               Corpora disponens, mentem non vidit in arte;\n               Recta animi primum debuit esse via.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cO wretched clay, first formed by Prometheus.

A man should have his soul instructed in\nthe means to sustain and to contend with evils, and in the rules of\nliving and believing well: and often rouse it up, and exercise it in this\nnoble study; but in an ordinary soul it must be by intervals and with\nmoderation; it will otherwise grow besotted if continually intent upon\nit.  I found it necessary, when I was young, to put myself in mind and\nsolicit myself to keep me to my duty; gaiety and health do not, they say,\nso well agree with those grave and serious meditations: I am at present\nin another state: the conditions of age but too much put me in mind, urge\nme to wisdom, and preach to me.  From the excess of sprightliness I am\nfallen into that of severity, which is much more troublesome; and for\nthat reason I now and then suffer myself purposely a little to run into\ndisorder, and occupy my mind in wanton and youthful thoughts, wherewith\nit diverts itself.  I am of late but too reserved, too heavy, and too\nripe; years every day read to me lectures of coldness and temperance.\nThis body of mine avoids disorder and dreads it; \u2018tis now my body\u2019s turn\nto guide my mind towards reformation; it governs, in turn, and more\nrudely and imperiously than the other; it lets me not an hour alone,\nsleeping or waking, but is always preaching to me death, patience, and\nrepentance.  I now defend myself from temperance, as I have formerly done\nfrom pleasure; it draws me too much back, and even to stupidity.  Now I\nwill be master of myself, to all intents and purposes; wisdom has its\nexcesses, and has no less need of moderation than folly.  Therefore, lest\nI should wither, dry up, and overcharge myself with prudence, in the\nintervals and truces my infirmities allow me:\n\n               \u201cMens intenta suis ne seit usque malis.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThat my mind may not eternally be intent upon my ills.\u201d\n      --Ovid., Trist., iv. i, 4.]\n\nI gently turn aside, and avert my eyes from the stormy and cloudy sky I\nhave before me, which, thanks be to God, I regard without fear, but not\nwithout meditation and study, and amuse myself in the remembrance of my\nbetter years:\n\n                          \u201cAnimus quo perdidit, optat,\n               Atque in praeterita se totus imagine versat.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThe mind wishes to have what it has lost, and throws itself\n     wholly into memories of the past.\u201d--Petronius, c. 128.]\n\nLet childhood look forward and age backward; was not this the\nsignification of Janus\u2019 double face?  Let years draw me along if they\nwill, but it shall be backward; as long as my eyes can discern the\npleasant season expired, I shall now and then turn them that way; though\nit escape from my blood and veins, I shall not, however, root the image\nof it out of my memory:\n\n                                        \u201cHoc est\n                    Vivere bis, vita posse priore frui.\u201d\n\n     [\u201c\u2018Tis to live twice to be able to enjoy one\u2019s former life again.\u201d\n      --Martial, x. 23, 7.]\n\nPlato ordains that old men should be present at the exercises, dances,\nand sports of young people, that they may rejoice in others for the\nactivity and beauty of body which is no more in themselves, and call to\nmind the grace and comeliness of that flourishing age; and wills that in\nthese recreations the honour of the prize should be given to that young\nman who has most diverted the company.  I was formerly wont to mark\ncloudy and gloomy days as extraordinary; these are now my ordinary days;\nthe extraordinary are the clear and bright; I am ready to leap for joy,\nas for an unwonted favour, when nothing happens me.  Let me tickle\nmyself, I cannot force a poor smile from this wretched body of mine;\nI am only merry in conceit and in dreaming, by artifice to divert the\nmelancholy of age; but, in faith, it requires another remedy than a\ndream.  A weak contest of art against nature.  \u2018Tis great folly to\nlengthen and anticipate human incommodities, as every one does; I had\nrather be a less while old than be old before I am really so.\u2019 I seize on\neven the least occasions of pleasure I can meet.  I know very well, by\nhearsay, several sorts of prudent pleasures, effectually so, and glorious\nto boot; but opinion has not power enough over me to give me an appetite\nto them.  I covet not so much to have them magnanimous, magnificent, and\npompous, as I do to have them sweet, facile, and ready:\n\n               \u201cA natura discedimus; populo nos damus,\n               nullius rei bono auctori.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cWe depart from nature and give ourselves to the people, who\n     understand nothing.\u201d--Seneca, Ep., 99.]\n\nMy philosophy is in action, in natural and present practice, very little\nin fancy: what if I should take pleasure in playing at cob-nut or to whip\na top!\n\n               \u201cNon ponebat enim rumores ante salutem.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cHe did not sacrifice his health even to rumours.\u201d Ennius, apud\n     Cicero, De Offic., i. 24]\n\nPleasure is a quality of very little ambition; it thinks itself rich\nenough of itself without any addition of repute; and is best pleased\nwhere most retired.  A young man should be whipped who pretends to a\ntaste in wine and sauces; there was nothing which, at that age, I less\nvalued or knew: now I begin to learn; I am very much ashamed on\u2019t; but\nwhat should I do?  I am more ashamed and vexed at the occasions that put\nme upon\u2019t.  \u2018Tis for us to dote and trifle away the time, and for young\nmen to stand upon their reputation and nice punctilios; they are going\ntowards the world and the world\u2019s opinion; we are retiring from it:\n\n     \u201cSibi arma, sibi equos, sibi hastas, sibi clavam, sibi pilam,\n     sibi natationes, et cursus habeant: nobis senibus, ex lusionibus\n     multis, talos relinquant et tesseras;\u201d\n\n     [\u201cLet them reserve to themselves arms, horses, spears, clubs,\n     tennis, swimming, and races; and of all the sports leave to us old\n     men cards and dice.\u201d--Cicero, De Senec., c. 16.]\n\nthe laws themselves send us home.  I can do no less in favour of this\nwretched condition into which my age has thrown me than furnish it with\ntoys to play withal, as they do children; and, in truth, we become such.\nBoth wisdom and folly will have enough to do to support and relieve me by\nalternate services in this calamity of age:\n\n               \u201cMisce stultitiam consiliis brevem.\u201d\n\n          [\u201cMingle with counsels a brief interval of folly.\u201d\n           --Horace, Od., iv. 12, 27.]\n\nI accordingly avoid the lightest punctures; and those that formerly would\nnot have rippled the skin, now pierce me through and through: my habit of\nbody is now so naturally declining to ill:\n\n          \u201cIn fragili corpore odiosa omnis offensio est;\u201d\n\n          [\u201cIn a fragile body every shock is obnoxious.\u201d\n           --Cicero, De Senec., c.  18.]\n\n          \u201cMensque pati durum sustinet aegra nihil.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cAnd the infirm mind can bear no difficult exertion.\u201d\n      --Ovid, De Ponto., i.  5, 18.]\n\nI have ever been very susceptibly tender as to offences: I am much more\ntender now, and open throughout.\n\n               \u201cEt minimae vires frangere quassa valent.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cAnd little force suffices to break what was cracked before.\u201d\n      --Ovid, De Tris., iii. 11, 22.]\n\nMy judgment restrains me from kicking against and murmuring at the\ninconveniences that nature orders me to endure, but it does not take away\nmy feeling them: I, who have no other thing in my aim but to live and be\nmerry, would run from one end of the world to the other to seek out one\ngood year of pleasant and jocund tranquillity.  A melancholic and dull\ntranquillity may be enough for me, but it benumbs and stupefies me; I am\nnot contented with it.  If there be any person, any knot of good company\nin country or city, in France or elsewhere, resident or in motion, who\ncan like my humour, and whose humours I can like, let them but whistle\nand I will run and furnish them with essays in flesh and bone:\n\nSeeing it is the privilege of the mind to rescue itself from old age, I\nadvise mine to it with all the power I have; let it meanwhile continue\ngreen, and flourish if it can, like mistletoe upon a dead tree.  But I\nfear \u2018tis a traitor; it has contracted so strict a fraternity with the\nbody that it leaves me at every turn, to follow that in its need.  I\nwheedle and deal with it apart in vain; I try in vain to wean it from\nthis correspondence, to no effect; quote to it Seneca and Catullus, and\nladies and royal masques; if its companion have the stone, it seems to\nhave it too; even the faculties that are most peculiarly and properly its\nown cannot then perform their functions, but manifestly appear stupefied\nand asleep; there is no sprightliness in its productions, if there be not\nat the same time an equal proportion in the body too.\n\nOur masters are to blame, that in searching out the causes of the\nextraordinary emotions of the soul, besides attributing it to a divine\necstasy, love, martial fierceness, poesy, wine, they have not also\nattributed a part to health: a boiling, vigorous, full, and lazy health,\nsuch as formerly the verdure of youth and security, by fits, supplied me\nwithal; that fire of sprightliness and gaiety darts into the mind flashes\nthat are lively and bright beyond our natural light, and of all\nenthusiasms the most jovial, if not the most extravagant.\n\nIt is, then, no wonder if a contrary state stupefy and clog my spirit,\nand produce a contrary effect:\n\n          \u201cAd nullum consurgit opus, cum corpore languet;\u201d\n\n     [\u201cWhen the mind is languishing, the body is good for nothing.\u201d\n      (Or:) \u201cIt rises to no effort; it languishes with the body.\u201d\n      --Pseudo Gallus, i. 125.]\n\nand yet would have me obliged to it for giving, as it wants to make out,\nmuch less consent to this stupidity than is the ordinary case with men of\nmy age.  Let us, at least, whilst we have truce, drive away incommodities\nand difficulties from our commerce:\n\n          \u201cDum licet, obducta solvatur fronte senectus:\u201d\n\n     [\u201cWhilst we can, let us banish old age from the brow.\u201d\n      --Herod., Ep., xiii. 7.]\n\n               \u201cTetrica sunt amcenanda jocularibus.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cSour things are to be sweetened with those that are pleasant.\u201d\n      --Sidonius Apollin., Ep., i. 9.]\n\nI love a gay and civil wisdom, and fly from all sourness and austerity of\nmanners, all repellent, mien being suspected by me:\n\n               \u201cTristemque vultus tetrici arrogantiam:\u201d\n\n          [\u201cThe arrogant sadness of a crabbed face.\u201d--Auctor Incert.]\n\n               \u201cEt habet tristis quoque turba cinaedos.\u201d\n\n          [\u201cAnd the dull crowd also has its voluptuaries.\u201d (Or:)\n          \u201cAn austere countenance sometimes covers a debauched mind.\u201d\n           --Idem.]\n\nI am very much of Plato\u2019s opinion, who says that facile or harsh humours\nare great indications of the good or ill disposition of the mind.\nSocrates had a constant countenance, but serene and smiling, not sourly\naustere, like the elder Crassus, whom no one ever saw laugh.  Virtue is a\npleasant and gay quality.\n\nI know very well that few will quarrel with the licence of my writings,\nwho have not more to quarrel with in the licence of their own thoughts:\nI conform myself well enough to their inclinations, but I offend their\neyes.  \u2018Tis a fine humour to strain the writings of Plato, to wrest his\npretended intercourses with Phaedo, Dion, Stella, and Archeanassa:\n\n               \u201cNon pudeat dicere, quod non pudet sentire.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cLet us not be ashamed to speak what we are not ashamed to think.\u201d]\n\nI hate a froward and dismal spirit, that slips over all the pleasures of\nlife and seizes and feeds upon misfortunes; like flies, that cannot stick\nto a smooth and polished body, but fix and repose themselves upon craggy\nand rough places, and like cupping-glasses, that only suck and attract\nbad blood.\n\nAs to the rest, I have enjoined myself to dare to say all that I dare to\ndo; even thoughts that are not to be published, displease me; the worst\nof my actions and qualities do not appear to me so evil as I find it evil\nand base not to dare to own them.  Every one is wary and discreet in\nconfession, but men ought to be so in action; the boldness of doing ill\nis in some sort compensated and restrained by the boldness of confessing\nit.  Whoever will oblige himself to tell all, should oblige himself to do\nnothing that he must be forced to conceal.  I wish that this excessive\nlicence of mine may draw men to freedom, above these timorous and mincing\nvirtues sprung from our imperfections, and that at the expense of my\nimmoderation I may reduce them to reason.  A man must see and study his\nvice to correct it; they who conceal it from others, commonly conceal it\nfrom themselves; and do not think it close enough, if they themselves see\nit: they withdraw and disguise it from their own consciences:\n\n     \u201cQuare vitia sua nemo confitetur?  Quia etiam nunc in\n     illia est; somnium narrare vigilantis est.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cWhy does no man confess his vices?  because he is yet in them;\n     \u2018tis for a waking man to tell his dream.\u201d--Seneca, Ep., 53.]\n\nThe diseases of the body explain themselves by their increase; we find\nthat to be the gout which we called a rheum or a strain; the diseases of\nthe soul, the greater they are, keep, themselves the most obscure;\nthe most sick are the least sensible; therefore it is that with an\nunrelenting hand they most often, in full day, be taken to task, opened,\nand torn from the hollow of the heart.  As in doing well, so in doing\nill, the mere confession is sometimes satisfaction.  Is there any\ndeformity in doing amiss, that can excuse us from confessing ourselves?\nIt is so great a pain to me to dissemble, that I evade the trust of\nanother\u2019s secrets, wanting the courage to disavow my knowledge.  I can\nkeep silent, but deny I cannot without the greatest trouble and violence\nto myself imaginable to be very secret, a man must be so by nature, not\nby obligation.  \u2018Tis little worth, in the service of a prince, to be\nsecret, if a man be not a liar to boot.  If he who asked Thales the\nMilesian whether he ought solemnly to deny that he had committed\nadultery, had applied himself to me, I should have told him that he ought\nnot to do it; for I look upon lying as a worse fault than the other.\nThales advised him quite contrary, bidding him swear to shield the\ngreater fault by the less;\n\n     [Montaigne\u2019s memory here serves him ill, for the question being put\n     to Thales, his answer was: \u201cBut is not perjury worse than\n     adultery?\u201d--Diogenes Laertius, in vita, i. 36.]\n\nnevertheless, this counsel was not so much an election as a\nmultiplication of vice.  Upon which let us say this in passing, that we\ndeal liberally with a man of conscience when we propose to him some\ndifficulty in counterpoise of vice; but when we shut him up betwixt two\nvices, he is put to a hard choice as Origen was either to idolatrise or\nto suffer himself to be carnally abused by a great Ethiopian slave they\nbrought to him.  He submitted to the first condition, and wrongly, people\nsay.  Yet those women of our times are not much out, according to their\nerror, who protest they had rather burden their consciences with ten men\nthan one mass.\n\nIf it be indiscretion so to publish one\u2019s errors, yet there is no great\ndanger that it pass into example and custom; for Ariston said,  that the\nwinds men most fear are those that lay them open.  We must tuck up this\nridiculous rag that hides our manners: they send their consciences to the\nstews, and keep a starched countenance: even traitors and assassins\nespouse the laws of ceremony, and there fix their duty.  So that neither\ncan injustice complain of incivility, nor malice of indiscretion.  \u2018Tis\npity but a bad man should be a fool to boot, and that outward decency\nshould palliate his vice: this rough-cast only appertains to a good and\nsound wall, that deserves to be preserved and whited.\n\nIn favour of the Huguenots, who condemn our auricular and private\nconfession, I confess myself in public, religiously and purely: St.\nAugustin, Origeti, and Hippocrates have published the errors of their\nopinions; I, moreover, of my manners.  I am greedy of making myself\nknown, and I care not to how many, provided it be truly; or to say\nbetter, I hunger for nothing; but I mortally hate to be mistaken by those\nwho happen to learn my name.  He who does all things for honour and\nglory, what can he think to gain by shewing himself to the world in a\nvizor, and by concealing his true being from the people?  Praise a\nhumpback for his stature, he has reason to take it for an affront:\nif you are a coward, and men commend you for your valour, is it of you\nthey speak?  They take you for another.  I should like him as well who\nglorifies himself in the compliments and congees that are made him as if\nhe were master of the company, when he is one of the least of the train.\nArchelaus, king of Macedon, walking along the street, somebody threw\nwater on his head, which they who were with him said he ought to punish:\n\u201cAye, but,\u201d said he, \u201cwhoever it was, he did not throw the water upon me,\nbut upon him whom he took me to be.\u201d  Socrates being told that people\nspoke ill of him, \u201cNot at all,\u201d said he, \u201cthere is nothing, in me of what\nthey say.\u201d\n\nFor my part, if any one should recommend me as a good pilot, as being\nvery modest or very chaste, I should owe him no thanks; and so, whoever\nshould call me traitor, robber, or drunkard, I should be as little\nconcerned.  They who do not rightly know themselves, may feed themselves\nwith false approbations; not I, who see myself, and who examine myself\neven to my very bowels, and who very well know what is my due.  I am\ncontent to be less commended, provided I am better known.  I may be\nreputed a wise man in such a sort of wisdom as I take to be folly.\nI am vexed that my Essays only serve the ladies for a common piece of\nfurniture, and a piece for the hall; this chapter will make me part of\nthe water-closet.  I love to traffic with them a little in private;\npublic conversation is without favour and without savour.  In farewells,\nwe oftener than not heat our affections towards the things we take leave\nof; I take my last leave of the pleasures of this world: these are our\nlast embraces.\n\nBut let us come to my subject: what has the act of generation, so\nnatural, so necessary, and so just, done to men, to be a thing not to\nbe spoken of without blushing, and to be excluded from all serious and\nmoderate discourse?   We boldly pronounce kill, rob, betray, and that we\ndare only to do betwixt the teeth.  Is it to say, the less we expend in\nwords, we may pay so much the more in thinking?  For it is certain that\nthe words least in use, most seldom written, and best kept in, are the\nbest and most generally known: no age, no manners, are ignorant of them,\nno more than the word bread they imprint themselves in every one without\nbeing, expressed, without voice, and without figure; and the sex that\nmost practises it is bound to say least of it.  \u2018Tis an act that we have\nplaced in the franchise of silence, from which to take it is a crime even\nto accuse and judge it; neither dare we reprehend it but by periphrasis\nand picture.  A great favour to a criminal to be so execrable that\njustice thinks it unjust to touch and see him; free, and safe by the\nbenefit of the severity of his condemnation.  Is it not here as in matter\nof books, that sell better and become more public for being suppressed?\nFor my part, I will take Aristotle at his word, who says, that\n\u201cbashfulness is an ornament to youth, but a reproach to old age.\u201d  These\nverses are preached in the ancient school, a school that I much more\nadhere to than the modern: its virtues appear to me to be greater, and\nthe vices less:\n\n              \u201cCeux qui par trop fuyant Venus estrivent,\n               Faillent autant que ceulx qui trop la suyvent.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThey err as much who too much forbear Venus, as they who are too\n     frequent in her rites.\u201d--A translation by Amyot from Plutarch, A\n     philosopher should converse with princes.]\n\n              \u201cTu, dea, rerum naturam sola gubernas,\n               Nec sine to quicquam dias in luminis oras\n               Exoritur, neque fit laetum, nec amabile quidquam.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cGoddess, still thou alone governest nature, nor without thee\n     anything comes into light; nothing is pleasant, nothing joyful.\u201d\n      --Lucretius, i. 22.]\n\nI know not who could set Pallas and the Muses at variance with Venus, and\nmake them cold towards Love; but I see no deities so well met, or that\nare more indebted to one another.  Who will deprive the Muses of amorous\nimaginations, will rob them of the best entertainment they have, and of\nthe noblest matter of their work: and who will make Love lose the\ncommunication and service of poesy, will disarm him of his best weapons:\nby this means they charge the god of familiarity and good will, and the\nprotecting goddesses of humanity and justice, with the vice of\ningratitude and unthankfulness.  I have not been so long cashiered from\nthe state and service of this god, that my memory is not still perfect in\nhis force and value:\n\n               \u201cAgnosco veteris vestigia flammae;\u201d\n\n     [\u201cI recognise vestiges of my old flame.\u201d--AEneid., iv. 23.]\n\nThere are yet some remains of heat and emotion after the fever:\n\n          \u201cNec mihi deficiat calor hic, hiemantibus annis!\u201d\n\n     [\u201cNor let this heat of youth fail me in my winter years.\u201d]\n\nWithered and drooping as I am, I feel yet some remains of the past\nardour:\n\n              \u201cQual l\u2019alto Egeo, per the Aquilone o Noto\n               Cessi, the tutto prima il volse et scosse,\n               Non \u2018s accheta ei pero; ma\u2019l suono e\u2019l moto\n               Ritien del l\u2019onde anco agitate e grosse:\u201d\n\n          [\u201cAs Aegean seas, when storms be calmed again,\n          That rolled their tumbling waves with troublous blasts,\n          Do yet of tempests passed some show retain,\n          And here and there their swelling billows cast.\u201d--Fairfax.]\n\nbut from what I understand of it, the force and power of this god are\nmore lively and animated in the picture of poesy than in their own\nessence:\n\n                    \u201cEt versus digitos habet:\u201d\n\n          [\u201cVerse has fingers.\u201d--Altered from Juvenal, iv. 196.]\n\nit has I know not what kind of air, more amorous than love itself.  Venus\nis not so beautiful, naked, alive, and panting, as she is here in Virgil:\n\n         \u201cDixerat; et niveis hinc atque hinc Diva lacertis\n          Cunctantem amplexu molli fovet.  Ille repente\n          Accepit solitam flammam; notusque medullas\n          Intravit calor, et labefacta per ossa cucurrit\n          Non secus atque olim tonitru, cum rupta corusco\n          Ignea rima micans percurrit lumine nimbos.\n          . . . . . .  Ea verba loquutus,\n          Optatos dedit amplexus; placidumque petivit\n          Conjugis infusus gremio per membra soporem.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThe goddess spoke, and throwing round him her snowy arms in soft\n     embraces, caresses him hesitating.  Suddenly he caught the wonted\n     flame, and the well-known warmth pierced his marrow, and ran\n     thrilling through his shaken bones: just as when at times, with\n     thunder, a stream of fire in lightning flashes shoots across the\n     skies.  Having spoken these words, he gave her the wished embrace,\n     and in the bosom of his spouse sought placid sleep.\u201d\n      --AEneid, viii.  387 and 392.]\n\nAll that I find fault with in considering it is, that he has represented\nher a little too passionate for a married Venus; in this discreet kind of\ncoupling, the appetite is not usually so wanton, but more grave and dull.\nLove hates that people should hold of any but itself, and goes but\nfaintly to work in familiarities derived from any other title, as\nmarriage is: alliance, dowry, therein sway by reason, as much or more\nthan grace and beauty.  Men do not marry for themselves, let them say\nwhat they will; they marry as much or more for their posterity and\nfamily; the custom and interest of marriage concern our race much more\nthan us; and therefore it is, that I like to have a match carried on by a\nthird hand rather than a man\u2019s own, and by another man\u2019s liking than that\nof the party himself; and how much is all this opposite to the\nconventions of love?  And also it is a kind of incest to employ in this\nvenerable and sacred alliance the heat and extravagance of amorous\nlicence, as I think I have said elsewhere.  A man, says Aristotle, must\napproach his wife with prudence and temperance, lest in dealing too\nlasciviously with her, the extreme pleasure make her exceed the bounds of\nreason.  What he says upon the account of conscience, the physicians say\nupon the account of health: \u201cthat a pleasure excessively lascivious,\nvoluptuous, and frequent, makes the seed too hot, and hinders\nconception\u201d: \u2018tis said, elsewhere, that to a languishing intercourse, as\nthis naturally is, to supply it with a due and fruitful heat, a man must\ndo it but seldom and at appreciable intervals:\n\n          \u201cQuo rapiat sitiens Venerem, interiusque recondat.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cBut let him thirstily snatch the joys of love and enclose them in\n     his bosom.\u201d--Virg., Georg., iii. 137.]\n\nI see no marriages where the conjugal compatibility sooner fails than\nthose that we contract upon the account of beauty and amorous desires;\nthere should be more solid and constant foundation, and they should\nproceed with greater circumspection; this furious ardour is worth\nnothing.\n\nThey who think they honour marriage by joining love to it, do, methinks,\nlike those who, to favour virtue, hold that nobility is nothing else but\nvirtue.  They are indeed things that have some relation to one another,\nbut there is a great deal of difference; we should not so mix their names\nand titles; \u2018tis a wrong to them both so to confound them.  Nobility is a\nbrave quality, and with good reason introduced; but forasmuch as \u2018tis a\nquality depending upon others, and may happen in a vicious person, in\nhimself nothing, \u2018tis in estimate infinitely below virtue\u2019;\n\n     [\u201cIf nobility be virtue, it loses its quality in all things wherein\n     not virtuous: and if it be not virtue, \u2018tis a small matter.\u201d\n      --La Byuyere.]\n\n\u2018tis a virtue, if it be one, that is artificial and apparent, depending\nupon time and fortune: various in form, according to the country; living\nand mortal; without birth, as the river Nile; genealogical and common;\nof succession and similitude; drawn by consequence, and a very weak one.\nKnowledge, strength, goodness, beauty, riches, and all other qualities,\nfall into communication and commerce, but this is consummated in itself,\nand of no use to the service of others.  There was proposed to one of our\nkings the choice of two candidates for the same command, of whom one was\na gentleman, the other not; he ordered that, without respect to quality,\nthey should choose him who had the most merit; but where the worth of the\ncompetitors should appear to be entirely equal, they should have respect\nto birth: this was justly to give it its rank.  A young man unknown,\ncoming to Antigonus to make suit for his father\u2019s command, a valiant man\nlately dead: \u201cFriend,\u201d said he, \u201cin such preferments as these, I have not\nso much regard to the nobility of my soldiers as to their prowess.\u201d\n And, indeed, it ought not to go as it did with the officers of the kings\nof Sparta, trumpeters, fiddlers, cooks, the children of whom always\nsucceeded to their places, how ignorant soever, and were preferred before\nthe most experienced in the trade.  They of Calicut make of nobles a sort\nof superhuman persons: they are interdicted marriage and all but warlike\nemployments: they may have of concubines their fill, and the women as\nmany lovers, without being jealous of one another; but \u2018tis a capital and\nirremissible crime to couple with a person of meaner conditions than\nthemselves; and they think themselves polluted, if they have but touched\none in walking along; and supposing their nobility to be marvellously\ninterested and injured in it, kill such as only approach a little too\nnear them: insomuch that the ignoble are obliged to cry out as they walk,\nlike the gondoliers of Venice, at the turnings of streets for fear of\njostling; and the nobles command them to step aside to what part they\nplease: by that means these avoid what they repute a perpetual ignominy,\nthose certain death.  No time, no favour of the prince, no office, or\nvirtue, or riches, can ever prevail to make a plebeian become noble: to\nwhich this custom contributes, that marriages are interdicted betwixt\ndifferent trades; the daughter of one of the cordwainers\u2019 gild is not\npermitted to marry a carpenter; and parents are obliged to train up their\nchildren precisely in their own callings, and not put them to any other\ntrade; by which means the distinction and continuance of their fortunes\nare maintained.\n\nA good marriage, if there be any such, rejects the company and conditions\nof love, and tries to represent those of friendship.  \u2018Tis a sweet\nsociety of life, full of constancy, trust, and an infinite number of\nuseful and solid services and mutual obligations; which any woman who has\na right taste:\n\n                    \u201cOptato quam junxit lumine taeda\u201d--\n\n     [\u201cWhom the marriage torch has joined with the desired light.\u201d\n      --Catullus, lxiv. 79.]\n\nwould be loth to serve her husband in quality of a mistress.  If she be\nlodged in his affection as a wife, she is more honourably and securely\nplaced.  When he purports to be in love with another, and works all he\ncan to obtain his desire, let any one but ask him, on which he had rather\na disgrace should fall, his wife or his mistress, which of their\nmisfortunes would most afflict him, and to which of them he wishes the\nmost grandeur, the answer to these questions is out of dispute in a sound\nmarriage.\n\nAnd that so few are observed to be happy, is a token of its price and\nvalue.  If well formed and rightly taken, \u2018tis the best of all human\nsocieties; we cannot live without it, and yet we do nothing but decry it.\nIt happens, as with cages, the birds without despair to get in, and those\nwithin despair of getting out.  Socrates being asked, whether it was more\ncommodious to take a wife or not, \u201cLet a man take which course he will,\u201d\n said he; \u201che will repent.\u201d  \u2018Tis a contract to which the common\nsaying:\n\n                    \u201cHomo homini aut deus aut lupus,\u201d\n\n          [\u201cMan to man is either a god or a wolf.\u201d--Erasmus, Adag.]\n\nmay very fitly be applied; there must be a concurrence of many qualities\nin the construction.  It is found nowadays more convenient for simple and\nplebeian souls, where delights, curiosity, and idleness do not so much\ndisturb it; but extravagant humours, such as mine, that hate all sorts of\nobligation and restraint, are not so proper for it:\n\n               \u201cEt mihi dulce magis resoluto vivere collo.\u201d\n\n          [\u201cAnd it is sweet to me to live with a loosened neck.\u201d\n           --Pseudo Gallus, i. 61.]\n\nMight I have had my own will, I would not have married Wisdom herself, if\nshe would have had me.  But \u2018tis to much purpose to evade it; the common\ncustom and usance of life will have it so.  The most of my actions are\nguided by example, not by choice, and yet I did not go to it of my own\nvoluntary motion; I was led and drawn to it by extrinsic occasions; for\nnot only things that are incommodious in themselves, but also things\nhowever ugly, vicious, and to be avoided, may be rendered acceptable by\nsome condition or accident; so unsteady and vain is all human resolution!\nand I was persuaded to it, when worse prepared and less tractable than I\nam at present, that I have tried what it is: and as great a libertine as\nI am taken to be, I have in truth more strictly observed the laws of\nmarriage, than I either promised or expected.  \u2018Tis in vain to kick, when\na man has once put on his fetters: a man must prudently manage his\nliberty; but having once submitted to obligation, he must confine himself\nwithin the laws of common duty, at least, do what he can towards it.\nThey who engage in this contract, with a design to carry themselves in it\nwith hatred and contempt, do an unjust and inconvenient thing; and the\nfine rule that I hear pass from hand to hand amongst the women, as a\nsacred oracle:\n\n     [\u201cServe thy husband as thy master, but guard thyself against him as\n     from a traitor.\u201d]\n\nwhich is to say, comport thyself towards him with a dissembled, inimical,\nand distrustful reverence (a cry of war and defiance), is equally\ninjurious and hard.  I am too mild for such rugged designs: to say the\ntruth, I am not arrived to that perfection of ability and refinement of\nwit, to confound reason with injustice, and to laugh at all rule and\norder that does not please my palate; because I hate superstition, I do\nnot presently run into the contrary extreme of irreligion.\n\n     (If a man hate superstition he cannot love religion.  D.W.)\n\nIf a man does not always perform his duty, he ought at least to love and\nacknowledge it; \u2018tis treachery to marry without espousing.\n\nLet us proceed.\n\nOur poet represents a marriage happy in a good accord wherein\nnevertheless there is not much loyalty.  Does he mean, that it is not\nimpossible but a woman may give the reins to her own passion, and yield\nto the importunities of love, and yet reserve some duty toward marriage,\nand that it may be hurt, without being totally broken?  A serving man may\ncheat his master, whom nevertheless he does not hate.  Beauty,\nopportunity, and destiny (for destiny has also a hand in\u2019t),\n\n                         \u201cFatum est in partibus illis\n          Quas sinus abscondit; nam, si tibi sidera cessent,\n          Nil faciet longi mensura incognita nervi;\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThere is a fatality about the hidden parts: let nature have\n     endowed you however liberally, \u2018tis of no use, if your good star\n     fails you in the nick of time.\u201d--Juvenal, ix. 32.]\n\nhave attached her to a stranger; though not so wholly, peradventure, but\nthat she may have some remains of kindness for her husband.  They are two\ndesigns, that have several paths leading to them, without being\nconfounded with one another; a woman may yield to a man she would by no\nmeans have married, not only for the condition of his fortune, but for\nthose also of his person.  Few men have made a wife of a mistress, who\nhave not repented it.  And even in the other world, what an unhappy life\ndoes Jupiter lead with his, whom he had first enjoyed as a mistress!\n\u2018Tis, as the proverb runs, to befoul a basket and then put it upon one\u2019s\nhead.  I have in my time, in a good family, seen love shamefully and\ndishonestly cured by marriage: the considerations are widely different.\nWe love at once, without any tie, two things contrary in themselves.\n\nSocrates was wont to say, that the city of Athens pleased, as ladies do\nwhom men court for love; every one loved to come thither to take a turn,\nand pass away his time; but no one liked it so well as to espouse it,\nthat is, to inhabit there, and to make it his constant residence.  I have\nbeen vexed to see husbands hate their wives only because they themselves\ndo them wrong; we should not, at all events, methinks, love them the less\nfor our own faults; they should at least, upon the account of repentance\nand compassion, be dearer to us.\n\nThey are different ends, he says, and yet in some sort compatible;\nmarriage has utility, justice, honour, and constancy for its share;\na flat, but more universal pleasure: love founds itself wholly upon\npleasure, and, indeed, has it more full, lively, and sharp; a pleasure\ninflamed by difficulty; there must be in it sting and smart: \u2018tis no\nlonger love, if without darts and fire.  The bounty of ladies is too\nprofuse in marriage, and dulls the point of affection and desire: to\nevade which inconvenience, do but observe what pains Lycurgus and Plato\ntake in their laws.\n\nWomen are not to blame at all, when they refuse the rules of life that\nare introduced into the world, forasmuch as the men make them without\ntheir help.  There is naturally contention and brawling betwixt them and\nus; and the strictest friendship we have with them is yet mixed with\ntumult and tempest.  In the opinion of our author, we deal\ninconsiderately with them in this: after we have discovered that they\nare, without comparison, more able and ardent in the practice of love\nthan we, and that the old priest testified as much, who had been one\nwhile a man, and then a woman:\n\n                    \u201cVenus huic erat utraque nota:\u201d\n\n               [\u201cBoth aspects of love were known to him,\u201d\n                --Tiresias. Ovid.  Metam., iii. 323.]\n\nand moreover, that we have learned from their own mouths the proof that,\nin several ages, was made by an Emperor and Empress of Rome,--[Proclus.]\n--both famous for ability in that affair!  for he in one night deflowered\nten Sarmatian virgins who were his captives: but she had five-and-twenty\nbouts in one night, changing her man according to her need and liking;\n\n                    \u201cAdhuc ardens rigidae tentigine vulvae\n               Et lassata viris, nondum satiata, recessit:\u201d\n\n          [\u201cArdent still, she retired, fatigued, but not satisfied.\u201d\n           --Juvenal, vi. 128.]\n\nand that upon the dispute which happened in Cataluna, wherein a wife\ncomplaining of her husband\u2019s too frequent addresses to her, not so much,\nas I conceive, that she was incommodated by it (for I believe no miracles\nout of religion) as under this pretence, to curtail and curb in this,\nwhich is the fundamental act of marriage, the authority of husbands over\ntheir wives, and to shew that their frowardness and malignity go beyond\nthe nuptial bed, and spurn under foot even the graces and sweets of\nVenus; the husband, a man truly brutish and unnatural, replied, that even\non fasting days he could not subsist with less than ten courses:\nwhereupon came out that notable sentence of the Queen of Arragon, by\nwhich, after mature deliberation of her council, this good queen, to give\na rule and example to all succeeding ages of the moderation required in\na just marriage, set down six times a day as a legitimate and necessary\nstint; surrendering and quitting a great deal of the needs and desires of\nher sex, that she might, she said, establish an easy, and consequently, a\npermanent and immutable rule.  Hereupon the doctors cry out: what must\nthe female appetite and concupiscence be, when their reason, their\nreformation and virtue, are taxed at such a rate, considering the divers\njudgments of our appetites?  for Solon, master of the law school, taxes\nus but at three a month,--that men may not fail in point of conjugal\nfrequentation: after having, I say, believed and preached all this, we go\nand enjoin them continency for their particular share, and upon the last\nand extreme penalties.\n\nThere is no passion so hard to contend with as this, which we would have\nthem only resist, not simply as an ordinary vice, but as an execrable\nabomination, worse than irreligion and parricide; whilst we, at the same\ntime, go to\u2019t without offence or reproach.  Even those amongst us who\nhave tried the experiment have sufficiently confessed what difficulty, or\nrather impossibility, they have found by material remedies to subdue,\nweaken, and cool the body.  We, on the contrary, would have them at once\nsound, vigorous plump, high-fed, and chaste; that is to say, both hot and\ncold; for the marriage, which we tell them is to keep them from burning,\nis but small refreshment to them, as we order the matter.  If they take\none whose vigorous age is yet boiling, he will be proud to make it known\nelsewhere;\n\n                   \u201cSit tandem pudor; aut eamus in jus;\n                    Multis mentula millibus redempta,\n                    Non est haec tua, Basse; vendidisti;\u201d\n\n     [\u201cLet there be some shame, or we shall go to law: your vigour,\n     bought by your wife with many thousands, is no longer yours: thou\n     hast sold it.--\u201cMartial, xii. 90.]\n\nPolemon the philosopher was justly by his wife brought before the judge\nfor sowing in a barren field the seed that was due to one that was\nfruitful:  if, on the other hand, they take a decayed fellow, they are in\na worse condition in marriage than either maids or widows.  We think them\nwell provided for, because they have a man to lie with, as the Romans\nconcluded Clodia Laeta, a vestal nun, violated, because Caligula had\napproached her, though it was declared he did no more but approach her:\nbut, on the contrary, we by that increase their necessity, forasmuch as\nthe touch and company of any man whatever rouses their desires, that in\nsolitude would be more quiet.  And to the end, \u2018tis likely, that they\nmight render their chastity more meritorious by this circumstance and\nconsideration, Boleslas and Kinge his wife, kings of Poland, vowed it by\nmutual consent, being in bed together, on their very wedding day, and\nkept their vow in spite of all matrimonial conveniences.\n\nWe train them up from their infancy to the traffic of love; their grace,\ndressing, knowledge, language, and whole instruction tend that way: their\ngovernesses imprint nothing in them but the idea of love, if for nothing\nelse but by continually representing it to them, to give them a distaste\nfor it.  My daughter, the only child I have, is now of an age that\nforward young women are allowed to be married at; she is of a slow, thin,\nand tender complexion, and has accordingly been brought up by her mother\nafter a retired and particular manner, so that she but now begins to be\nweaned from her childish simplicity.  She was reading before me in a\nFrench book where the word \u2018fouteau\u2019, the name of a tree very well known,\noccurred;--[The beech-tree; the name resembles in sound an obscene\nFrench word.]--the woman, to whose conduct she is committed, stopped her\nshort a little roughly, and made her skip over that dangerous step.  I\nlet her alone, not to trouble their rules, for I never concern myself in\nthat sort of government; feminine polity has a mysterious procedure; we\nmust leave it to them; but if I am not mistaken the commerce of twenty\nlacquies could not, in six months\u2019 time, have so imprinted in her memory\nthe meaning, usage, and all the consequence of the sound of these wicked\nsyllables, as this good old woman did by reprimand and interdiction.\n\n                   \u201cMotus doceri gaudet Ionicos\n                    Matura virgo, et frangitur artibus;\n                    Jam nunc et incestos amores\n                    De tenero, meditatur ungui.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThe maid ripe for marriage delights to learn Ionic dances, and to\n     imitate those lascivious movements.  Nay, already from her infancy\n     she meditates criminal amours.\u201d--Horace, Od., iii.  6, 21., the text\n     has \u2018fingitur\u2019.]\n\nLet them but give themselves the rein a little, let them but enter into\nliberty of discourse, we are but children to them in this science.  Hear\nthem but describe our pursuits and conversation, they will very well make\nyou understand that we bring them nothing they have not known before, and\ndigested without our help.\n\n     [This sentence refers to a conversation between some young women in\n     his immediate neighbourhood, which the Essayist just below informs\n     us that he overheard, and which was too shocking for him to repeat.\n     It must have been tolerably bad.--Remark by the editor of a later\n     edition.]\n\nIs it, perhaps, as Plato says, that they have formerly been debauched\nyoung fellows?  I happened one day to be in a place where I could hear\nsome of their talk without suspicion; I am sorry I cannot repeat it.\nBy\u2019rlady, said I, we had need go study the phrases of Amadis, and the\ntales of Boccaccio and Aretin, to be able to discourse with them: we\nemploy our time to much purpose indeed.  There is neither word, example,\nnor step they are not more perfect in than our books; \u2018tis a discipline\nthat springs with their blood,\n\n                    \u201cEt mentem ipsa Venus dedit,\u201d\n\n               [\u201cVenus herself made them what they are,\u201d\n                --Virg., Georg., iii. 267.]\n\nwhich these good instructors, nature, youth, and health, are continually\ninspiring them with; they need not learn, they breed it:\n\n              \u201cNec tantum niveo gavisa est ulla columbo,\n               Compar, vel si quid dicitur improbius,\n               Oscula mordenti semper decerpere rostro,\n               Quantum praecipue multivola est mulier.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cNo milk-white dove, or if there be a thing more lascivious,\n     takes so much delight in kissing as woman, wishful for every man\n     she sees.\u201d--Catullus, lxvi. 125.]\n\nSo that if the natural violence of their desire were not a little\nrestrained by fear and honour, which were wisely contrived for them, we\nshould be all shamed.  All the motions in the world resolve into and tend\nto this conjunction; \u2018tis a matter infused throughout: \u2018tis a centre to\nwhich all things are directed.  We yet see the edicts of the old and wise\nRome made for the service of love, and the precepts of Socrates for the\ninstruction of courtezans:\n\n                   \u201cNoncon libelli Stoici inter sericos\n                    Jacere pulvillos amant:\u201d\n\n          [\u201cThere are writings of the Stoics which we find lying upon\n          silken cushions.\u201d--Horace, Epod., viii. 15.]\n\nZeno, amongst his laws, also regulated the motions to be observed in\ngetting a maidenhead.  What was the philosopher Strato\u2019s book Of Carnal\nConjunction?--[ Diogenes Laertius, v.  59.]--And what did Theophrastus\ntreat of in those he intituled, the one \u2018The Lover\u2019, and the other \u2018Of\nLove?\u2019  Of what Aristippus in his \u2018Of Former Delights\u2019?

The amorous dialogues of Sphaereus? and the fable of Jupiter\nand Juno, of Chrysippus, impudent beyond all toleration?  And his fifty\nso lascivious epistles?  I will let alone the writings of the\nphilosophers of the Epicurean sect, protectress of voluptuousness.  Fifty\ndeities were, in time past, assigned to this office; and there have been\nnations where, to assuage the lust of those who came to their devotion,\nthey kept men and women in their temples for the worshippers to lie with;\nand it was an act of ceremony to do this before they went to prayers:\n\n     \u201cNimirum propter continentiam incontinentia necessaria est;\n     incendium ignibus extinguitur.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cForsooth incontinency is necessary for continency\u2019s sake; a\n     conflagration is extinguished by fire.\u201d]\n\nIn the greatest part of the world, that member of our body was deified;\nin the same province, some flayed off the skin to offer and consecrate a\npiece; others offered and consecrated their seed.  In another, the young\nmen publicly cut through betwixt the skin and the flesh of that part in\nseveral places, and thrust pieces of wood into the openings as long and\nthick as they would receive, and of these pieces of wood afterwards made\na fire as an offering to their gods; and were reputed neither vigorous\nnor chaste, if by the force of that cruel pain they seemed to be at all\ndismayed.  Elsewhere the most sacred magistrate was reverenced and\nacknowledged by that member and in several ceremonies the effigy of it\nwas carried in pomp to the honour of various divinities.  The Egyptian\nladies, in their Bacchanalia, each carried one finely-carved of wood\nabout their necks, as large and heavy as she could so carry it; besides\nwhich, the statue of their god presented one, which in greatness\nsurpassed all the rest of his body.--[Herodotus, ii.  48, says \u201cnearly\nas large as the body itself.\u201d]--The married women, near the place where\nI live, make of their kerchiefs the figure of one upon their foreheads,\nto glorify themselves in the enjoyment they have of it; and coming to be\nwidows, they throw it behind, and cover it with their headcloths.  The\nmost modest matrons of Rome thought it an honour to offer flowers and\ngarlands to the god Priapus; and they made the virgins, at the time of\ntheir espousals, sit upon his shameful parts.  And I know not whether I\nhave not in my time seen some air of like devotion.  What was the meaning\nof that ridiculous piece of the chaussuye of our forefathers, and that is\nstill worn by our Swiss? [\u201cCod-pieces worn\u201d--Cotton]--To what end do we\nmake a show of our implements in figure under our breeches, and often,\nwhich is worse, above their natural size, by falsehood and imposture?\nI have half a mind to believe that this sort of vestment was invented in\nthe better and more conscientious ages, that the world might not be\ndeceived, and that every one should give a public account of his\nproportions: the simple nations wear them yet, and near about the real\nsize.  In those days, the tailor took measure of it, as the shoemaker\ndoes now of a man\u2019s foot.

Quaes., iv. 33.]\n\nshould have called to mind, that, as in the mysteries of the Bona Dea,\nall masculine appearance was excluded, he did nothing, if he did not geld\nhorses and asses, in short, all nature:\n\n         \u201cOmne adeo genus in terris, hominumque, ferarumque,\n          Et genus aequoreum, pecudes, pictaeque volucres,\n          In furias ignemque ruunt.\u201d\n\n          [\u201cSo that all living things, men and animals, wild or tame,\n          and fish and gaudy fowl, rush to this flame of love.\u201d\n           --Virgil, Georg., iii. 244.]\n\nThe gods, says Plato, have given us one disobedient and unruly member\nthat, like a furious animal, attempts, by the violence of its appetite,\nto subject all things to it; and so they have given to women one like a\ngreedy and ravenous animal, which, if it be refused food in season, grows\nwild, impatient of delay, and infusing its rage into their bodies, stops\nthe passages, and hinders respiration, causing a thousand ills, till,\nhaving imbibed the fruit of the common thirst, it has plentifully bedewed\nthe bottom of their matrix.  Now my legislator--[The Pope who, as\nMontaigne has told us, took it into his head to geld the statues.]--\nshould also have considered that, peradventure, it were a chaster and\nmore fruitful usage to let them know the fact as it is betimes, than\npermit them to guess according to the liberty and heat of their own\nfancy; instead of the real parts they substitute, through hope and\ndesire, others that are three times more extravagant; and a certain\nfriend of mine lost himself by producing his in place and time when the\nopportunity was not present to put them to their more serious use.  What\nmischief do not those pictures of prodigious dimension do that the boys\nmake upon the staircases and galleries of the royal houses? they give the\nladies a cruel contempt of our natural furniture.  And what do we know\nbut that Plato, after other well-instituted republics, ordered that the\nmen and women, old and young, should expose themselves naked to the view\nof one another, in his gymnastic exercises, upon that very account?  The\nIndian women who see the men in their natural state, have at least cooled\nthe sense of seeing.  And let the women of the kingdom of Pegu say what\nthey will, who below the waist have nothing to cover them but a cloth\nslit before, and so strait, that what decency and modesty soever they\npretend by it, at every step all is to be seen, that it is an invention\nto allure the men to them, and to divert them from boys, to whom that\nnation is generally inclined; yet, peradventure they lose more by it than\nthey get, and one may venture to say, that an entire appetite is more\nsharp than one already half-glutted by the eyes.  Livia was wont to say,\nthat to a virtuous woman a naked man was but a statue.  The Lacedaemonian\nwomen, more virgins when wives than our daughters are, saw every day the\nyoung men of their city stripped naked in their exercises, themselves\nlittle heeding to cover their thighs in walking, believing themselves,\nsays Plato, sufficiently covered by their virtue without any other robe.\nBut those, of whom St. Augustin speaks, have given nudity a wonderful\npower of temptation, who have made it a doubt, whether women at the day\nof judgment shall rise again in their own sex, and not rather in ours,\nfor fear of tempting us again in that holy state.  In brief, we allure\nand flesh them by all sorts of ways: we incessantly heat and stir up\ntheir imagination, and then we find fault.  Let us confess the truth;\nthere is scarce one of us who does not more apprehend the shame that\naccrues to him by the vices of his wife than by his own, and that is not\nmore solicitous (a wonderful charity) of the conscience of his virtuous\nwife than of his own; who had not rather commit theft and sacrilege, and\nthat his wife was a murderess and a heretic, than that she should not be\nmore chaste than her husband: an unjust estimate of vices.  Both we and\nthey are capable of a thousand corruptions more prejudicial and unnatural\nthan lust: but we weigh vices, not according to nature, but according to\nour interest; by which means they take so many unequal forms.\n\nThe austerity of our decrees renders the application of women to this\nvice more violent and vicious than its own condition needs, and engages\nit in consequences worse than their cause: they will readily offer to go\nto the law courts to seek for gain, and to the wars to get reputation,\nrather than in the midst of ease and delights, to have to keep so\ndifficult a guard.  Do not they very well see that there is neither\nmerchant nor soldier who will not leave his business to run after this\nsport, or the porter or cobbler, toiled and tired out as they are with\nlabour and hunger?\n\n                   \u201cNum tu, qux tenuit dives Achaemenes,\n                    Aut pinguis Phrygiae Mygdonias opes,\n                    Permutare velis crine Licymnim?\n                    Plenas aut Arabum domos,\n                    Dum fragrantia detorquet ad oscula\n                    Cervicem, aut facili sxvitia negat,\n                    Quae poscente magis gaudeat eripi,\n                    Interdum rapere occupet?\u201d\n\n     [\u201cWouldst thou not exchange all that the wealthy Arhaemenes had,\n     or the Mygdonian riches of fertile Phrygia, for one ringlet of\n     Licymnia\u2019s hair?  or the treasures of the Arabians, when she turns\n     her head to you for fragrant kisses, or with easily assuaged anger\n     denies them, which she would rather by far you took by force, and\n     sometimes herself snatches one!\u201d--Horace, Od., ii. 12, 21.]\n\nI do not know whether the exploits of Alexander and Caesar really surpass\nthe resolution of a beautiful young woman, bred up after our fashion, in\nthe light and commerce of the world, assailed by so many contrary\nexamples, and yet keeping herself entire in the midst of a thousand\ncontinual and powerful solicitations.  There is no doing more difficult\nthan that not doing, nor more active:\n\nI hold it more easy to carry a suit of armour all the days of one\u2019s life\nthan a maidenhead; and the vow of virginity of all others is the most\nnoble, as being the hardest to keep:\n\n               \u201cDiaboli virtus in lumbis est,\u201d\n\nsays St.  Jerome.  We have, doubtless, resigned to the ladies the most\ndifficult and most vigorous of all human endeavours, and let us resign to\nthem the glory too.  This ought to encourage them to be obstinate in it;\n\u2018tis a brave thing for them to defy us, and to spurn under foot that vain\npre-eminence of valour and virtue that we pretend to have over them; they\nwill find if they do but observe it, that they will not only be much more\nesteemed for it, but also much more beloved.  A gallant man does not give\nover his pursuit for being refused, provided it be a refusal of chastity,\nand not of choice; we may swear, threaten, and complain to much purpose;\nwe therein do but lie, for we love them all the better: there is no\nallurement like modesty, if it be not rude and crabbed.  \u2018Tis stupidity\nand meanness to be obstinate against hatred and disdain; but against a\nvirtuous and constant resolution, mixed with goodwill, \u2018tis the exercise\nof a noble and generous soul.  They may acknowledge our service to a\ncertain degree, and give us civilly to understand that they disdain us\nnot; for the law that enjoins them to abominate us because we adore them,\nand to hate us because we love them, is certainly very cruel, if but for\nthe difficulty of it.  Why should they not give ear to our offers and\nrequests, so long as they are kept within the bounds of modesty?\nwherefore should we fancy them to have other thoughts within, and to be\nworse than they seem?  A queen of our time said with spirit, \u201cthat to\nrefuse these courtesies is a testimony of weakness in women and a\nself-accusation of facility, and that a lady could not boast of her\nchastity who was never tempted.\u201d\n\nThe limits of honour are not cut so short; they may give themselves a\nlittle rein, and relax a little without being faulty: there lies on the\nfrontier some space free, indifferent, and neuter.  He that has beaten\nand pursued her into her fort is a strange fellow if he be not satisfied\nwith his fortune: the price of the conquest is considered by the\ndifficulty.  Would you know what impression your service and merit have\nmade in her heart?  Judge of it by her behaviour.  Such an one may grant\nmore, who does not grant so much.  The obligation of a benefit wholly\nrelates to the good will of those who confer it: the other coincident\ncircumstances are dumb, dead, and casual; it costs her dearer to grant\nyou that little, than it would do her companion to grant all.  If in\nanything rarity give estimation, it ought especially in this: do not\nconsider how little it is that is given, but how few have it to give;\nthe value of money alters according to the coinage and stamp of the\nplace.  Whatever the spite and indiscretion of some may make them say in\nthe excess of their discontent, virtue and truth will in time recover all\nthe advantage.  I have known some whose reputation has for a great while\nsuffered under slander, who have afterwards been restored to the world\u2019s\nuniversal approbation by their mere constancy without care or artifice;\nevery one repents, and gives himself the lie for what he has believed and\nsaid; and from girls a little suspected they have been afterward advanced\nto the first rank amongst the ladies of honour.  Somebody told Plato that\nall the world spoke ill of him.  \u201cLet them talk,\u201d said he; \u201cI will live\nso as to make them change their note.\u201d  Besides the fear of God, and the\nvalue of so rare a glory, which ought to make them look to themselves,\nthe corruption of the age we live in compels them to it; and if I were\nthey, there is nothing I would not rather do than intrust my reputation\nin so dangerous hands.  In my time the pleasure of telling (a pleasure\nlittle inferior to that of doing) was not permitted but to those who had\nsome faithful and only friend; but now the ordinary discourse and common\ntable-talk is nothing but boasts of favours received and the secret\nliberality of ladies.  In earnest, \u2018tis too abject, too much meanness of\nspirit, in men to suffer such ungrateful, indiscreet, and giddy-headed\npeople so to persecute, forage, and rifle those tender and charming\nfavours.\n\nThis our immoderate and illegitimate exasperation against this vice\nsprings from the most vain and turbulent disease that afflicts human\nminds, which is jealousy:\n\n              \u201cQuis vetat apposito lumen de lumine sumi?\n               Dent licet assidue, nil tamen inde perit;\u201d\n\n     [\u201cWho says that one light should not be lighted from another light?\n     Let them give ever so much, as much ever remains to lose.\u201d--Ovid, De\n     Arte Amandi, iii. 93.  The measure of the last line is not good;\n     but the words are taken from the epigram in the Catalecta entitled\n     Priapus.]\n\nshe, and envy, her sister, seem to me to be the most foolish of the whole\ntroop.  As to the last, I can say little about it; \u2018tis a passion that,\nthough said to be so mighty and powerful, had never to do with me.  As to\nthe other, I know it by sight, and that\u2019s all.  Beasts feel it; the\nshepherd Cratis, having fallen in love with a she-goat, the he-goat, out\nof jealousy, came, as he lay asleep, to butt the head of the female, and\ncrushed it.  We have raised this fever to a greater excess by the\nexamples of some barbarous nations; the best disciplined have been\ntouched with it, and \u2018tis reason, but not transported:\n\n              \u201cEnse maritali nemo confossus adulter\n               Purpureo Stygias sanguine tinxit aquas.\u201d\n\n               [\u201cNever did adulterer slain by a husband\n               stain with purple blood the Stygian waters.\u201d]\n\nLucullus, Caesar, Pompey, Antony, Cato, and other brave men were\ncuckolds, and knew it, without making any bustle about it; there was in\nthose days but one coxcomb, Lepidus, that died for grief that his wife\nhad used him so.\n\n              \u201cAh! tum te miserum malique fati,\n               Quem attractis pedibus, patente porta,\n               Percurrent raphanique mugilesque:\u201d\n\n     [\u201cWretched man!  when, taken in the fact, thou wilt be\n     dragged out of doors by the heels, and suffer the punishment\n     of thy adultery.\u201d--Catullus, xv. 17.]\n\nand the god of our poet, when he surprised one of his companions with his\nwife, satisfied himself by putting them to shame only,\n\n               \u201cAtque aliquis de dis non tristibus optat\n               Sic fieri turpis:\u201d\n\n          [\u201cAnd one of the merry gods wishes that he should himself\n          like to be so disgraced.\u201d--Ovid, Metam., iv. 187.]\n\nand nevertheless took anger at the lukewarm embraces she gave him;\ncomplaining that upon that account she was grown jealous of his\naffection:\n\n               \u201cQuid causas petis ex alto? fiducia cessit\n               Quo tibi, diva, mei?\u201d\n\n     [\u201cDost thou seek causes from above?  Why, goddess, has your\n     confidence in me ceased?\u201d--Virgil, AEneid, viii. 395.]\n\nnay, she entreats arms for a bastard of hers,\n\n                    \u201cArena rogo genitrix nato.\u201d\n\n          [\u201cI, a mother, ask armour for a son.\u201d--Idem, ibid., 383.]\n\nwhich are freely granted; and Vulcan speaks honourably of AEneas,\n\n                    \u201cArma acri facienda viro,\u201d\n\n     [\u201cArms are to be made for a valiant hero.\u201d--AEneid, viii. 441.]\n\nwith, in truth, a more than human humanity.  And I am willing to leave\nthis excess of kindness to the gods:\n\n               \u201cNec divis homines componier aequum est.\u201d\n\n          [\u201cNor is it fit to compare men with gods.\u201d\n           --Catullus, lxviii. 141.]\n\nAs to the confusion of children, besides that the gravest legislators\nordain and affect it in their republics, it touches not the women, where\nthis passion is, I know not how, much better seated:\n\n               \u201cSaepe etiam Juno, maxima coelicolam,\n               Conjugis in culpa flagravit quotidiana.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cOften was Juno, greatest of the heaven-dwellers, enraged by her\n     husband\u2019s daily infidelities.\u201d--Idem, ibid.]\n\nWhen jealousy seizes these poor souls, weak and incapable of resistance,\n\u2018tis pity to see how miserably it torments and tyrannises over them; it\ninsinuates itself into them under the title of friendship, but after it\nhas once possessed them, the same causes that served for a foundation of\ngood-will serve them for a foundation of mortal hatred.  \u2018Tis, of all the\ndiseases of the mind, that which the most things serve for aliment and\nthe fewest for remedy: the virtue, health, merit, reputation of the\nhusband are incendiaries of their fury and ill-will:\n\n          \u201cNullae sunt inimicitiae, nisi amoris, acerbae.\u201d\n\n          [\u201cNo enmities are bitter, save that of love.\u201d\n           (Or:) \u201cNo hate is implacable except the hatred of love\u201d\n           --Propertius, ii. 8, 3.]\n\nThis fever defaces and corrupts all they have of beautiful and good\nbesides; and there is no action of a jealous woman, let her be how chaste\nand how good a housewife soever, that does not relish of anger and\nwrangling; \u2018tis a furious agitation, that rebounds them to an extremity\nquite contrary to its cause.  This held good with one Octavius at Rome.\nHaving lain with Pontia Posthumia, he augmented love with fruition, and\nsolicited with all importunity to marry her: unable to persuade her, this\nexcessive affection precipitated him to the effects of the most cruel and\nmortal hatred: he killed her.  In like manner, the ordinary symptoms of\nthis other amorous disease are intestine hatreds, private conspiracies,\nand cabals:\n\n               \u201cNotumque furens quid faemina possit,\u201d\n\n     [\u201cAnd it is known what an angry woman is capable of doing.\u201d\n      --AEneid, V. 21.]\n\nand a rage which so much the more frets itself, as it is compelled to\nexcuse itself by a pretence of good-will.\n\nNow, the duty of chastity is of a vast extent; is it the will that we\nwould have them restrain?  This is a very supple and active thing; a\nthing very nimble, to be stayed.  How? if dreams sometimes engage them so\nfar that they cannot deny them: it is not in them, nor, peradventure, in\nchastity itself, seeing that is a female, to defend itself from lust and\ndesire.  If we are only to trust to their will, what a case are we in,\nthen?  Do but imagine what crowding there would be amongst men in\npursuance of the privilege to run full speed, without tongue or eyes,\ninto every woman\u2019s arms who would accept them.  The Scythian women put\nout the eyes of all their slaves and prisoners of war, that they might\nhave their pleasure of them, and they never the wiser.  O, the furious\nadvantage of opportunity!  Should any one ask me, what was the first\nthing to be considered in love matters, I should answer that it was how\nto take a fitting time; and so the second; and so the third--\u2018tis a point\nthat can do everything.  I have sometimes wanted fortune, but I have also\nsometimes been wanting to myself in matters of attempt.  God help him,\nwho yet makes light of this!  There is greater temerity required in this\nage of ours, which our young men excuse under the name of heat; but\nshould women examine it more strictly, they would find that it rather\nproceeds from contempt.  I was always superstitiously afraid of giving\noffence, and have ever had a great respect for her I loved: besides, he\nwho in this traffic takes away the reverence, defaces at the same time\nthe lustre.  I would in this affair have a man a little play the child,\nthe timorous, and the servant.  If not this, I have in other bashfulness\nwhereof altogether in things some air of the foolish Plutarch makes\nmention; and the course of my life has been divers ways hurt and\nblemished with it; a quality very ill suiting my universal form: and,\nindeed, what are we but sedition and discrepancy?  I am as much out of\ncountenance to be denied as I am to deny; and it so much troubles me to\nbe troublesome to others that on occasion when duty compels me to try the\ngood-will of any one in a thing that is doubtful and that will be\nchargeable to him, I do it very faintly, and very much against my will:\nbut if it be for my own particular (whatever Homer truly says, that\nmodesty is a foolish virtue in an indigent person), I commonly commit it\nto a third person to blush for me, and deny those who employ me with the\nsame difficulty: so that it has sometimes befallen me to have had a mind\nto deny, when I had not the power to do it.\n\n\u2018Tis folly, then, to attempt to bridle in women a desire that is so\npowerful in them, and so natural to them.  And when I hear them brag of\nhaving so maidenly and so temperate a will, I laugh at them: they retire\ntoo far back.  If it be an old toothless trot, or a young dry consumptive\nthing, though it be not altogether to be believed, at least they say it\nwith more similitude of truth.  But they who still move and breathe, talk\nat that ridiculous rate to their own prejudice, by reason that\ninconsiderate excuses are a kind of self-accusation; like a gentleman, a\nneighbour of mine, suspected to be insufficient:\n\n              \u201cLanguidior tenera cui pendens sicula beta,\n               Numquam se mediam sustulit ad tunicam,\u201d\n\n          [Catullus, lxvii. 2, i.--The sense is in the context.]\n\nwho three or four days after he was married, to justify himself, went\nabout boldly swearing that he had ridden twenty stages the night before:\nan oath that was afterwards made use of to convict him of his ignorance\nin that affair, and to divorce him from his wife.  Besides, it signifies\nnothing, for there is neither continency nor virtue where there are no\nopposing desires.  It is true, they may say, but we will not yield;\nsaints themselves speak after that manner.  I mean those who boast in\ngood gravity of their coldness and insensibility, and who expect to be\nbelieved with a serious countenance; for when \u2018tis spoken with an\naffected look, when their eyes give the lie to their tongue, and when\nthey talk in the cant of their profession, which always goes against the\nhair, \u2018tis good sport.  I am a great servant of liberty and plainness;\nbut there is no remedy; if it be not wholly simple or childish, \u2018tis\nsilly, and unbecoming ladies in this commerce, and presently runs into\nimpudence.  Their disguises and figures only serve to cosen fools; lying\nis there in its seat of honour; \u2018tis a by-way, that by a back-door leads\nus to truth.  If we cannot curb their imagination, what would we have\nfrom them.  Effects?  There are enough of them that evade all foreign\ncommunication, by which chastity may be corrupted:\n\n               \u201cIllud saepe facit, quod sine teste facit;\u201d\n\n          [\u201cHe often does that which he does without a witness.\u201d\n           --Martial, vii. 62, 6.]\n\nand those which we fear the least are, peradventure, most to be feared;\ntheir sins that make the least noise are the worst:\n\n               \u201cOffendor maecha simpliciore minus.\u201d\n\n          [\u201cI am less offended with a more professed strumpet.\u201d\n           --Idem, vi. 7,6.]\n\nThere are ways by which they may lose their virginity without\nprostitution, and, which is more, without their knowledge:\n\n     \u201cObsterix, virginis cujusdam integritatem manu velut explorans, sive\n     malevolentia, sive inscitia, sive casu, dum inspicit, perdidit.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cBy malevolence, or unskilfulness, or accident, the midwife,\n     seeking with the hand to test some maiden\u2019s virginity, has sometimes\n     destroyed it.\u201d--St. Augustine, De Civit. Dei, i. 18.]\n\nSuch a one, by seeking her maidenhead, has lost it; another by playing\nwith it has destroyed it.  We cannot precisely circumscribe the actions,\nwe interdict them; they must guess at our meaning under general and\ndoubtful terms; the very idea we invent for their chastity is ridiculous:\nfor, amongst the greatest patterns that I have is Fatua, the wife of\nFaunus: who never, after her marriage, suffered herself to be seen by any\nman whatever; and the wife of Hiero, who never perceived her husband\u2019s\nstinking breath, imagining that it was common to all men.  They must\nbecome insensible and invisible to satisfy us.\n\nNow let us confess that the knot of this judgment of duty principally\nlies in the will; there have been husbands who have suffered cuckoldom,\nnot only without reproach or taking offence at their wives, but with\nsingular obligation to them and great commendation of their virtue.\nSuch a woman has been, who prized her honour above her life, and yet has\nprostituted it to the furious lust of a mortal enemy, to save her\nhusband\u2019s life, and who, in so doing, did that for him she would not have\ndone for herself!  This is not the place wherein we are to multiply these\nexamples; they are too high and rich to be set off with so poor a foil as\nI can give them here; let us reserve them for a nobler place; but for\nexamples of ordinary lustre, do we not every day see women amongst us who\nsurrender themselves for their husbands sole benefit, and by their\nexpress order and mediation? and, of old, Phaulius the Argian, who\noffered his to King Philip out of ambition; as Galba did it out of\ncivility, who, having entertained Maecenas at supper, and observing that\nhis wife and he began to cast glances at one another and to make eyes and\nsigns, let himself sink down upon his cushion, like one in a profound\nsleep, to give opportunity to their desires: which he handsomely\nconfessed, for thereupon a servant having made bold to lay hands on the\nplate upon the table, he frankly cried, \u201cWhat, you rogue? do you not see\nthat I only sleep for Maecenas?\u201d Such there may be, whose manners may be\nlewd enough, whose will may be more reformed than another, who outwardly\ncarries herself after a more regular manner.  As we see some who complain\nof having vowed chastity before they knew what they did; and I have also\nknown others really, complain of having been given up to debauchery\nbefore they were of the years of discretion.  The vice of the parents or\nthe impulse of nature, which is a rough counsellor, may be the cause.\n\nIn the East Indies, though chastity is of singular reputation, yet custom\npermitted a married woman to prostitute herself to any one who presented\nher with an elephant, and that with glory, to have been valued at so high\na rate.  Phaedo the philosopher, a man of birth, after the taking of his\ncountry Elis, made it his trade to prostitute the beauty of his youth, so\nlong as it lasted, to any one that would, for money thereby to gain his\nliving: and Solon was the first in Greece, \u2018tis said, who by his laws\ngave liberty to women, at the expense of their chastity, to provide for\nthe necessities of life; a custom that Herodotus says had been received\nin many governments before his time.  And besides, what fruit is there of\nthis painful solicitude?  For what justice soever there is in this\npassion, we are yet to consider whether it turns to account or no: does\nany one think to curb them, with all his industry?\n\n         \u201cPone seram; cohibe: sed quis custodiet ipsos\n          Custodes?  cauta est, et ab illis incipit uxor.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cPut on a lock; shut them up under a guard; but who shall guard\n     the guard?  she knows what she is about, and begins with them.\u201d\n      --Juvenal, vi. 346.]\n\nWhat commodity will not serve their turn, in so knowing an age?\n\nCuriosity is vicious throughout; but \u2018tis pernicious here.  \u2018Tis folly to\nexamine into a disease for which there is no physic that does not inflame\nand make it worse; of which the shame grows still greater and more public\nby jealousy, and of which the revenge more wounds our children than it\nheals us.  You wither and die in the search of so obscure a proof.  How\nmiserably have they of my time arrived at that knowledge who have been so\nunhappy as to have found it out?  If the informer does not at the same\ntime apply a remedy and bring relief, \u2018tis an injurious information, and\nthat better deserves a stab than the lie.  We no less laugh at him who\ntakes pains to prevent it, than at him who is a cuckold and knows it not.\nThe character of cuckold is indelible: who once has it carries it to his\ngrave; the punishment proclaims it more than the fault.  It is to much\npurpose to drag out of obscurity and doubt our private misfortunes,\nthence to expose them on tragic scaffolds; and misfortunes that only hurt\nus by being known; for we say a good wife or a happy marriage, not that\nthey are really so, but because no one says to the contrary.  Men should\nbe so discreet as to evade this tormenting and unprofitable knowledge:\nand the Romans had a custom, when returning from any expedition, to send\nhome before to acquaint their wives with their coming, that they might\nnot surprise them; and to this purpose it is that a certain nation has\nintroduced a custom, that the priest shall on the wedding-day open the\nway to the bride, to free the husband from the doubt and curiosity of\nexamining in the first assault, whether she comes a virgin to his bed, or\nhas been at the trade before.\n\nBut the world will be talking.  I know, a hundred honest men cuckolds,\nhonestly and not unbeseemingly; a worthy man is pitied, not disesteemed\nfor it.  Order it so that your virtue may conquer your misfortune; that\ngood men may curse the occasion, and that he who wrongs you may tremble\nbut to think on\u2019t.  And, moreover, who escapes being talked of at the\nsame rate, from the least even to the greatest?\n\n                    \u201cTot qui legionibus imperitivit\n          Et melior quam to multis fuit, improbe, rebus.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cMany who have commanded legions, many a man much better far than\n     you, you rascal.\u201d--Lucretius, iii. 1039, 1041.]\n\nSeest thou how many honest men are reproached with this in thy presence;\nbelieve that thou art no more spared elsewhere.  But, the very ladies\nwill be laughing too; and what are they so apt to laugh at in this\nvirtuous age of ours as at a peaceable and well-composed marriage?  Each\namongst you has made somebody cuckold; and nature runs much in parallel,\nin compensation, and turn for turn.  The frequency of this accident ought\nlong since to have made it more easy; \u2018tis now passed into custom.\n\nMiserable passion! which has this also, that it is incommunicable,\n\n          \u201cFors etiam nostris invidit questibus aures;\u201d\n\n          [\u201cFortune also refuses ear to our complaints.\u201d\n           --Catullus, lxvii.]\n\nfor to what friend dare you intrust your griefs, who, if he does not\nlaugh at them, will not make use of the occasion to get a share of the\nquarry?  The sharps, as well as the sweets of marriage, are kept secret\nby the wise; and amongst its other troublesome conditions this to a\nprating fellow, as I am, is one of the chief, that custom has rendered it\nindecent and prejudicial to communicate to any one all that a man knows\nand all that a man feels.  To give women the same counsel against\njealousy would be so much time lost; their very being is so made up of\nsuspicion, vanity, and curiosity, that to cure them by any legitimate way\nis not to be hoped.  They often recover of this infirmity by a form of\nhealth much more to be feared than the disease itself; for as there are\nenchantments that cannot take away the evil but by throwing it upon\nanother, they also willingly transfer this ever to their husbands, when\nthey shake it off themselves.  And yet I know not, to speak truth,\nwhether a man can suffer worse from them than their jealousy; \u2018tis the\nmost dangerous of all their conditions, as the head is of all their\nmembers.  Pittacus used to say,--[Plutarch, On Contentment, c. II.]--\nthat every one had his trouble, and that his was the jealous head of his\nwife; but for which he should think himself perfectly happy.  A mighty\ninconvenience, sure, which could poison the whole life of so just, so\nwise, and so valiant a man; what must we other little fellows do?  The\nsenate of Marseilles had reason to grant him his request who begged leave\nto kill himself that he might be delivered from the clamour of his wife;\nfor \u2018tis a mischief that is never removed but by removing the whole\npiece; and that has no remedy but flight or patience, though both of them\nvery hard.  He was, methinks, an understanding fellow who said, \u2018twas a\nhappy marriage betwixt a blind wife and a deaf husband.\n\nLet us also consider whether the great and violent severity of obligation\nwe enjoin them does not produce two effects contrary to our design\nnamely, whether it does not render the pursuants more eager to attack,\nand the women more easy to yield.  For as to the first, by raising the\nvalue of the place, we raise the value and the desire of the conquest.\nMight it not be Venus herself, who so cunningly enhanced the price of her\nmerchandise, by making the laws her bawds; knowing how insipid a delight\nit would be that was not heightened by fancy and hardness to achieve?\nIn short, \u2018tis all swine\u2019s flesh, varied by sauces, as Flaminius\u2019 host\nsaid.  Cupid is a roguish god, who makes it his sport to contend with\ndevotion and justice: \u2018tis his glory that his power mates all powers, and\nthat all other rules give place to his:\n\n               \u201cMateriam culpae prosequiturque suae.\u201d\n\n               [\u201cAnd seeks out a matter (motive) for his crimes.\u201d\n                --Ovid, Trist., iv. I. 34.]\n\nAs to the second point; should we not be less cuckolds, if we less feared\nto be so? according to the humour of women whom interdiction incites, and\nwho are more eager, being forbidden:\n\n              \u201cUbi velis, nolunt; ubi nolis, volunt ultro;\n               Concessa pudet ire via.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cWhere thou wilt, they won\u2019t; where thou wilt not, they\n     spontaneously agree; they are ashamed to go in the permitted path.\u201d\n      --Terence, Eunuchus, act iv., sc. 8, v  43]\n\nWhat better interpretation can we make of Messalina\u2019s behaviour?  She,\nat first, made her husband a cuckold in private, as is the common use;\nbut, bringing her business about with too much ease, by reason of her\nhusband\u2019s stupidity, she soon scorned that way, and presently fell to\nmaking open love, to own her lovers, and to favour and entertain them in\nthe sight of all: she would make him know and see how she used him.  This\nanimal, not to be roused with all this, and rendering her pleasures dull\nand flat by his too stupid facility, by which he seemed to authorise and\nmake them lawful; what does she?  Being the wife of a living and\nhealthful emperor, and at Rome, the theatre of the world, in the face of\nthe sun, and with solemn ceremony, and to Silius, who had long before\nenjoyed her, she publicly marries herself one day that her husband was\ngone out of the city.  Does it not seem as if she was going to become\nchaste by her husband\u2019s negligence? or that she sought another husband\nwho might sharpen her appetite by his jealousy, and who by watching\nshould incite her?  But the first difficulty she met with was also the\nlast: this beast suddenly roused these sleepy, sluggish sort of men are\noften the most dangerous: I have found by experience that this extreme\ntoleration, when it comes to dissolve, produces the most severe revenge;\nfor taking fire on a sudden, anger and fury being combined in one,\ndischarge their utmost force at the first onset,\n\n               \u201cIrarumque omnes effundit habenas:\u201d\n\n          [\u201cHe let loose his whole  fury.\u201d--AEneid, xii. 499.]\n\nhe put her to death, and with her a great number of those with whom she\nhad intelligence, and even one of them who could not help it, and whom\nshe had caused to be forced to her bed with scourges.\n\nWhat Virgil says of Venus and Vulcan, Lucretius had better expressed of a\nstolen enjoyment betwixt her and Mars:\n\n              \u201cBelli fera moenera Mavors\n               Armipotens regit, ingremium qui saepe tuum se\n               Rejictt, aeterno devinctus vulnere amoris\n                    ............................\n               Pascit amore avidos inhians in te, Dea, visus,\n               Eque tuo pendet resupini spiritus ore\n               Hunc tu, Diva, tuo recubantem corpore sancto\n               Circumfusa super, suaveis ex ore loquelas\n               Funde.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cMars, the god of wars, who controls the cruel tasks of war, often\n     reclines on thy bosom, and greedily drinks love at both his eyes,\n     vanquished by the eternal wound of love: and his breath, as he\n     reclines, hangs on thy lips; bending thy head over him as he lies\n     upon thy sacred person, pour forth sweet and persuasive words.\u201d\n      --Lucretius, i. 23.]\n\nWhen I consider this rejicit, fiascit, inhians, ynolli, fovet, medullas,\nlabefacta, pendet, percurrit, and that noble circumfusa, mother of the\npretty infuses; I disdain those little quibbles and verbal allusions that\nhave since sprung up.  Those worthy people stood in need of no subtlety\nto disguise their meaning; their language is downright, and full of\nnatural and continued vigour; they are all epigram; not only the tail,\nbut the head, body, and feet.  There is nothing forced, nothing\nlanguishing, but everything keeps the same pace:\n\n     \u201cContextus totes virilis est; non sunt circa flosculos occupati.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThe whole contexture is manly; they don\u2019t occupy themselves with\n     little flowers of rhetoric.\u201d--Seneca, Ep., 33.]\n\n\u2018Tis not a soft eloquence, and without offence only; \u2018tis nervous and\nsolid, that does not so much please, as it fills and ravishes the\ngreatest minds.  When I see these brave forms of expression, so lively,\nso profound, I do not say that \u2018tis well said, but well thought.  \u2018Tis\nthe sprightliness of the imagination that swells and elevates the words:\n\n                    \u201cPectus est quod disertum Tacit.\u201d\n\n          [\u201cThe heart makes the man eloquent.\u201d--Quintilian, x. 7.]\n\nOur people call language, judgment, and fine words, full conceptions.\nThis painting is not so much carried on by dexterity of hand as by having\nthe object more vividly imprinted in the soul.  Gallus speaks simply\nbecause he conceives simply: Horace does not content himself with a\nsuperficial expression; that would betray him; he sees farther and more\nclearly into things; his mind breaks into and rummages all the magazine\nof words and figures wherewith to express himself, and he must have them\nmore than ordinary, because his conception is so.  Plutarch says\u2019 that he\nsees the Latin tongue by the things: \u2018tis here the same: the sense\nilluminates and produces the words, no more words of air, but of flesh\nand bone; they signify more than they say.  Moreover, those who are not\nwell skilled in a language present some image of this; for in Italy I\nsaid whatever I had a mind to in common discourse, but in more serious\ntalk, I durst not have trusted myself with an idiom that I could not wind\nand turn out of its ordinary pace; I would have a power of introducing\nsomething of my own.\n\nThe handling and utterance of fine wits is that which sets off language;\nnot so much by innovating it, as by putting it to more vigorous and\nvarious services, and by straining, bending, and adapting it to them.\nThey do not create words, but they enrich their own, and give them weight\nand signification by the uses they put them to, and teach them unwonted\nmotions, but withal ingeniously and discreetly.  And how little this\ntalent is given to all is manifest by the many French scribblers of this\nage: they are bold and proud enough not to follow the common road, but\nwant of invention and discretion ruins them; there is nothing seen in\ntheir writings but a wretched affectation of a strange new style, with\ncold and absurd disguises, which, instead of elevating, depress the\nmatter: provided they can but trick themselves out with new words, they\ncare not what they signify; and to bring in a new word by the head and\nshoulders, they leave the old one, very often more sinewy and significant\nthan the other.\n\nThere is stuff enough in our language, but there is a defect in cutting\nout: for there is nothing that might not be made out of our terms of\nhunting and war, which is a fruitful soil to borrow from; and forms of\nspeaking, like herbs, improve and grow stronger by being transplanted.\nI find it sufficiently abundant, but not sufficiently pliable and\nvigorous; it commonly quails under a powerful conception; if you would\nmaintain the dignity of your style, you will often perceive it to flag\nand languish under you, and there Latin steps in to its relief, as Greek\ndoes to others.  Of some of these words I have just picked out we do not\nso easily discern the energy, by reason that the frequent use of them has\nin some sort abased their beauty, and rendered it common; as in our\nordinary language there are many excellent phrases and metaphors to be\nmet with, of which the beauty is withered by age, and the colour is\nsullied by too common handling; but that nothing lessens the relish to an\nunderstanding man, nor does it derogate from the glory of those ancient\nauthors who, \u2018tis likely, first brought those words into that lustre.\n\nThe sciences treat of things too refinedly, after an artificial, very\ndifferent from the common and natural, way.  My page makes love, and\nunderstands it; but read to him Leo Hebraeus--[Leo the Jew, Ficinus,\nCardinal Bembo, and Mario Equicola all wrote Treatises on Love.]--\nand Ficinus, where they speak of love, its thoughts and actions, he\nunderstands it not.  I do not find in Aristotle most of my ordinary\nmotions; they are there covered and disguised in another robe for the use\nof the schools.  Good speed them! were I of the trade, I would as much\nnaturalise art as they artificialise nature.  Let us let Bembo and\nEquicola alone.\n\nWhen I write, I can very well spare both the company and the remembrance\nof books, lest they should interrupt my progress; and also, in truth, the\nbest authors too much humble and discourage me: I am very much of the\npainter\u2019s mind, who, having represented cocks most wretchedly ill,\ncharged all his boys not to suffer any natural cock to come into his\nshop; and had rather need to give myself a little lustre, of the\ninvention of Antigenides the musician, who, when he was asked to sing or\nplay, took care beforehand that the auditory should, either before or\nafter, be satiated with some other ill musicians.  But I can hardly be\nwithout Plutarch; he is so universal and so full, that upon all\noccasions, and what extravagant subject soever you take in hand, he will\nstill be at your elbow, and hold out to you a liberal and not to be\nexhausted hand of riches and embellishments.  It vexes me that he is so\nexposed to be the spoil of those who are conversant with him: I can\nscarce cast an eye upon him but I purloin either a leg or a wing.\n\nAnd also for this design of mine \u2018tis convenient for me for me to write\nat home, in a wild country, where I have nobody to assist or relieve me;\nwhere I hardly see a man who understands the Latin of his Paternoster,\nand of French a little less.  I might have made it better elsewhere, but\nthen the work would have been less my own; and its principal end and\nperfection is to be exactly mine.  I readily correct an accidental error,\nof which I am full, as I run carelessly on; but for my ordinary and\nconstant imperfections, it were a kind of treason to put them out.  When\nanother tells me, or that I say to myself, \u201cThou art too thick of\nfigures: this is a word of rough Gascon: that is a dangerous phrase (I do\nnot reject any of those that are used in the common streets of France;\nthey who would fight custom with grammar are triflers): this is an\nignorant discourse: this is a paradoxical discourse: that is going too\nfar: thou makest thyself too merry at times: men will think thou sayest a\nthing in good earnest which thou only speakest in jest.\u201d--\u201cYes, I know,\nbut I correct the faults of inadvertence, not those of custom.  Do I not\ntalk at the same rate throughout?  Do I not represent myself to the life?\n\u2018Tis enough that I have done what I designed; all the world knows me in\nmy book, and my book in me.\u201d\n\nNow I have an apish, imitative quality: when I used to write verses (and\nI never made any but Latin), they evidently discovered the poet I had\nlast read, and some of my first essays have a little exotic taste: I\nspeak something another kind of language at Paris than I do at Montaigne.\nWhoever I steadfastly look upon easily leaves some impression of his upon\nme; whatever I consider I usurp, whether a foolish countenance, a\ndisagreeable look, or a ridiculous way of speaking; and vices most of\nall, because they seize and stick to me, and will not leave hold without\nshaking.  I swear more by imitation than by complexion: a murderous\nimitation, like that of the apes so terrible both in stature and\nstrength, that Alexander met with in a certain country of the Indies, and\nwhich he would have had much ado any other way to have subdued; but they\nafforded him the means by that inclination of theirs to imitate whatever\nthey saw done; for by that the hunters were taught to put on shoes in\ntheir sight, and to tie them fast with many knots, and to muffle up their\nheads in caps all composed of running nooses, and to seem to anoint their\neyes with glue; so did those poor beasts employ their imitation to their\nown ruin they glued up their own eyes, haltered and bound themselves.\nThe other faculty of playing the mimic, and ingeniously acting the words\nand gestures of another, purposely to make people merry and to raise\ntheir admiration, is no more in me than in a stock.  When I swear my own\noath, \u2018tis only, by God! of all oaths the most direct.  They say that\nSocrates swore by the dog; Zeno had for his oath the same interjection at\nthis time in use amongst the Italians, Cappari!  Pythagoras swore By\nwater and air.  I am so apt, without thinking of it, to receive these\nsuperficial impressions, that if I have Majesty or Highness in my mouth\nthree days together, they come out instead of Excellency and Lordship\neight days after; and what I say to-day in sport and fooling I shall say\nthe same to-morrow seriously.  Wherefore, in writing, I more unwillingly\nundertake beaten arguments, lest I should handle them at another\u2019s\nexpense.  Every subject is equally fertile to me: a fly will serve the\npurpose, and \u2018tis well if this I have in hand has not been undertaken at\nthe recommendation of as flighty a will.  I may begin, with that which\npleases me best, for the subjects are all linked to one another.\n\nBut my soul displeases me, in that it ordinarily produces its deepest and\nmost airy conceits and which please me best, when I least expect or study\nfor them, and which suddenly vanish, having at the instant, nothing to\napply them to; on horseback, at table, and in bed: but most on horseback,\nwhere I am most given to think.  My speaking is a little nicely jealous\nof silence and attention: if I am talking my best, whoever interrupts me,\nstops me.  In travelling, the necessity of the way will often put a stop\nto discourse; besides which I, for the most part, travel without company\nfit for regular discourses, by which means I have all the leisure I would\nto entertain myself.  It falls out as it does in my dreams; whilst\ndreaming I recommend them to my memory (for I am apt to dream that I\ndream), but, the next morning, I may represent to myself of what\ncomplexion they were, whether gay, or sad, or strange, but what they\nwere, as to the rest, the more I endeavour to retrieve them, the deeper I\nplunge them in oblivion.  So of thoughts that come accidentally into my\nhead, I have no more but a vain image remaining in my memory; only enough\nto make me torment myself in their quest to no purpose.\n\nWell, then, laying books aside, and more simply and materially speaking,\nI find, after all, that Love is nothing else but the thirst of enjoying\nthe object desired, or Venus any other thing than the pleasure of\ndischarging one\u2019s vessels, just as the pleasure nature gives in\ndischarging other parts, that either by immoderation or indiscretion\nbecome vicious.  According to Socrates, love is the appetite of\ngeneration by the mediation of beauty.  And when I consider the\nridiculous titillation of this pleasure, the absurd, crack-brained, wild\nmotions with which it inspires Zeno and Cratippus, the indiscreet rage,\nthe countenance inflamed with fury and cruelty in the sweetest effects of\nlove, and then that austere air, so grave, severe, ecstatic, in so wanton\nan action; that our delights and our excrements are promiscuously\nshuffled together; and that the supreme pleasure brings along with it, as\nin pain, fainting and complaining; I believe it to be true, as Plato\nsays, that the gods made man for their sport:\n\n                        \u201cQuaenam ista jocandi\n                         Saevitia!\u201d\n\n     [\u201cWith a sportive cruelty\u201d (Or:) \u201cWhat an unkindness there is in\n     jesting!\u201d--Claudian in Eutrop. i. 24.]\n\nand that it was in mockery that nature has ordered the most agitative of\nactions and the most common, to make us equal, and to put fools and wise\nmen, beasts and us, on a level.  Even the most contemplative and prudent\nman, when I imagine him in this posture, I hold him an impudent fellow to\npretend to be prudent and contemplative; they are the peacocks\u2019 feet that\nabate his pride:\n\n                         \u201cRidentem dicere verum\n                         Quid vetat?\u201d\n\n          [\u201cWhat prevents us from speaking truth with a smile?\u201d\n           --Horace, Sat., i. I, 24.]\n\nThey who banish serious imaginations from their sports, do, says one,\nlike him who dares not adore the statue of a saint, if not covered with a\nveil.  We eat and drink, indeed, as beasts do; but these are not actions\nthat obstruct the functions of the soul, in these we maintain our\nadvantage over them; this other action subjects all other thought,\nand by its imperious authority makes an ass of all Plato\u2019s divinity and\nphilosophy; and yet there is no complaint of it.  In everything else a\nman may keep some decorum, all other operations submit to the rules of\ndecency; this cannot so much as in imagination appear other than vicious\nor ridiculous: find out, if you can, therein any serious and discreet\nprocedure.  Alexander said, that he chiefly knew himself to be mortal by\nthis act and sleeping; sleep suffocates and suppresses the faculties of\nthe soul; the familiarity with women likewise dissipates and exhausts\nthem: doubtless \u2018tis a mark, not only of our original corruption, but\nalso of our vanity and deformity.\n\nOn the one side, nature pushes us on to it, having fixed the most noble,\nuseful, and pleasant of all her functions to this desire: and, on the\nother side, leaves us to accuse and avoid it, as insolent and indecent,\nto blush at it, and to recommend abstinence.  Are we not brutes to call\nthat work brutish which begets us?  People of so many differing religions\nhave concurred in several proprieties, as sacrifices, lamps, burning\nincense, fasts, and offerings; and amongst others, in the condemning this\nact: all opinions tend that way, besides the widespread custom of\ncircumcision, which may be regarded as a punishment.  We have,\nperadventure, reason to blame ourselves for being guilty of so foolish\na production as man, and to call the act, and the parts that are employed\nin the act, shameful (mine, truly, are now shameful and pitiful).  The\nEssenians, of whom Pliny speaks, kept up their country for several ages\nwithout either nurse or baby-clouts, by the arrival of strangers who,\nfollowing this pretty humour, came continually to them: a whole nation\nbeing resolute, rather to hazard a total extermination, than to engage\nthemselves in female embraces, and rather to lose the succession of men,\nthan to beget one.  \u2018Tis said, that Zeno never had to do with a woman but\nonce in his life, and then out of civility, that he might not seem too\nobstinately to disdain the sex.\n\n     [Diogenes Laertius, vii. 13.--What is there said, however, is that\n     Zeno seldom had commerce with boys, lest he should be deemed a very\n     misogynist.]\n\nEvery one avoids seeing a man born, every one runs to see him die; to\ndestroy him a spacious field is sought out in the face of the sun, but,\nto make him, we creep into as dark and private a corner as we can: \u2018tis a\nman\u2019s duty to withdraw himself bashfully from the light to create; but\n\u2018tis glory and the fountain of many virtues to know how to destroy what\nwe have made: the one is injury, the other favour: for Aristotle says\nthat to do any one a kindness, in a certain phrase of his country, is to\nkill him.  The Athenians, to couple the disgrace of these two actions,\nhaving to purge the Isle of Delos, and to justify themselves to Apollo,\ninterdicted at once all births and burials in the precincts thereof:\n\n                         \u201cNostri nosmet paenitet.\u201d\n\n          [\u201cWe are ashamed of ourselves.\u201d--Terence, Phoymio, i. 3, 20.]\n\nThere are some nations that will not be seen to eat.  I know a lady, and\nof the best quality, who has the same opinion, that chewing disfigures\nthe face, and takes away much from the ladies\u2019 grace and beauty; and\ntherefore unwillingly appears at a public table with an appetite; and I\nknow a man also, who cannot endure to see another eat, nor himself to be\nseen eating, and who is more shy of company when putting in than when\nputting out.  In the Turkish empire, there are a great number of men who,\nto excel others, never suffer themselves to be seen when they make their\nrepast: who never have any more than one a week; who cut and mangle their\nfaces and limbs; who never speak to any one: fanatic people who think to\nhonour their nature by disnaturing themselves; who value themselves upon\ntheir contempt of themselves, and purport to grow better by being worse.\nWhat monstrous animal is this, that is a horror to himself, to whom his\ndelights are grievous, and who weds himself to misfortune?

Not only many\nsects, but many peoples, curse their birth, and bless their death; and\nthere is a place where the sun is abominated and darkness adored.  We are\nonly ingenious in using ourselves ill: \u2018tis the real quarry our\nintellects fly at; and intellect, when misapplied, is a dangerous tool!\n\n               \u201cO miseri! quorum gaudia crimen habent!\u201d\n\n          [\u201cO wretched men, whose pleasures are a crime!\u201d\n           --Pseudo Gallus, i. 180.]\n\nAlas, poor man!  thou hast enough inconveniences that are inevitable,\nwithout increasing them by throe own invention; and art miserable enough\nby nature, without being so by art; thou hast real and essential\ndeformities enough, without forging those that are imaginary.  Dost thou\nthink thou art too much at ease unless half thy ease is uneasy?  dost\nthou find that thou hast not performed all the necessary offices that\nnature has enjoined thee, and that she is idle in thee, if thou dost not\noblige thyself to other and new offices?  Thou dost not stick to infringe\nher universal and undoubted laws; but stickest to thy own special and\nfantastic rules, and by how much more particular, uncertain, and\ncontradictory they are, by so much thou employest thy whole endeavour in\nthem: the laws of thy parish occupy and bind thee: those of God and the\nworld concern thee not.  Run but a little over the examples of this kind;\nthy life is full of them.\n\nWhilst the verses of these two poets, treat so reservedly and discreetly\nof wantonness as they do, methinks they discover it much more openly.\nLadies cover their necks with network, priests cover several sacred\nthings, and painters shadow their pictures to give them greater lustre:\nand \u2018tis said that the sun and wind strike more violently by reflection\nthan in a direct line.  The Egyptian wisely answered him who asked him\nwhat he had under his cloak, \u201cIt is hid under my cloak,\u201d said he, \u201cthat\nthou mayest not know what it is:\u201d but there are certain other things that\npeople hide only to show them.  Hear that one, who speaks plainer,\n\n               \u201cEt nudum pressi corpus ad usque meum:\u201d\n\n          [\u201cAnd pressed her naked body to mine\u201d (Or:) \u201cMy body\n          I applied even to her naked side\u201d--Ovid, Amor., i. 5, 24.]\n\nmethinks that he emasculates me.  Let Martial turn up Venus as high as he\nmay, he cannot shew her so naked: he who says all that is to be said\ngluts and disgusts us.  He who is afraid to express himself, draws us on\nto guess at more than is meant; there is treachery in this sort of\nmodesty, and specially when they half open, as these do, so fair a path\nto imagination.  Both the action and description should relish of theft.\n\nThe more respectful, more timorous, more coy, and secret love of the\nSpaniards and Italians pleases me.  I know not who of old wished his\nthroat as long as that of a crane, that he might the longer taste what he\nswallowed; it had been better wished as to this quick and precipitous\npleasure, especially in such natures as mine that have the fault of being\ntoo prompt.  To stay its flight and delay it with preambles: all things\n--a glance, a bow, a word, a sign, stand for favour and recompense betwixt\nthem.  Were it not an excellent piece of thrift in him who could dine on\nthe steam of the roast?  \u2018Tis a passion that mixes with very little solid\nessence, far more vanity and feverish raving; and we should serve and pay\nit accordingly.  Let us teach the ladies to set a better value and esteem\nupon themselves, to amuse and fool us: we give the last charge at the\nfirst onset; the French impetuosity will still show itself; by spinning\nout their favours, and exposing them in small parcels, even miserable old\nage itself will find some little share of reward, according to its worth\nand merit.  He who has no fruition but in fruition, who wins nothing\nunless he sweeps the stakes, who takes no pleasure in the chase but in\nthe quarry, ought not to introduce himself in our school: the more steps\nand degrees there are, so much higher and more honourable is the\nuppermost seat: we should take a pleasure in being conducted to it, as in\nmagnificent palaces, by various porticoes and passages, long and pleasant\ngalleries, and many windings.  This disposition of things would turn to\nour advantage; we should there longer stay and longer love; without hope\nand without desire we proceed not worth a pin.  Our conquest and entire\npossession is what they ought infinitely to dread: when they wholly\nsurrender themselves up to the mercy of our fidelity and constancy they\nrun a mighty hazard; they are virtues very rare and hard to be found; the\nladies are no sooner ours, than we are no more theirs:\n\n              \u201cPostquam cupidae mentis satiata libido est,\n               Verba nihil metuere, nihil perjuria curant;\u201d\n\n          [\u201cWhen our desires are once satisfied, we care little\n          for oaths and promises.\u201d--Catullus, lxiv.  147.]\n\nAnd Thrasonides, a young man of Greece, was so in love with his passion\nthat, having, gained a mistress\u2019s consent, he refused to enjoy her, that\nhe might not by fruition quench and stupefy the unquiet ardour of which\nhe was so proud, and with which he so fed himself.  Dearness is a good\nsauce to meat: do but observe how much the manner of salutation,\nparticular to our nation, has, by its facilities, made kisses, which\nSocrates says are so powerful and dangerous for the stealing of hearts,\nof no esteem.  It is a displeasing custom and injurious for the ladies,\nthat they must be obliged to lend their lips to every fellow who has\nthree footmen at his heels, however ill-favoured he may be in himself:\n\n                   \u201cCujus livida naribus caninis\n                    Dependet glacies, rigetque barba .  .  .\n                    Centum occurrere malo culilingis:\u201d\n                     Martial, vii. 94.\n\nand we ourselves barely gain by it; for as the world is divided, for\nthree beautiful women we must kiss fifty ugly ones; and to a tender\nstomach, like those of my age, an ill kiss overpays a good one.\n\nIn Italy they passionately court even their common women who sell\nthemselves for money, and justify the doing so by saying, \u201cthat there are\ndegrees of fruition, and that by such service they would procure for\nthemselves that which is most entire; the women sell nothing but their\nbodies; the will is too free and too much of its own to be exposed to\nsale.\u201d  So that these say, \u2018tis the will they undertake and they have\nreason.  \u2018Tis indeed the will that we are to serve and gain by wooing.\nI abhor to imagine mine, a body without affection: and this madness is,\nmethinks, cousin-german to that of the boy who would needs pollute the\nbeautiful statue of Venus made by Praxiteles; or that of the furious\nEgyptian, who violated the dead carcase of a woman he was embalming:\nwhich was the occasion of the law then made in Egypt, that the corpses of\nbeautiful young women, of those of good quality, should be kept three\ndays before they should be delivered to those whose office it was to take\ncare for the interment.  Periander did more wonderfully, who extended his\nconjugal affection (more regular and legitimate) to the enjoyment of his\nwife Melissa after she was dead.  Does it not seem a lunatic humour in\nthe Moon, seeing she could no otherwise enjoy her darling Endymion, to\nlay-him for several months asleep, and to please herself with the\nfruition of a boy who stirred not but in his sleep?  I likewise say that\nwe love a body without a soul or sentiment when we love a body without\nits consent and desire.  All enjoyments are not alike: there are some\nthat are hectic and languishing: a thousand other causes besides\ngood-will may procure us this favour from the ladies; this is not a\nsufficient testimony of affection: treachery may lurk there, as well as\nelsewhere: they sometimes go to\u2019t by halves:\n\n              \u201cTanquam thura merumque parent\n               Absentem marmoreamve putes:\u201d\n\n     [\u201cAs if they are preparing frankincense and wine .  .  . you might\n     think her absent or marble.\u201d--Martial, xi. 103, 12, and 59, 8.]\n\nI know some who had rather lend that than their coach, and who only\nimpart themselves that way.  You are to examine whether your company\npleases them upon any other account, or, as some strong-chined groom,\nfor that only; in what degree of favour and esteem you are with them:\n\n                              \u201cTibi si datur uni,\n                    Quem lapide illa diem candidiore notat.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cWherefore that is enough, if that day alone is given us which she\n     marks with a whiter stone.\u201d--Catullus, lxviii. 147.]\n\nWhat if they eat your bread with the sauce of a more pleasing\nimagination.\n\n               \u201cTe tenet, absentes alios suspirat amores.\u201d\n\n               [\u201cShe has you in her arms; her thoughts are with\n               other absent lovers.\u201d--Tibullus, i. 6, 35.]\n\nWhat? have we not seen one in these days of ours who made use of this act\nfor the purpose of a most horrid revenge, by that means to kill and\npoison, as he did, a worthy lady?\n\nSuch as know Italy will not think it strange if, for this subject, I seek\nnot elsewhere for examples; for that nation may be called the regent of\nthe world in this.  They have more generally handsome and fewer ugly\nwomen than we; but for rare and excellent beauties we have as many as\nthey.  I think the same of their intellects: of those of the common sort,\nthey have evidently far more brutishness is immeasurably rarer there;\nbut in individual characters of the highest form, we are nothing indebted\nto them.  If I should carry on the comparison, I might say, as touching\nvalour, that, on the contrary, it is, to what it is with them, common and\nnatural with us; but sometimes we see them possessed of it to such a\ndegree as surpasses the greatest examples we can produce: The marriages\nof that country are defective in this; their custom commonly imposes so\nrude and so slavish a law upon the women, that the most distant\nacquaintance with a stranger is as capital an offence as the most\nintimate; so that all approaches being rendered necessarily substantial,\nand seeing that all comes to one account, they have no hard choice to\nmake; and when they have broken down the fence, we may safely presume\nthey get on fire:\n\n          \u201cLuxuria ipsis vinculis, sicut fera bestia,\n          irritata, deinde emissa.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cLust, like a wild beast, being more excited by being bound,\n     breaks from his chains with greater wildness.\u201d--Livy, xxxiv. 4.]\n\nThey must give them a little more rein:\n\n         \u201cVidi ego nuper equum, contra sua frena tenacem,\n          Ore reluctanti fulminis ire modo\u201d:\n\n     [\u201cI saw, the other day, a horse struggling against his bit,\n     rush like a thunderbolt.\u201d--Ovid, Amor., iii. 4, 13.]\n\nthe desire of company is allayed by giving it a little liberty.  We are\npretty much in the same case they are extreme in constraint, we in\nlicence.  \u2018Tis a good custom we have in France that our sons are received\ninto the best families, there to be entertained and bred up pages, as in\na school of nobility; and \u2018tis looked upon as a discourtesy and an\naffront to refuse this to a gentleman.  I have taken notice (for, so many\nfamilies, so many differing forms) that the ladies who have been\nstrictest with their maids have had no better luck than those who allowed\nthem a greater liberty.  There should be moderation in these things; one\nmust leave a great deal of their conduct to their own discretion; for,\nwhen all comes to all, no discipline can curb them throughout.  But it is\ntrue withal that she who comes off with flying colours from a school of\nliberty, brings with her whereon to repose more confidence than she who\ncomes away sound from a severe and strict school.\n\nOur fathers dressed up their daughters\u2019 looks in bashfulness and fear\n(their courage and desires being the same); we ours in confidence and\nassurance; we understand nothing of the matter; we must leave it to the\nSarmatian women, who may not lie with a man till with their own hands\nthey have first killed another in battle.  For me, who have no other\ntitle left me to these things but by the ears, \u2018tis sufficient if,\naccording to the privilege of my age, they retain me for one of their\ncounsel. I advise them then, and us men too, to abstinence; but if the\nage we live in will not endure it, at least modesty and discretion.  For,\nas in the story of Aristippus, who, speaking to some young men who\nblushed to see him go into a scandalous house, said \u201cthe vice is in not\ncoming out, not in going in,\u201d let her who has no care of her conscience\nhave yet some regard to her reputation; and though she be rotten within,\nlet her carry a fair outside at least.\n\nI commend a gradation and delay in bestowing their favours: Plato\n\u2018declares that, in all sorts of love, facility and promptness are\nforbidden to the defendant.  \u2018Tis a sign of eagerness which they\nought to disguise with all the art they have, so rashly, wholly, and\nhand-over-hand to surrender themselves.  In carrying themselves orderly\nand measuredly in the granting their last favours, they much more allure\nour desires and hide their own.  Let them still fly before us, even those\nwho have most mind to be overtaken: they better conquer us by flying, as\nthe Scythians did.  To say the truth, according to the law that nature\nhas imposed upon them, it is not properly for them either to will or\ndesire; their part is to suffer, obey, and consent and for this it is\nthat nature has given them a perpetual capacity, which in us is but at\ntimes and uncertain; they are always fit for the encounter, that they may\nbe always ready when we are so \u201cPati natee.\u201d-[\u201cBorn to suffer.\u201d-Seneca,\nEp., 95.]--And whereas she has ordered that our appetites shall be\nmanifest by a prominent demonstration, she would have theirs to be hidden\nand concealed within, and has furnished them with parts improper for\nostentation, and simply defensive.  Such proceedings as this that follows\nmust be left to the Amazonian licence: Alexander marching his army\nthrough Hyrcania, Thalestris, Queen of the Amazons, came with three\nhundred light horse of her own-sex, well mounted, and armed, having left\nthe remainder of a very great, army that followed her behind the\nneighbouring mountains to give him a visit; where she publicly and in\nplain terms told him that the fame of his valour and victories had\nbrought her thither to see him, and to make him an offer of her forces to\nassist him in the pursuit of his enterprises; and that, finding him so\nhandsome, young, and vigorous, she, who was also perfect in all those\nqualities, advised that they might lie together, to the end that from the\nmost valiant woman of the world and the bravest man then living, there\nmight spring some great and wonderful issue for the time to come.\nAlexander returned her thanks for all the rest; but, to give leisure for\nthe accomplishment of her last demand, he detained her thirteen days in\nthat place, which were spent in royal feasting and jollity, for the\nwelcome of so courageous a princess.\n\nWe are, almost throughout, unjust judges of their actions, as they are of\nours.  I confess the truth when it makes against me, as well as when \u2018tis\non my side.  \u2018Tis an abominable intemperance that pushes them on so often\nto change, and that will not let them limit their affection to any one\nperson whatever; as is evident in that goddess to whom are attributed so\nmany changes and so many lovers.  But \u2018tis true withal that \u2018tis contrary\nto the nature of love if it be, not violent; and contrary to the nature\nof violence if it be constant.  And they who wonder, exclaim, and keep\nsuch a clutter to find out the causes of this frailty of theirs, as\nunnatural and not to be believed, how comes it to pass they do not\ndiscern how often they are themselves guilty of the same, without any\nastonishment or miracle at all?  It would, peradventure, be more strange\nto see the passion fixed; \u2018tis not a simply corporeal passion.  If there\nbe no end to avarice and ambition, there is doubtless no more in desire;\nit still lives after satiety; and \u2018tis impossible to prescribe either\nconstant satisfaction or end; it ever goes beyond its possession.  And by\nthat means inconstancy, peradventure, is in some sort more pardonable in\nthem than in us: they may plead, as well as we, the inclination to\nvariety and novelty common to us both; and secondly, without us, that\nthey buy a cat in a sack: Joanna, queen of Naples, caused her first\nhusband, Andrews, to be hanged at the bars of her window in a halter of\ngold and silk woven with her own hand, because in matrimonial\nperformances she neither found his parts nor abilities answer the\nexpectation she had conceived from his stature, beauty, youth, and\nactivity, by which she had been caught and deceived.  They may say there\nis more pains required in doing than in suffering; and so they are on\ntheir part always at least provided for necessity, whereas on our part it\nmay fall out otherwise.  For this reason it was, that Plato wisely made a\nlaw that before marriage, to determine of the fitness of persons, the\njudges should see the young men who pretended to it stripped stark naked,\nand the women but to the girdle only.  When they come to try us they do\nnot, perhaps, find us worthy of their choice:\n\n              \u201cExperta latus, madidoque simillima loro\n               Inguina, nec lassa stare coacta manu,\n               Deserit imbelles thalamos.\u201d\n\n          [\u201cAfter using every endeavour to arouse him to action,\n          she quits the barren couch.\u201d--Martial, vii. 58.]\n\n\u2018Tis not enough that a man\u2019s will be good; weakness and insufficiency\nlawfully break a marriage,\n\n               \u201cEt quaerendum aliunde foret nervosius illud,\n               Quod posset zonam solvere virgineam:\u201d\n\n     [\u201cAnd seeks a more vigorous lover to undo her virgin zone.\u201d\n      --Catullus, lxvii. 27.]\n\nwhy not?  and according to her own standard, an amorous intelligence,\nmore licentious and active,\n\n               \u201cSi blando nequeat superesse labori.\u201d\n\n          [\u201cIf his strength be unequal to the pleasant task.\u201d\n           --Virgil, Georg., iii. 127.]\n\nBut is it not great impudence to offer our imperfections and\nimbecilities, where we desire to please and leave a good opinion and\nesteem of ourselves?  For the little that I am able to do now:\n\n                                   \u201cAd unum\n                         Mollis opus.\u201d\n\n          [\u201cFit but for once.\u201d--Horace, Epod., xii. 15.]\n\nI would not trouble a woman, that I am to reverence and fear:\n\n                              \u201cFuge suspicari,\n                    Cujus undenum trepidavit aetas\n                              Claudere lustrum.\u201d\n\n          [\u201cFear not him whose eleventh lustrum is closed.\u201d\n           --Horace, Od., ii. 4, 12, limits it to the eighth.]\n\nNature should satisfy herself in having rendered this age miserable,\nwithout rendering it ridiculous too.  I hate to see it, for one poor inch\nof pitiful vigour which comes upon it but thrice a week, to strut and set\nitself out with as much eagerness as if it could do mighty feats; a true\nflame of flax; and laugh to see it so boil and bubble and then in a\nmoment so congealed and extinguished. This appetite ought to appertain\nonly to the flower of beautiful youth: trust not to its seconding that\nindefatigable, full, constant, magnanimous ardour you think in you, for\nit will certainly leave you in a pretty corner; but rather transfer it to\nsome tender, bashful, and ignorant boy, who yet trembles at the rod, and\nblushes:\n\n              \u201cIndum sanguineo veluti violaverit ostro\n               Si quis ebur, vel mista rubent ubi lilia multa\n               Alba rosa.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cAs Indian ivory streaked with crimson, or white lilies mixed\n     with the damask rose.\u201d--AEneid, xii. 67.]\n\nWho can stay till the morning without dying for shame to behold the\ndisdain of the fair eyes of her who knows so well his fumbling\nimpertinence,\n\n               \u201cEt taciti fecere tamen convicia vultus,\u201d\n\n          [\u201cThough she nothing say, her looks betray her anger.\u201d\n           --Ovid, Amor., i. 7, 21.]\n\nhas never had the satisfaction and the glory of having cudgelled them\ntill they were weary, with the vigorous performance of one heroic night.\nWhen I have observed any one to be vexed with me, I have not presently\naccused her levity, but have been in doubt, if I had not reason rather to\ncomplain of nature; she has doubtless used me very uncivilly and\nunkindly:\n\n         \u201cSi non longa satis, si non bene mentula crassa\n          Nimirum sapiunt, videntque parvam\n          Matronae quoque mentulam illibenter:\u201d\n\n     [The first of these verses is the commencement of an epigram of the\n     Veterum Poetayurra Catalecta, and the two others are from an epigram\n     in the same collection (Ad Matrones).  They describe untranslatably\n     Montaigne\u2019s charge against nature, indicated in the previous\n     passage.]\n\nand done me a most enormous injury.  Every member I have, as much one as\nanother, is equally my own, and no other more properly makes me a man\nthan this.\n\nI universally owe my entire picture to the public.  The wisdom of my\ninstruction consists in liberty, in truth, in essence: disdaining to\nintroduce those little, feigned, common, and provincial rules into the\ncatalogue of its real duties; all natural, general, and constant,\nof which civility and ceremony are daughters indeed, but illegitimate.\nWe are sure to have the vices of appearance, when we shall have had those\nof essence: when we have done with these, we run full drive upon the\nothers, if we find it must be so; for there is danger that we shall fancy\nnew offices, to excuse our negligence towards the natural ones, and to\nconfound them: and to manifest this, is it not seen that in places where\nfaults are crimes, crimes are but faults; that in nations where the laws\nof decency are most rare and most remiss, the primitive laws of common\nreason are better observed: the innumerable multitude of so many duties\nstifling and dissipating our care.  The application of ourselves to light\nand trivial things diverts us from those that are necessary and just.\nOh, how these superficial men take an easy and plausible way in\ncomparison of ours!  These are shadows wherewith we palliate and pay one\nanother; but we do not pay, but inflame the reckoning towards that great\njudge, who tucks up our rags and tatters above our shameful parts, and\nsuckles not to view us all over, even to our inmost and most secret\nordures: it were a useful decency of our maidenly modesty, could it keep\nhim from this discovery.  In fine, whoever could reclaim man from so\nscrupulous a verbal superstition, would do the world no great disservice.\nOur life is divided betwixt folly and prudence: whoever will write of it\nbut what is reverend and canonical, will leave above the one-half behind.\nI do not excuse myself to myself; and if I did, it should rather be for\nmy excuses that I would excuse myself than for any other fault; I excuse\nmyself of certain humours, which I think more strong in number than those\nthat are on my side.  In consideration of which, I will further say this\n(for I desire to please every one, though it will be hard to do):\n\n          \u201cEsse unum hominem accommodatum ad tantam morum\n          ac sermonum et voluntatum varietatem,\u201d\n\n     [\u201cFor a man to conform to such a variety of manners,\n     discourses, and will.\u201d--Q. Cicero, De Pet. Consul, c. 14.]\n\nthat they ought not to condemn me for what I make authorities, received\nand approved by so many ages, to utter: and that there is no reason that\nfor want of rhyme they should refuse me the liberty they allow even to\nchurchmen of our nation and time, and these amongst the most notable, of\nwhich here are two of their brisk verses:\n\n          \u201cRimula, dispeream, ni monogramma tua est.\u201d\n\n          \u201cUn vit d\u2019amy la contente et bien traicte:\u201d\n\n     [St. Gelais, (Euvres Poetiques), p. 99, ed. of Lyons, 1574.]\n\nbesides how many others.  I love modesty; and \u2018tis not out of judgment\nthat I have chosen this scandalous way of speaking; \u2018tis nature that has\nchosen it for me.  I commend it not, no more than other forms that are\ncontrary to common use: but I excuse it, and by circumstances both\ngeneral and particular, alleviate its accusation.\n\nBut to proceed.  Whence, too, can proceed that usurpation of sovereign\nauthority you take upon you over the women, who favour you at their own\nexpense,\n\n               \u201cSi furtiva dedit mira munuscula nocte,\u201d\n\n     [\u201cIf, in the stealthy night, she has made strange gifts.\u201d\n      --Catullus, lxviii. 145.]\n\nso that you presently assume the interest, coldness, and authority of a\nhusband?  \u2018Tis a free contract why do you not then keep to it, as you\nwould have them do?  there is no prescription upon voluntary things.\n\u2018Tis against the form, but it is true withal, that I in my time have\nconducted this bargain as much as the nature of it would permit, as\nconscientiously and with as much colour of justice, as any other\ncontract; and that I never pretended other affection than what I really\nhad, and have truly acquainted them with its birth, vigour, and\ndeclination, its fits and intermissions: a man does not always hold on\nat the same rate.  I have been so sparing of my promises, that I think\nI have been better than my word.  They have found me faithful even to\nservice of their inconstancy, a confessed and sometimes multiplied\ninconstancy.  I never broke with them, whilst I had any hold at all, and\nwhat occasion soever they have given me, never broke with them to hatred\nor contempt; for such privacies, though obtained upon never so scandalous\nterms, do yet oblige to some good will: I have sometimes, upon their\ntricks and evasions, discovered a little indiscreet anger and impatience;\nfor I am naturally subject to rash emotions, which, though light and\nshort, often spoil my market.  At any time they have consulted my\njudgment, I never stuck to give them sharp and paternal counsels, and to\npinch them to the quick.  If I have left them any cause to complain of\nme, \u2018tis rather to have found in me, in comparison of the modern use, a\nlove foolishly conscientious than anything else.  I have kept my, word in\nthings wherein I might easily have been dispensed; they sometimes\nsurrendered themselves with reputation, and upon articles that they were\nwilling enough should be broken by the conqueror: I have, more than once,\nmade pleasure in its greatest effort strike to the interest of their\nhonour; and where reason importuned me, have armed them against myself;\nso that they ordered themselves more decorously and securely by my rules,\nwhen they frankly referred themselves to them, than they would have done\nby their own.  I have ever, as much as I could, wholly taken upon myself\nalone the hazard of our assignations, to acquit them; and have always\ncontrived our meetings after the hardest and most unusual manner, as less\nsuspected, and, moreover, in my opinion, more accessible.  They are\nchiefly more open, where they think they are most securely shut; things\nleast feared are least interdicted and observed; one may more boldly dare\nwhat nobody thinks you dare, which by its difficulty becomes easy.  Never\nhad any man his approaches more impertinently generative; this way of\nloving is more according to discipline but how ridiculous it is to our\npeople, and how ineffectual, who better knows than I? yet I shall not\nrepent me of it; I have nothing there more to lose:\n\n                        \u201cMe tabula sacer\n                         Votiva paries, indicat uvida\n                         Suspendisse potenti\n                         Vestimenta maris deo:\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThe holy wall, by my votive table, shows that I have hanged up my\n     wet clothes in honour of the powerful god of the sea.\u201d\n      --Horace, Od., i.  5, 13.]\n\n\u2018tis now time to speak out.  But as I might, per adventure, say to\nanother, \u201cThou talkest idly, my friend; the love of thy time has little\ncommerce with faith and integrity;\u201d\n\n              \u201cHaec si tu postules\n               Ratione certa facere, nihilo plus agas,\n               Quam si des operam, ut cum ratione insanias:\u201d\n\n     [\u201cIf you seek to make these things certain by reason, you will do no\n     more than if you should seek to be mad in your senses.\u201d\n      --Terence, Eun., act i., sc.  i, v. 16.]\n\non the contrary, also, if it were for me to begin again, certainly it\nshould be by the same method and the same progress, how fruitless soever\nit might be to me; folly and insufficiency are commendable in an\nincommendable action: the farther I go from their humour in this, I\napproach so much nearer to my own.  As to the rest, in this traffic, I\ndid not suffer myself to be totally carried away; I pleased myself in it,\nbut did not forget myself.  I retained the little sense and discretion\nthat nature has given me, entire for their service and my own: a little\nemotion, but no dotage.  My conscience, also, was engaged in it, even to\ndebauch and licentiousness; but, as to ingratitude, treachery, malice,\nand cruelty, never.  I would not purchase the pleasure of this vice at\nany price, but content myself with its proper and simple cost:\n\n                    \u201cNullum intra se vitium est.\u201d\n\n          [\u201cNothing is a vice in itself.\u201d--Seneca, Ep., 95.]\n\nI almost equally hate a stupid and slothful laziness, as I do a toilsome\nand painful employment; this pinches, the other lays me asleep.  I like\nwounds as well as bruises, and cuts as well as dry blows.  I found in\nthis commerce, when I was the most able for it, a just moderation betwixt\nthese extremes.  Love is a sprightly, lively, and gay agitation; I was\nneither troubled nor afflicted with it, but heated, and moreover,\ndisordered; a man must stop there; it hurts nobody but fools.  A young\nman asked the philosopher Panetius if it were becoming a wise man to be\nin love?  \u201cLet the wise man look to that,\u201d answered he, \u201cbut let not thou\nand I, who are not so, engage ourselves in so stirring and violent an\naffair, that enslaves us to others, and renders us contemptible to\nourselves.\u201d  He said true that we are not to intrust a thing so\nprecipitous in itself to a soul that has not wherewithal to withstand its\nassaults and disprove practically the saying of Agesilaus, that prudence\nand love cannot live together.  \u2018Tis a vain employment, \u2018tis true,\nunbecoming, shameful, and illegitimate; but carried on after this manner,\nI look upon it as wholesome, and proper to enliven a drowsy soul and to\nrouse up a heavy body; and, as an experienced physician, I would\nprescribe it to a man of my form and condition, as soon as any other\nrecipe whatever, to rouse and keep him in vigour till well advanced in\nyears, and to defer the approaches of age.  Whilst we are but in the\nsuburbs, and that the pulse yet beats:\n\n         \u201cDum nova canities, dum prima et recta senectus,\n          Dum superest lachesi quod torqueat, et pedibus me\n          Porto meis, nullo dextram subeunte bacillo,\u201d\n\n     [\u201cWhilst the white hair is new, whilst old age is still straight\n     shouldered, whilst there still remains something for Lachesis to\n     spin, whilst I walk on my own legs, and need no staff to lean upon.\u201d\n      --Juvenal, iii. 26.]\n\nwe have need to be solicited and tickled by some such nipping incitation\nas this.  Do but observe what youth, vigour, and gaiety it inspired the\ngood Anacreon withal: and Socrates, who was then older than I, speaking\nof an amorous object:\n\n\u201cLeaning,\u201d said he, \u201cmy shoulder to her shoulder, and my head to hers, as\nwe were reading together in a book, I felt, without dissembling, a sudden\nsting in my shoulder like the biting of an insect, which I still felt\nabove five days after, and a continual itching crept into my heart.\u201d  So\nthat merely the accidental touch, and of a shoulder, heated and altered a\nsoul cooled and enerved by age, and the strictest liver of all mankind.\nAnd, pray, why not?  Socrates was a man, and would neither be, nor seem,\nany other thing.  Philosophy does not contend against natural pleasures,\nprovided they be moderate, and only preaches moderation, not a total\nabstinence; the power of its resistance is employed against those that\nare adulterate and strange.  Philosophy says that the appetites of the\nbody ought not to be augmented by the mind, and ingeniously warns us not\nto stir up hunger by saturity; not to stuff, instead of merely filling,\nthe belly; to avoid all enjoyments that may bring us to want; and all\nmeats and drinks that bring thirst and hunger: as, in the service of\nlove, she prescribes us to take such an object as may simply satisfy the\nbody\u2019s need, and does not stir the soul, which ought only barely to\nfollow and assist the body, without mixing in the affair.  But have I not\nreason to hold that these precepts, which, indeed, in my opinion, are\nsomewhat over strict, only concern a body in its best plight; and that in\na body broken with age, as in a weak stomach, \u2018tis excusable to warm and\nsupport it by art, and by the mediation of the fancy to restore the\nappetite and cheerfulness it has lost of itself.\n\nMay we not say that there is nothing in us, during this earthly prison,\nthat is purely either corporeal or spiritual; and that we injuriously\nbreak up a man alive; and that it seems but reasonable that we should\ncarry ourselves as favourably, at least, towards the use of pleasure as\nwe do towards that of pain!  Pain was (for example) vehement even to\nperfection in the souls of the saints by penitence: the body had there\nnaturally a sham by the right of union, and yet might have but little\npart in the cause; and yet are they not contented that it should barely\nfollow and assist the afflicted soul: they have afflicted itself with\ngrievous and special torments, to the end that by emulation of one\nanother the soul and body might plunge man into misery by so much more\nsalutiferous as it is more severe.  In like manner, is it not injustice,\nin bodily pleasures, to subdue and keep under the soul, and say that it\nmust therein be dragged along as to some enforced and servile obligation\nand necessity?  \u2018Tis rather her part to hatch and cherish them, there to\npresent herself, and to invite them, the authority of ruling belonging to\nher; as it is also her part, in my opinion, in pleasures that are proper\nto her, to inspire and infuse into the body all the sentiment it is\ncapable of, and to study how to make them sweet and useful to it.  For it\nis good reason, as they say, that the body should not pursue its\nappetites to the prejudice of the mind; but why is it not also the reason\nthat the mind should not pursue hers to the prejudice of the body?\n\nI have no other passion to keep me in breath.  What avarice, ambition,\nquarrels, lawsuits do for others who, like me, have no particular\nvocation, love would much more commodiously do; it would restore to me\nvigilance, sobriety, grace, and the care of my person; it would reassure\nmy countenance, so that the grimaces of old age, those deformed and\ndismal looks, might not come to disgrace it; would again put me upon\nsound and wise studies, by which I might render myself more loved and\nesteemed, clearing my mind of the despair of itself and of its use, and\nredintegrating it to itself; would divert me from a thousand troublesome\nthoughts, a thousand melancholic humours that idleness and the ill\nposture of our health loads us withal at such an age; would warm again,\nin dreams at least, the blood that nature is abandoning; would hold up\nthe chin, and a little stretch out the nerves, the vigour and gaiety of\nlife of that poor man who is going full drive towards his ruin.  But I\nvery well understand that it is a commodity hard to recover: by weakness\nand long experience our taste is become more delicate and nice; we ask\nmost when we bring least, and are harder to choose when we least deserve\nto be accepted: and knowing ourselves for what we are, we are less\nconfident and more distrustful; nothing can assure us of being beloved,\nconsidering our condition and theirs.  I am out of countenance to see\nmyself in company with those young wanton creatures:\n\n              \u201cCujus in indomito constantior inguine nervus,\n               Quam nova collibus arbor inhaeret.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cIn whose unbridled reins the vigour is more inherent than in the\n     young tree on the hills.\u201d--Horace, Epod., xii. 19.]\n\nTo what end should we go insinuate our misery amid their gay and\nsprightly humour?\n\n                   \u201cPossint ut juvenes visere fervidi.\n                    Multo non sine risu,\n                    Dilapsam in cineres facem.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cAs the fervid youths may behold, not without laughter, a burning\n     torch worn to ashes.\u201d--Horace, Od., iv.  13, 21.]\n\nThey have strength and reason on their side; let us give way; we have\nnothing to do there: and these blossoms of springing beauty suffer not\nthemselves to be handled by such benumbed hands nor dealt with by mere\nmaterial means, for, as the old philosopher answered one who jeered him\nbecause he could not gain the favour of a young girl he made love to:\n\u201cFriend, the hook will not stick in such soft cheese.\u201d  It is a commerce\nthat requires relation and correspondence: the other pleasures we receive\nmay be acknowledged by recompenses of another nature, but this is not to\nbe paid but with the same kind of coin.  In earnest, in this sport, the\npleasure I give more tickles my imagination than that they give me; now,\nhe has nothing of generosity in him who can receive pleasure where he\nconfers none--it must needs be a mean soul that will owe all, and can be\ncontent to maintain relations with persons to whom he is a continual\ncharge; there is no beauty, grace, nor privacy so exquisite that a\ngentleman ought to desire at this rate.  If they can only be kind to us\nout of pity, I had much rather die than live upon charity.  I would have\nright to ask, in the style wherein I heard them beg in Italy: \u201cFate ben\nper voi,\u201d--[\u201cDo good for yourself.\u201d]--or after the manner that Cyrus\nexhorted his soldiers, \u201cWho loves himself let him follow me.\u201d--\u201cConsort\nyourself,\u201d some one will say to me, \u201cwith women of your own condition,\nwhom like fortune will render more easy to your desire.\u201d  O ridiculous\nand insipid composition!\n\n                                   \u201cNolo\n                    Barbam vellere mortuo leoni.\u201d\n\n          [\u201cI would not pluck the beard from a dead lion.\u201d--Martial]\n\nXenophon lays it for an objection and an accusation against Menon, that\nhe never made love to any but old women.  For my part, I take more\npleasure in but seeing the just and sweet mixture of two young beauties,\nor only in meditating on it in my fancy, than myself in acting second in\na pitiful and imperfect conjunction;\n\n     [Which Cotton renders, \u201cThan to be myself an actor in the second\n     with a deformed creature.\u201d]\n\nI leave that fantastic appetite to the Emperor Galba, who was only for\nold curried flesh: and to this poor wretch:\n\n              \u201cO ego Di faciant talem to cernere possim,\n               Caraque mutatis oscula ferre comis,\n               Amplectique meis corpus non pingue lacertis!\u201d\n\n     [Ovid, who (Ex.

Cotton has \u201cEmonez, a young courtezan of Chios.\u201d]\n\nUgliness of a confessed antiquity is to me less old and less ugly than\nanother that is polished and plastered up.  Shall I speak it, without the\ndanger of having my throat cut? love, in my opinion, is not properly and\nnaturally in its season, but in the age next to childhood,\n\n                   \u201cQuem si puellarum insereres choro,\n                    Mille sagaces falleret hospites,\n                    Discrimen obscurum, solutis\n                    Crinibus ambiguoque vultu:\u201d\n\n     [\u201cWhom if thou shouldst place in a company of girls, it would\n     require a thousand experts to distinguish him, with his loose locks\n     and ambiguous countenance.\u201d--Horace, Od., ii. 5, 21.]\n\nnor beauty neither; for whereas Homer extends it so far as to the budding\nof the beard, Plato himself has remarked this as rare: and the reason why\nthe sophist Bion so pleasantly called the first appearing hairs of\nadolescence \u2018Aristogitons\u2019 and \u2018Harmodiuses\u2019--[Plutarch, On Love, c.34.]--\nis sufficiently known.  I find it in virility already in some sort a\nlittle out of date, though not so much as in old age;\n\n                   \u201cImportunus enim transvolat aridas\n                    Quercus.\u201d\n\n               [\u201cFor it uncivilly passes over withered oaks.\u201d\n                --Horace, Od., iv. 13, 9.]\n\nand Marguerite, Queen of Navarre, like a woman, very far extends the\nadvantage of women, ordaining that it is time, at thirty years old, to\nconvert the title of fair into that of good.  The shorter authority we\ngive to love over our lives, \u2018tis so much the better for us.  Do but\nobserve his port; \u2018tis a beardless boy.  Who knows not how, in his school\nthey proceed contrary to all order; study, exercise, and usage are their\nways for insufficiency there novices rule:\n\n                         \u201cAmor ordinem nescit.\u201d\n\n          [\u201cLove ignores rules.\u201d (Or:) \u201cLove knows no rule.\u201d\n           --St. Jerome, Letter to Chyomatius.]\n\nDoubtless his conduct is much more graceful when mixed with inadvertency\nand trouble; miscarriages and ill successes give him point and grace;\nprovided it be sharp and eager, \u2018tis no great matter whether it be\nprudent or no: do but observe how he goes reeling, tripping, and playing:\nyou put him in the stocks when you guide him by art and wisdom; and he is\nrestrained of his divine liberty when put into those hairy and callous\nclutches.\n\nAs to the rest, I often hear the women set out this intelligence as\nentirely spiritual, and disdain to put the interest the senses there have\ninto consideration; everything there serves; but I can say that I have\noften seen that we have excused the weakness of their understandings in\nfavour of their outward beauty, but have never yet seen that in favour of\nmind, how mature and full soever, any of them would hold out a hand to a\nbody that was never so little in decadence.  Why does not some one of\nthem take it into her head to make that noble Socratical bargain between\nbody and soul, purchasing a philosophical and spiritual intelligence and\ngeneration at the price of her thighs, which is the highest price she can\nget for them?  Plato ordains in his Laws that he who has performed any\nsignal and advantageous exploit in war may not be refused during the\nwhole expedition, his age or ugliness notwithstanding, a kiss or any\nother amorous favour from any woman whatever.  What he thinks to be so\njust in recommendation of military valour, why may it not be the same in\nrecommendation of any other good quality? and why does not some woman\ntake a fancy to possess over her companions the glory of this chaste\nlove?  I may well say chaste;\n\n                    \u201cNam si quando ad praelia ventum est,\n               Ut quondam in stipulis magnus sine viribus ignis,\n               Incassum furit:\u201d\n\n     [\u201cFor when they sometimes engage in love\u2019s battle,\n     his sterile ardour lights up but as the flame of a straw.\u201d\n      --Virgil, Georg., iii.  98.]\n\nthe vices that are stifled in the thought are not the worst.\n\nTo conclude this notable commentary, which has escaped from me in a\ntorrent of babble, a torrent sometimes impetuous and hurtful,\n\n              \u201cUt missum sponsi furtivo munere malum\n               Procurrit casto virginis a gremio,\n               Quod miserae oblitae molli sub veste locatuat,\n               Dum adventu matris prosilit, excutitur,\n               Atque illud prono praeceps agitur decursu\n               Huic manat tristi conscius ore rubor.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cAs when an apple, sent by a lover secretly to his mistress, falls\n     from the chaste virgin\u2019s bosom, where she had quite forgotten it;\n     when, starting at her mother\u2019s coming in, it is shaken out and rolls\n     over the floor before her eyes, a conscious blush covers her face.\u201d\n      --Catullus, lxv. 19.]\n\nI say that males and females are cast in the same mould, and that,\neducation and usage excepted, the difference is not great.

Of Coaches.\nVII.      Of the Inconvenience of Greatness.\nVIII.     Of the Art of Conference.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nOF COACHES\n\nIt is very easy to verify, that great authors, when they write of causes,\nnot only make use of those they think to be the true causes, but also of\nthose they believe not to be so, provided they have in them some beauty\nand invention: they speak true and usefully enough, if it be ingeniously.\nWe cannot make ourselves sure of the supreme cause, and therefore crowd a\ngreat many together, to see if it may not accidentally be amongst them:\n\n               \u201cNamque unam dicere causam\n          Non satis est, verum plures, unde una tamen sit.\u201d\n\n     [Lucretius, vi. 704.--The sense is in the preceding passage.]\n\nDo you ask me, whence comes the custom of blessing those who sneeze?\nWe break wind three several ways; that which sallies from below is too\nfilthy; that which breaks out from the mouth carries with it some\nreproach of gluttony; the third is sneezing, which, because it proceeds\nfrom the head and is without offence, we give it this civil reception: do\nnot laugh at this distinction; they say \u2018tis Aristotle\u2019s.\n\nI think I have seen in Plutarch\u2019 (who of all the authors I know, is he\nwho has best mixed art with nature, and judgment with knowledge), his\ngiving as a reason for the, rising of the stomach in those who are at\nsea, that it is occasioned by fear; having first found out some reason by\nwhich he proves that fear may produce such an effect.  I, who am very\nsubject to it, know well that this cause concerns not me; and I know it,\nnot by argument, but by necessary experience.  Without instancing what\nhas been told me, that the same thing often happens in beasts, especially\nhogs, who are out of all apprehension of danger; and what an acquaintance\nof mine told me of himself, that though very subject to it, the\ndisposition to vomit has three or four times gone off him, being very\nafraid in a violent storm, as it happened to that ancient:\n\n          \u201cPejus vexabar, quam ut periculum mihi succurreret;\u201d\n\n          [\u201cI was too ill to think of danger.\u201d (Or the reverse:)\n          \u201cI was too frightened to be ill.\u201d--Seneca, Ep., 53. 2]\n\nI was never afraid upon the water, nor indeed in any other peril (and I\nhave had enough before my eyes that would have sufficed, if death be\none), so as to be astounded to lose my judgment.  Fear springs sometimes\nas much from want of judgment as from want of courage.  All the dangers I\nhave been in I have looked upon without winking, with an open, sound, and\nentire sight; and, indeed, a man must have courage to fear.  It formerly\nserved me better than other help, so to order and regulate my retreat,\nthat it was, if not without fear, nevertheless without affright and\nastonishment; it was agitated, indeed, but not amazed or stupefied.\nGreat souls go yet much farther, and present to us flights, not only\nsteady and temperate, but moreover lofty.  Let us make a relation of that\nwhich Alcibiades reports of Socrates, his fellow in arms: \u201cI found him,\u201d\n says he, \u201cafter the rout of our army, him and Lachez, last among those\nwho fled, and considered him at my leisure and in security, for I was\nmounted on a good horse, and he on foot, as he had fought.  I took\nnotice, in the first place, how much judgment and resolution he showed,\nin comparison of Lachez, and then the bravery of his march, nothing\ndifferent from his ordinary gait; his sight firm and regular, considering\nand judging what passed about him, looking one while upon those, and then\nupon others, friends and enemies, after such a manner as encouraged\nthose, and signified to the others that he would sell his life dear to\nany one who should attempt to take it from him, and so they came off; for\npeople are not willing to attack such kind of men, but pursue those they\nsee are in a fright.\u201d  That is the testimony of this great captain, which\nteaches us, what we every day experience, that nothing so much throws us\ninto dangers as an inconsiderate eagerness of getting ourselves clear of\nthem:\n\n     \u201cQuo timoris minus est, eo minus ferme periculi est.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cWhen there is least fear, there is for the most part least\n     danger.\u201d--Livy, xxii. 5.]\n\nOur people are to blame who say that such an one is afraid of death, when\nthey would express that he thinks of it and foresees it: foresight is\nequally convenient in what concerns us, whether good or ill.  To consider\nand judge of danger is, in some sort, the reverse to being astounded.\nI do not find myself strong enough to sustain the force and impetuosity\nof this passion of fear, nor of any other vehement passion whatever: if I\nwas once conquered and beaten down by it, I should never rise again very\nsound.  Whoever should once make my soul lose her footing, would never\nset her upright again: she retastes and researches herself too\nprofoundly, and too much to the quick, and therefore would never let the\nwound she had received heal and cicatrise.  It has been well for me that\nno sickness has yet discomposed her: at every charge made upon me, I\npreserve my utmost opposition and defence; by which means the first that\nshould rout me would keep me from ever rallying again.  I have no\nafter-game to play: on which side soever the inundation breaks my banks,\nI lie open, and am drowned without remedy.  Epicurus says, that a wise\nman can never become a fool; I have an opinion reverse to this sentence,\nwhich is, that he who has once been a very fool, will never after be very\nwise. God grants me cold according to my cloth, and passions\nproportionable to the means I have to withstand them: nature having laid\nme open on the one side, has covered me on the other; having disarmed me\nof strength, she has armed me with insensibility and an apprehension that\nis regular, or, if you will, dull.\n\nI cannot now long endure (and when I was young could much less) either\ncoach, litter, or boat, and hate all other riding but on horseback, both\nin town and country.  But I can bear a litter worse than a coach; and, by\nthe same reason, a rough agitation upon the water, whence fear is\nproduced, better than the motions of a calm.  At the little jerks of\noars, stealing the vessel from under us, I find, I know not how, both my\nhead and my stomach disordered; neither-can I endure to sit upon a\ntottering chair.  When the sail or the current carries us equally, or\nthat we are towed, the equal agitation does not disturb me at all; \u2018tis\nan interrupted motion that offends me, and most of all when most slow: I\ncannot otherwise express it.  The physicians have ordered me to squeeze\nand gird myself about the bottom of the belly with a napkin to remedy\nthis evil; which however I have not tried, being accustomed to wrestle\nwith my own defects, and overcome them myself.\n\nWould my memory serve me, I should not think my time ill spent in setting\ndown here the infinite variety that history presents us of the use of\nchariots in the service of war: various, according to the nations and\naccording to the age; in my opinion, of great necessity and effect; so\nthat it is a wonder that we have lost all knowledge of them.  I will only\nsay this, that very lately, in our fathers\u2019 time, the Hungarians made\nvery advantageous use of them against the Turks; having in every one of\nthem a targetter and a musketeer, and a number of harquebuses piled ready\nand loaded, and all covered with a pavesade like a galliot--[Canvas\nspread along the side of a ship of war, in action to screen the movements\nof those on board.]--They formed the front of their battle with three\nthousand such coaches, and after the cannon had played, made them all\npour in their shot upon the enemy, who had to swallow that volley before\nthey tasted of the rest, which was no little advance; and that done,\nthese chariots charged into their squadrons to break them and open a way\nfor the rest; besides the use they might make of them to flank the\nsoldiers in a place of danger when marching to the field, or to cover a\npost, and fortify it in haste.  In my time, a gentleman on one of our\nfrontiers, unwieldy of body, and finding no horse able to carry his\nweight, having a quarrel, rode through the country in a chariot of this\nfashion, and found great convenience in it.  But let us leave these\nchariots of war.\n\nAs if their effeminacy--[Which Cotton translates: \u201cas if the\ninsignificancy of coaches.\u201d ]--had not been sufficiently known by better\nproofs, the last kings of our first race travelled in a chariot drawn by\nfour oxen.  Marc Antony was the first at Rome who caused himself to be\ndrawn in a coach by lions, and a singing wench with him.\n\n     [Cytheris, the Roman courtezan.--Plutarch\u2019s Life of Antony, c. 3.\n     This, was the same person who is introduced by Gallus under the name\n     of Lycoris.  Gallus doubtless knew her personally.]\n\nHeliogabalus did since as much, calling himself Cybele, the mother of the\ngods; and also drawn by tigers, taking upon him the person of the god\nBacchus; he also sometimes harnessed two stags to his coach, another time\nfour dogs, and another four naked wenches, causing himself to be drawn by\nthem in pomp, stark naked too.  The Emperor Firmus caused his chariot to\nbe drawn by ostriches of a prodigious size, so that it seemed rather to\nfly than roll.\n\nThe strangeness of these inventions puts this other fancy in my head:\nthat it is a kind of pusillanimity in monarchs, and a testimony that they\ndo not sufficiently understand themselves what they are, when they study\nto make themselves honoured and to appear great by excessive expense: it\nwere indeed excusable in a foreign country, but amongst their own\nsubjects, where they are in sovereign command, and may do what they\nplease, it derogates from their dignity the most supreme degree of honour\nto which they can arrive: just as, methinks, it is superfluous in a\nprivate gentleman to go finely dressed at home; his house, his\nattendants, and his kitchen sufficiently answer for him.  The advice that\nIsocrates gives his king seems to be grounded upon reason: that he should\nbe splendid in plate and furniture; forasmuch as it is an expense of\nduration that devolves on his successors; and that he should avoid all\nmagnificences that will in a short time be forgotten.  I loved to go fine\nwhen I was a younger brother, for want of other ornament; and it became\nme well: there are some upon whom their rich clothes weep: We have\nstrange stories of the frugality of our kings about their own persons and\nin their gifts: kings who were great in reputation, valour, and fortune.\nDemosthenes vehemently opposes the law of his city that assigned the\npublic money for the pomp of their public plays and festivals: he would\nthat their greatness should be seen in numbers of ships well equipped,\nand good armies well provided for; and there is good reason to condemn\nTheophrastus, who, in his Book on Riches, establishes a contrary opinion,\nand maintains that sort of expense to be the true fruit of abundance.\nThey are delights, says Aristotle, that a only please the baser sort of\nthe people, and that vanish from the memory as soon as the people are\nsated with them, and for which no serious and judicious man can have any\nesteem.  This money would, in my opinion, be much more royally, as more\nprofitably, justly, and durably, laid out in ports, havens, walls, and\nfortifications; in sumptuous buildings, churches, hospitals, colleges,\nthe reforming of streets and highways: wherein Pope Gregory XIII.  will\nleave a laudable memory to future times: and wherein our Queen Catherine\nwould to long posterity manifest her natural liberality and munificence,\ndid her means supply her affection.  Fortune has done me a great despite\nin interrupting the noble structure of the Pont-Neuf of our great city,\nand depriving me of the hope of seeing it finished before I die.\n\nMoreover, it seems to subjects, who are spectators of these triumphs,\nthat their own riches are exposed before them, and that they are\nentertained at their own expense: for the people are apt to presume of\nkings, as we do of our servants, that they are to take care to provide us\nall things necessary in abundance, but not touch it themselves; and\ntherefore the Emperor Galba, being pleased with a musician who played to\nhim at supper, called for his money-box, and gave him a handful of crowns\nthat he took out of it, with these words: \u201cThis is not the public money,\nbut my own.\u201d  Yet it so falls out that the people, for the most part,\nhave reason on their side, and that the princes feed their eyes with what\nthey have need of to fill their bellies.\n\nLiberality itself is not in its true lustre in a sovereign hand: private\nmen have therein the most right; for, to take it exactly, a king has\nnothing properly his own; he owes himself to others: authority is not\ngiven in favour of the magistrate, but of the people; a superior is never\nmade so for his own profit, but for the profit of the inferior, and a\nphysician for the sick person, and not for himself: all magistracy, as\nwell as all art, has its end out of itself wherefore the tutors of young\nprinces, who make it their business to imprint in them this virtue of\nliberality, and preach to them to deny nothing and to think nothing so\nwell spent as what they give (a doctrine that I have known in great\ncredit in my time), either have more particular regard to their own\nprofit than to that of their master, or ill understand to whom they\nspeak.  It is too easy a thing to inculcate liberality on him who has as\nmuch as he will to practise it with at the expense of others; and, the\nestimate not being proportioned to the measure of the gift but to the\nmeasure of the means of him who gives it, it comes to nothing in so\nmighty hands; they find themselves prodigal before they can be reputed\nliberal.  And it is but a little recommendation, in comparison with other\nroyal virtues: and the only one, as the tyrant Dionysius said, that suits\nwell with tyranny itself.  I should rather teach him this verse of the\nancient labourer:\n\n     [\u201cThat whoever will have a good crop must sow with his hand, and not\n     pour out of the sack.\u201d--Plutarch, Apothegms,  Whether the Ancients\n     were more excellent in Arms than in Learning.]\n\nhe must scatter it abroad, and not lay it on a heap in one place: and\nthat, seeing he is to give, or, to say better, to pay and restore to so\nmany people according as they have deserved, he ought to be a loyal and\ndiscreet disposer.  If the liberality of a prince be without measure or\ndiscretion, I had rather he were covetous.\n\nRoyal virtue seems most to consist in justice; and of all the parts of\njustice that best denotes a king which accompanies liberality, for this\nthey have particularly reserved to be performed by themselves, whereas\nall other sorts of justice they remit to the administration of others.\nAn immoderate bounty is a very weak means to acquire for them good will;\nit checks more people than it allures:\n\n          \u201cQuo in plures usus sis, minus in multos uti possis....\n          Quid autem est stultius, quam, quod libenter facias,\n          curare ut id diutius facere non possis;\u201d\n\n     [\u201cBy how much more you use it to many, by so much less will you be\n     in a capacity to use it to many more.  And what greater folly can\n     there be than to order it so that what you would willingly do, you\n     cannot do longer.\u201d--Cicero, De Offic., ii. 15.]\n\nand if it be conferred without due respect of merit, it puts him out of\ncountenance who receives it, and is received ungraciously.  Tyrants have\nbeen sacrificed to the hatred of the people by the hands of those very\nmen they have unjustly advanced; such kind of men as buffoons, panders,\nfiddlers, and such ragamuffins, thinking to assure to themselves the\npossession of benefits unduly received, if they manifest to have him in\nhatred and disdain of whom they hold them, and in this associate\nthemselves to the common judgment and opinion.\n\nThe subjects of a prince excessive in gifts grow excessive in asking,\nand regulate their demands, not by reason, but by example.  We have,\nseriously, very often reason to blush at our own impudence: we are\nover-paid, according to justice, when the recompense equals our service;\nfor do we owe nothing of natural obligation to our princes?  If he bear\nour charges, he does too much; \u2018tis enough that he contribute to them:\nthe overplus is called benefit, which cannot be exacted: for the very\nname Liberality sounds of Liberty.\n\nIn our fashion it is never done; we never reckon what we have received;\nwe are only for the future liberality; wherefore, the more a prince\nexhausts himself in giving, the poorer he grows in friends.  How should\nhe satisfy immoderate desires, that still increase as they are fulfilled?\nHe who has his thoughts upon taking, never thinks of what he has taken;\ncovetousness has nothing so properly and so much its own as ingratitude.\n\nThe example of Cyrus will not do amiss in this place, to serve the kings\nof these times for a touchstone to know whether their gifts are well or\nill bestowed, and to see how much better that emperor conferred them than\nthey do, by which means they are reduced to borrow of unknown subjects,\nand rather of them whom they have wronged than of them on whom they have\nconferred their benefits, and so receive aids wherein there is nothing of\ngratuitous but the name.  Croesus reproached him with his bounty, and\ncast up to how much his treasure would amount if he had been a little\ncloser-handed.  He had a mind to justify his liberality, and therefore\nsent despatches into all parts to the grandees of his dominions whom he\nhad particularly advanced, entreating every one of them to supply him\nwith as much money as they could, for a pressing occasion, and to send\nhim particulars of what each could advance.  When all these answers were\nbrought to him, every one of his friends, not thinking it enough barely\nto offer him so much as he had received from his bounty, and adding to it\na great deal of his own, it appeared that the sum amounted to a great\ndeal more than Croesus\u2019 reckoning.  Whereupon Cyrus: \u201cI am not,\u201d said he,\n\u201cless in love with riches than other princes, but rather a better\nhusband; you see with how small a venture I have acquired the inestimable\ntreasure of so many friends, and how much more faithful treasurers they\nare to me than mercenary men without obligation, without affection; and\nmy money better laid up than in chests, bringing upon me the hatred,\nenvy, and contempt of other princes.\u201d\n\nThe emperors excused the superfluity of their plays and public spectacles\nby reason that their authority in some sort (at least in outward\nappearance) depended upon the will of the people of Rome, who, time out\nof mind, had been accustomed to be entertained and caressed with such\nshows and excesses.  But they were private citizens, who had nourished\nthis custom to gratify their fellow-citizens and companions (and chiefly\nout of their own purses) by such profusion and magnificence it had quite\nanother taste when the masters came to imitate it:\n\n          \u201cPecuniarum translatio a justis dominis ad alienos\n          non debet liberalis videri.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThe transferring of money from the right owners to strangers\n     ought not to have the title of liberality.\u201d\n      --Cicero, De Offic., i. 14.]\n\nPhilip, seeing that his son went about by presents to gain the affection\nof the Macedonians, reprimanded him in a letter after this manner: \u201cWhat!\nhast thou a mind that thy subjects shall look upon thee as their\ncash-keeper and not as their king?  Wilt thou tamper with them to win\ntheir affections?  Do it, then, by the benefits of thy virtue, and not by\nthose of thy chest.\u201d  And yet it was, doubtless, a fine thing to bring\nand plant within the amphitheatre a great number of vast trees, with all\ntheir branches in their full verdure, representing a great shady forest,\ndisposed in excellent order; and, the first day, to throw into it a\nthousand ostriches and a thousand stags, a thousand boars, and a thousand\nfallow-deer, to be killed and disposed of by the people: the next day, to\ncause a hundred great lions, a hundred leopards, and three hundred bears\nto be killed in his presence; and for the third day, to make three\nhundred pair of gladiators fight it out to the last, as the Emperor\nProbus did.  It was also very fine to see those vast amphitheatres, all\nfaced with marble without, curiously wrought with figures and statues,\nand within glittering with rare enrichments:\n\n               \u201cBaltheus en! gemmis, en illita porticus auro:\u201d\n\n     [\u201cA belt glittering with jewels, and a portico overlaid with gold.\u201d\n      --Calpurnius, Eclog., vii. 47.  A baltheus was a shoulder-belt or\n     baldric.]\n\nall the sides of this vast space filled and environed, from the bottom to\nthe top, with three or four score rows of seats, all of marble also, and\ncovered with cushions:\n\n                         \u201cExeat, inquit,\n                    Si pudor est, et de pulvino surgat equestri,\n                    Cujus res legi non sufficit;\u201d\n\n     [\u201cLet him go out, he said, if he has any sense of shame, and rise\n     from the equestrian cushion, whose estate does not satisfy the law.\u201d\n      --Juvenal, iii. 153.

Nor yet of sylvan marvels alone had\n     we sight: I saw sea-calves fight with bears, and a deformed sort of\n     cattle, we might call sea-horses.\u201d--Calpurnius, Eclog., vii. 64.]\n\nSometimes they made a high mountain advance itself, covered with\nfruit-trees and other leafy trees, sending down rivulets of water from\nthe top, as from the mouth of a fountain: otherwhiles, a great ship was\nseen to come rolling in, which opened and divided of itself, and after\nhaving disgorged from the hold four or five hundred beasts for fight,\nclosed again, and vanished without help.  At other times, from the floor\nof this place, they made spouts of perfumed water dart their streams\nupward, and so high as to sprinkle all that infinite multitude.  To\ndefend themselves from the injuries of the weather, they had that vast\nplace one while covered over with purple curtains of needlework, and\nby-and-by with silk of one or another colour, which they drew off or\non in a moment, as they had a mind:\n\n              \u201cQuamvis non modico caleant spectacula sole,\n               Vela reducuntur, cum venit Hermogenes.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThe curtains, though the sun should scorch the spectators, are\n     drawn in, when Hermogenes appears.\u201d-Martial, xii.  29, 15.

It is with this sort of fertility, as with all other\nproducts of nature: not that she there and then employed her utmost\nforce: we do not go; we rather run up and down, and whirl this way and\nthat; we turn back the way we came.  I am afraid our knowledge is weak in\nall senses; we neither see far forward nor far backward; our\nunderstanding comprehends little, and lives but a little while; \u2018tis\nshort both in extent of time and extent of matter:\n\n                   \u201cVixere fortes ante Agamemnona\n                    Mufti, sed omnes illacrymabiles\n                    Urgentur, ignotique longs\n                    Nocte.\u201d\n\n     [ Many brave men lived before Agamemnon, but all are pressed by the\n     long night unmourned and unknown.\u201d--Horace, Od., iv. 9, 25.]\n\n              \u201cEt supra bellum Thebanum et funera Trojae\n               Non alias alii quoque res cecinere poetae?\u201d\n\n     [\u201cWhy before the Theban war and the destruction of Troy, have not\n     other poets sung other events?\u201d--Lucretius, v. 327.  Montaigne here\n     diverts himself m giving Lucretius\u2019 words a construction directly\n     contrary to what they bear in the poem.  Lucretius puts the\n     question, Why if the earth had existed from all eternity, there had\n     not been poets, before the Theban war, to sing men\u2019s exploits.\n     --Coste.]\n\nAnd the narrative of Solon, of what he had learned from the Egyptian\npriests, touching the long life of their state, and their manner of\nlearning and preserving foreign histories, is not, methinks, a testimony\nto be refused in this consideration:\n\n     \u201cSi interminatam in omnes partes magnitudinem regionum videremus et\n     temporum, in quam se injiciens animus et intendens, ita late\n     longeque peregrinatur, ut nullam oram ultimi videat, in qua possit\n     insistere: in haec immensitate .  .  .  infinita vis innumerabilium\n     appareret fomorum.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cCould we see on all parts the unlimited magnitude of regions and\n     of times, upon which the mind being intent, could wander so far and\n     wide, that no limit is to be seen, in which it can bound its eye, we\n     should, in that infinite immensity, discover an infinite force of\n     innumerable atoms.\u201d  Here also Montaigne puts a sense quite\n     different from what the words bear in the original; but the\n     application he makes of them is so happy that one would declare they\n     were actually put together only to express his own sentiments.  \u201cEt\n     temporum\u201d is an addition by Montaigne.--Coste.]\n\nThough all that has arrived, by report, of our knowledge of times past\nshould be true, and known by some one person, it would be less than\nnothing in comparison of what is unknown.  And of this same image of the\nworld, which glides away whilst we live upon it, how wretched and limited\nis the knowledge of the most curious; not only of particular events,\nwhich fortune often renders exemplary and of great concern, but of the\nstate of great governments and nations, a hundred more escape us than\never come to our knowledge.  We make a mighty business of the invention\nof artillery and printing, which other men at the other end of the world,\nin China, had a thousand years ago.  Did we but see as much of the world\nas we do not see, we should perceive, we may well believe, a perpetual\nmultiplication and vicissitude of forms.  There is nothing single and\nrare in respect of nature, but in respect of our knowledge, which is a\nwretched foundation whereon to ground our rules, and that represents to\nus a very false image of things.  As we nowadays vainly conclude the\ndeclension and decrepitude of the world, by the arguments we extract from\nour own weakness and decay:\n\n          \u201cJamque adeo est affecta aetas effoet aque tellus;\u201d\n\n          [\u201cOur age is feeble, and the earth less fertile.\u201d\n           --Lucretius, ii. 1151.]\n\nso did he vainly conclude as to its birth and youth, by the vigour he\nobserved in the wits of his time, abounding in novelties and the\ninvention of divers arts:\n\n         \u201cVerum, ut opinor, habet novitatem summa, recensque\n          Natura est mundi, neque pridem exordia coepit\n          Quare etiam quaedam nunc artes expoliuntur,\n          Nunc etiam augescunt; nunc addita navigiis sunt\n          Multa.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cBut, as I am of opinion, the whole of the world is of recent\n     origin, nor had its commencement in remote times; wherefore it is\n     that some arts are still being refined, and some just on the\n     increase; at present many additions are being made to shipping.\u201d\n      --Lucretius, v. 331.]\n\nOur world has lately discovered another (and who will assure us that it\nis the last of its brothers, since the Daemons, the Sybils, and we\nourselves have been ignorant of this till now?), as large, well-peopled,\nand fruitful as this whereon we live and yet so raw and childish, that we\nare still teaching it it\u2019s a B C: \u2018tis not above fifty years since it\nknew neither letters, weights, measures, vestments, corn, nor vines: it\nwas then quite naked in the mother\u2019s lap, and only lived upon what she\ngave it.  If we rightly conclude of our end, and this poet of the\nyouthfulness of that age of his, that other world will only enter into\nthe light when this of ours shall make its exit; the universe will fall\ninto paralysis; one member will be useless, the other in vigour.  I am\nvery much afraid that we have greatly precipitated its declension and\nruin by our contagion; and that we have sold it opinions and our arts at\na very dear rate.  It was an infant world, and yet we have not whipped\nand subjected it to our discipline by the advantage of our natural worth\nand force, neither have we won it by our justice and goodness, nor\nsubdued it by our magnanimity.  Most of their answers, and the\nnegotiations we have had with them, witness that they were nothing behind\nus in pertinency and clearness of natural understanding.  The astonishing\nmagnificence of the cities of Cusco and Mexico, and, amongst many other\nthings, the garden of the king, where all the trees, fruits, and plants,\naccording to the order and stature they have in a garden, were\nexcellently formed in gold; as, in his cabinet, were all the animals bred\nupon his territory and in its seas; and the beauty of their manufactures,\nin jewels, feathers, cotton, and painting, gave ample proof that they\nwere as little inferior to us in industry.  But as to what concerns\ndevotion, observance of the laws, goodness, liberality, loyalty, and\nplain dealing, it was of use to us that we had not so much as they; for\nthey have lost, sold, and betrayed themselves by this advantage over us.\n\nAs to boldness and courage, stability, constancy against pain, hunger,\nand death, I should not fear to oppose the examples I find amongst them\nto the most famous examples of elder times that we find in our records on\nthis side of the world.  Far as to those who subdued them, take but away\nthe tricks and artifices they practised to gull them, and the just\nastonishment it was to those nations to see so sudden and unexpected an\narrival of men with beards, differing in language, religion, shape, and\ncountenance, from so remote a part of the world, and where they had never\nheard there was any habitation, mounted upon great unknown monsters,\nagainst those who had not only never seen a horse, but had never seen any\nother beast trained up to carry a man or any other loading; shelled in a\nhard and shining skin, with a cutting and glittering weapon in his hand,\nagainst them, who, out of wonder at the brightness of a looking glass or\na knife, would exchange great treasures of gold and pearl; and who had\nneither knowledge, nor matter with which, at leisure, they could\npenetrate our steel: to which may be added the lightning and thunder of\nour cannon and harquebuses, enough to frighten Caesar himself, if\nsurprised, with so little experience, against people naked, except where\nthe invention of a little quilted cotton was in use, without other arms,\nat the most, than bows, stones, staves, and bucklers of wood; people\nsurprised under colour of friendship and good faith, by the curiosity of\nseeing strange and unknown things; take but away, I say, this disparity\nfrom the conquerors, and you take away all the occasion of so many\nvictories.  When I look upon that in vincible ardour wherewith so many\nthousands of men, women, and children so often presented and threw\nthemselves into inevitable dangers for the defence of their gods and\nliberties; that generous obstinacy to suffer all extremities and\ndifficulties, and death itself, rather than submit to the dominion of\nthose by whom they had been so shamefully abused; and some of them\nchoosing to die of hunger and fasting, being prisoners, rather than to\naccept of nourishment from the hands of their so basely victorious\nenemies: I see, that whoever would have attacked them upon equal terms of\narms, experience, and number, would have had a hard, and, peradventure,\na harder game to play than in any other war we have seen.\n\nWhy did not so noble a conquest fall under Alexander, or the ancient\nGreeks and Romans; and so great a revolution and mutation of so many\nempires and nations, fall into hands that would have gently levelled,\nrooted up, and made plain and smooth whatever was rough and savage\namongst them, and that would have cherished and propagated the good seeds\nthat nature had there produced; mixing not only with the culture of land\nand the ornament of cities, the arts of this part of the world, in what\nwas necessary, but also the Greek and Roman virtues, with those that were\noriginal of the country?  What a reparation had it been to them, and what\na general good to the whole world, had our first examples and deportments\nin those parts allured those people to the admiration and imitation of\nvirtue, and had begotten betwixt them and us a fraternal society and\nintelligence?  How easy had it been to have made advantage of souls so\ninnocent, and so eager to learn, leaving, for the most part, naturally so\ngood inclinations before?  Whereas, on the contrary, we have taken\nadvantage of their ignorance and inexperience, with greater ease to\nincline them to treachery, luxury, avarice, and towards all sorts of\ninhumanity and cruelty, by the pattern and example of our manners.  Who\never enhanced the price of merchandise at such a rate?  So many cities\nlevelled with the ground, so many nations exterminated, so many millions\nof people fallen by the edge of the sword, and the richest and most\nbeautiful part of the world turned upside down, for the traffic of pearl\nand pepper?  Mechanic victories!  Never did ambition, never did public\nanimosities, engage men against one another in such miserable\nhostilities, in such miserable calamities.\n\nCertain Spaniards, coasting the sea in quest of their mines, landed in a\nfruitful and pleasant and very well peopled country, and there made to\nthe inhabitants their accustomed professions: \u201cthat they were peaceable\nmen, who were come from a very remote country, and sent on the behalf of\nthe King of Castile, the greatest prince of the habitable world, to whom\nthe Pope, God\u2019s vicegerent upon earth, had given the principality of all\nthe Indies; that if they would become tributaries to him, they should be\nvery gently and courteously used\u201d; at the same time requiring of them\nvictuals for their nourishment, and gold whereof to make some pretended\nmedicine; setting forth, moreover, the belief in one only God, and the\ntruth of our religion, which they advised them to embrace, whereunto they\nalso added some threats.  To which they received this answer: \u201cThat as to\ntheir being peaceable, they did not seem to be such, if they were so.\nAs to their king, since he was fain to beg, he must be necessitous and\npoor; and he who had made him this gift, must be a man who loved\ndissension, to give that to another which was none of his own, to bring\nit into dispute against the ancient possessors.  As to victuals, they\nwould supply them; that of gold they had little; it being a thing they\nhad in very small esteem, as of no use to the service of life, whereas\ntheir only care was to pass it over happily and pleasantly: but that what\nthey could find excepting what was employed in the service of their gods,\nthey might freely take.  As to one only God, the proposition had pleased\nthem well; but that they would not change their religion, both because\nthey had so long and happily lived in it, and that they were not wont to\ntake advice of any but their friends, and those they knew: as to their\nmenaces, it was a sign of want of judgment to threaten those whose nature\nand power were to them unknown; that, therefore, they were to make haste\nto quit their coast, for they were not used to take the civilities and\nprofessions of armed men and strangers in good part; otherwise they\nshould do by them as they had done by those others,\u201d showing them the\nheads of several executed men round the walls of their city.  A fair\nexample of the babble of these children.  But so it is, that the\nSpaniards did not, either in this or in several other places, where they\ndid not find the merchandise they sought, make any stay or attempt,\nwhatever other conveniences were there to be had; witness my CANNIBALS.\n--[Chapter XXX. of Book I.]\n\nOf the two most puissant monarchs of that world, and, peradventure, of\nthis, kings of so many kings, and the last they turned out, he of Peru,\nhaving been taken in a battle, and put to so excessive a ransom as\nexceeds all belief, and it being faithfully paid, and he having, by his\nconversation, given manifest signs of a frank, liberal, and constant\nspirit, and of a clear and settled understanding, the conquerors had a\nmind, after having exacted one million three hundred and twenty-five\nthousand and five hundred weight of gold, besides silver, and other\nthings which amounted to no less (so that their horses were shod with\nmassy gold), still to see, at the price of what disloyalty and injustice\nwhatever, what the remainder of the treasures of this king might be, and\nto possess themselves of that also.  To this end a false accusation was\npreferred against him, and false witnesses brought to prove that he went\nabout to raise an insurrection in his provinces, to procure his own\nliberty; whereupon, by the virtuous sentence of those very men who had by\nthis treachery conspired his ruin, he was condemned to be publicly hanged\nand strangled, after having made him buy off the torment of being burnt\nalive, by the baptism they gave him immediately before execution; a\nhorrid and unheard of barbarity, which, nevertheless, he underwent\nwithout giving way either in word or look, with a truly grave and royal\nbehaviour.  After which, to calm and appease the people, aroused and\nastounded at so strange a thing, they counterfeited great sorrow for his\ndeath, and appointed most sumptuous funerals.\n\nThe other king of Mexico,--[Guatimosin]--having for a long time defended\nhis beleaguered city, and having in this siege manifested the utmost of\nwhat suffering and perseverance can do, if ever prince and people did,\nand his misfortune having delivered him alive into his enemies\u2019 hands,\nupon articles of being treated like a king, neither did he in his\ncaptivity discover anything unworthy of that title.  His enemies, after\ntheir victory, not finding so much gold as they expected, when they had\nsearched and rifled with their utmost diligence, they went about to\nprocure discoveries by the most cruel torments they could invent upon the\nprisoners they had taken: but having profited nothing by these, their\ncourage being greater than their torments, they arrived at last to such a\ndegree of fury, as, contrary to their faith and the law of nations, to\ncondemn the king himself, and one of the principal noblemen of his court,\nto the rack, in the presence of one another.  This lord, finding himself\novercome with pain, being environed with burning coals, pitifully turned\nhis dying eyes towards his master, as it were to ask him pardon that he\nwas able to endure no more; whereupon the king, darting at him a fierce\nand severe look, as reproaching his cowardice and pusillanimity, with a\nharsh and constant voice said to him thus only: \u201cAnd what dost thou think\nI suffer? am I in a bath? am I more at ease than thou?\u201d  Whereupon the\nother immediately quailed under the torment and died upon the spot.  The\nking, half roasted, was carried thence; not so much out of pity (for what\ncompassion ever touched so barbarous souls, who, upon the doubtful\ninformation of some vessel of gold to be made a prey of, caused not only\na man, but a king, so great in fortune and desert, to be broiled before\ntheir eyes), but because his constancy rendered their cruelty still more\nshameful.  They afterwards hanged him for having nobly attempted to\ndeliver himself by arms from so long a captivity and subjection, and he\ndied with a courage becoming so magnanimous a prince.\n\nAnother time, they burnt in the same fire four hundred and sixty men\nalive at once, the four hundred of the common people, the sixty the\nprincipal lords of a province, simply prisoners of war.  We have these\nnarratives from themselves for they not only own it, but boast of it and\npublish it.  Could it be for a testimony of their justice or their zeal\nto religion?  Doubtless these are ways too differing and contrary to so\nholy an end.  Had they proposed to themselves to extend our faith, they\nwould have considered that it does not amplify in the possession of\nterritories, but in the gaining of men; and would have more than\nsatisfied themselves with the slaughters occasioned by the necessity of\nwar, without indifferently mixing a massacre, as upon wild beasts, as\nuniversal as fire and sword could make it; having only, by intention,\nsaved so many as they meant to make miserable slaves of, for the work and\nservice of their mines; so that many of the captains were put to death\nupon the place of conquest, by order of the kings of Castile, justly\noffended with the horror of their deportment, and almost all of them\nhated and disesteemed.  God meritoriously permitted that all this great\nplunder should be swallowed up by the sea in transportation, or in the\ncivil wars wherewith they devoured one another; and most of the men\nthemselves were buried in a foreign land without any fruit of their\nvictory.\n\nThat the revenue from these countries, though in the hands of so\nparsimonious and so prudent a prince,--[Phillip II.]--so little answers\nthe expectation given of it to his predecessors, and to that original\nabundance of riches which was found at the first landing in those new\ndiscovered countries (for though a great deal be fetched thence, yet we\nsee \u2018tis nothing in comparison of that which might be expected), is that\nthe use of coin was there utterly unknown, and that consequently their\ngold was found all hoarded together, being of no other use but for\nornament and show, as a furniture reserved from father to son by many\npuissant kings, who were ever draining their mines to make this vast heap\nof vessels and statues for the decoration of their palaces and temples;\nwhereas our gold is always in motion and traffic; we cut it into a\nthousand small pieces, and cast it into a thousand forms, and scatter and\ndisperse it in a thousand ways.  But suppose our kings should thus hoard\nup all the gold they could get in several ages and let it lie idle by\nthem.\n\nThose of the kingdom of Mexico were in some sort more civilised and more\nadvanced in arts than the other nations about them.  Therefore did they\njudge, as we do, that the world was near its period, and looked upon the\ndesolation we brought amongst them as a certain sign of it.  They\nbelieved that the existence of the world was divided into five ages, and\nin the life of five successive suns, of which four had already ended\ntheir time, and that this which gave them light was the fifth.  The first\nperished, with all other creatures, by an universal inundation of water;\nthe second by the heavens falling upon us and suffocating every living\nthing to which age they assigned the giants, and showed bones to the\nSpaniards, according to the proportion of which the stature of men\namounted to twenty feet; the third by fire, which burned and consumed\nall; the fourth by an emotion of the air and wind, which came with such\nviolence as to beat down even many mountains, wherein the men died not,\nbut were turned into baboons.  What impressions will not the weakness of\nhuman belief admit?  After the death of this fourth sun, the world was\ntwenty-five years in perpetual darkness: in the fifteenth of which a man\nand a woman were created, who restored the human race: ten years after,\nupon a certain day, the sun appeared newly created, and since the account\nof their year takes beginning from that day: the third day after its\ncreation the ancient gods died, and the new ones were since born daily.\nAfter what manner they think this last sun shall perish, my author knows\nnot; but their number of this fourth change agrees with the great\nconjunction of stars which eight hundred and odd years ago, as\nastrologers suppose, produced great alterations and novelties in the\nworld.\n\nAs to pomp and magnificence, upon the account of which I engaged in this\ndiscourse, neither Greece, Rome, nor Egypt, whether for utility,\ndifficulty, or state, can compare any of their works with the highway to\nbe seen in Peru, made by the kings of the country, from the city of Quito\nto that of Cusco (three hundred leagues), straight, even, five-and-twenty\npaces wide, paved, and provided on both sides with high and beautiful\nwalls; and close by them, and all along on the inside, two perennial\nstreams, bordered with beautiful plants, which they call moly.  In this\nwork, where they met with rocks and mountains, they cut them through, and\nmade them even, and filled up pits and valleys with lime and stone to\nmake them level.  At the end of every day\u2019s journey are beautiful\npalaces, furnished with provisions, vestments, and arms, as well for\ntravellers as for the armies that are to pass that way.  In the estimate\nof this work I have reckoned the difficulty which is especially\nconsiderable in that place; they did not build with any stones less than\nten feet square, and had no other conveniency of carriage but by drawing\ntheir load themselves by force of arm, and knew not so much as the art of\nscaffolding, nor any other way of standing to their work, but by throwing\nup earth against the building as it rose higher, taking it away again\nwhen they had done.\n\nLet us here return to our coaches.  Instead of these, and of all other\nsorts of carriages, they caused themselves to be carried upon men\u2019s\nshoulders.  This last king of Peru, the day that he was taken, was thus\ncarried betwixt two upon staves of gold, and set in a chair of gold in\nthe middle of his army.  As many of these sedan-men as were killed to\nmake him fall (for they would take him alive), so many others (and they\ncontended for it) took the place of those who were slain, so that they\ncould never beat him down, what slaughter soever they made of these\npeople, till a horseman, seizing upon him, brought him to the ground.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nOF THE INCONVENIENCE OF GREATNESS\n\nSince we cannot attain unto it, let us revenge our selves by railing at\nit; and yet it is not absolutely railing against anything to proclaim its\ndefects, because they are in all things to be found, how beautiful or how\nmuch to be coveted soever.  Greatness has, in general, this manifest\nadvantage, that it can lower itself when it pleases, and has, very near,\nthe choice of both the one and the other condition; for a man does not\nfall from all heights; there are several from which one may descend\nwithout falling down.  It does, indeed, appear to me that we value it at\ntoo high a rate, and also overvalue the resolution of those whom we have\neither seen or heard have contemned it, or displaced themselves of their\nown accord: its essence is not so evidently commodious that a man may\nnot, with out a miracle, refuse it.  I find it a very hard thing to\nundergo misfortunes, but to be content with a moderate measure of\nfortune, and to avoid greatness, I think a very easy matter.  \u2018Tis,\nmethinks, a virtue to which I, who am no conjuror, could without any\ngreat endeavour arrive.  What, then, is to be expected from them that\nwould yet put into consideration the glory attending this refusal,\nwherein there may lurk worse ambition than even in the desire itself,\nand fruition of greatness?  Forasmuch as ambition never comports itself\nbetter, according to itself, than when it proceeds by obscure and\nunfrequented ways.\n\nI incite my courage to patience, but I rein it as much as I can towards\ndesire.  I have as much to wish for as another, and allow my wishes as\nmuch liberty and indiscretion; but yet it never befell me to wish for\neither empire or royalty, or the eminency of those high and commanding\nfortunes: I do not aim that way; I love myself too well.  When I think to\ngrow greater, \u2018tis but very moderately, and by a compelled and timorous\nadvancement, such as is proper for me in resolution, in prudence, in\nhealth, in beauty, and even in riches too; but this supreme reputation,\nthis mighty authority, oppress my imagination; and, quite contrary to\nthat other,--[Julius Caesar.]--I should, peradventure, rather choose to\nbe the second or third in Perigord than the first at Paris at least,\nwithout lying, rather the third at Paris than the first.  I would neither\ndispute with a porter, a miserable unknown, nor make crowds open in\nadoration as I pass.  I am trained up to a moderate condition, as well by\nmy choice as fortune; and have made it appear, in the whole conduct of my\nlife and enterprises, that I have rather avoided than otherwise the\nclimbing above the degree of fortune wherein God has placed me by my\nbirth; all natural constitution is equally just and easy.  My soul is\nsuch a poltroon, that I measure not good fortune by the height, but by\nthe facility.\n\nBut if my heart be not great enough, \u2018tis open enough to make amends, at\nany one\u2019s request, freely to lay open its weakness.  Should any one put\nme upon comparing the life of L. Thorius Balbus, a brave man, handsome,\nlearned, healthful, understanding, and abounding in all sorts of\nconveniences and pleasures, leading a quiet life, and all his own, his\nmind well prepared against death, superstition, pain, and other\nincumbrances of human necessity, dying, at last, in battle, with his\nsword in his hand, for the defence of his country, on the one part; and\non the other part, the life of M. Regulus, so great and high as is known\nto every one, and his end admirable; the one without name and without\ndignity, the other exemplary and glorious to a wonder.  I should\ndoubtless say, as Cicero did, could I speak as well as he.\n\n     [Cicero, De Finibus, ii. 20, gives the preference to Regulus, and\n     proclaims him the happier man.]\n\nBut if I was to compare them with my own, I should then also say that the\nfirst is as much according to my capacity, and from desire, which I\nconform to my capacity, as the second is far beyond it; that I could not\napproach the last but with veneration, the other I could readily attain\nby use.\n\nLet us return to our temporal greatness, from which we are digressed.  I\ndisrelish all dominion, whether active or passive.  Otanes, one of the\nseven who had right to pretend to the kingdom of Persia, did as I should\nwillingly have done, which was, that he gave up to his competitors his\nright of being promoted to it, either by election or by lot, provided\nthat he and his might live in the empire out of all authority and\nsubjection, those of the ancient laws excepted, and might enjoy all\nliberty that was not prejudicial to these, being as impatient of\ncommanding as of being commanded.\n\nThe most painful and difficult employment in the world, in my opinion, is\nworthily to discharge the office of a king.  I excuse more of their\nmistakes than men commonly do, in consideration of the intolerable weight\nof their function, which astounds me.  \u2018Tis hard to keep measure in so\nimmeasurable a power; yet so it is that it is, even to those who are not\nof the best nature, a singular incitement to virtue to be seated in a\nplace where you cannot do the least good that shall not be put upon\nrecord, and where the least benefit redounds to so many men, and where\nyour talent of administration, like that of preachers, principally\naddresses itself to the people, no very exact judge, easy to deceive, and\neasily content.  There are few things wherein we can give a sincere\njudgment, by reason that there are few wherein we have not, in some sort,\na private interest.  Superiority and inferiority, dominion and subjection\nare bound to a natural envy and contest, and must of necessity\nperpetually intrench upon one another.  I believe neither the one nor the\nother touching the rights of the other party; let reason therefore, which\nis inflexible and without passion, determine when we can avail ourselves\nof it.  \u2018Tis not above a month ago that I read over, two Scottish authors\ncontending upon this subject, of whom he who stands for the people makes\nthe king to be in a worse condition than a carter; he who writes for\nmonarchy places him some degrees above God in power and sovereignty.\n\nNow, the incommodity of greatness that I have taken to remark in this\nplace, upon some occasion that has lately put it into my head, is this:\nthere is not, peradventure, anything more pleasant in the commerce of\nmany than the trials that we make against one another, out of emulation\nof honour and worth, whether in the exercises of the body or in those of\nthe mind, wherein sovereign greatness can have no true part.  And, in\nearnest, I have often thought that by force of respect itself men use\nprinces disdainfully and injuriously in that particular; for the thing I\nwas infinitely offended at in my childhood, that they who exercised with\nme forbore to do their best because they found me unworthy of their\nutmost endeavour, is what we see happen to them daily, every one finding\nhimself unworthy to contend with them.  If we discover that they have the\nleast desire to get the better of us, there is no one who will not make\nit his business to give it them, and who will not rather betray his own\nglory than offend theirs; and will therein employ so much force only as\nis necessary to save their honour.  What share have they, then, in the\nengagement, where every one is on their side?  Methinks I see those\npaladins of ancient times presenting themselves to jousts and battle with\nenchanted arms and bodies.  Brisson,\n\n     [Plutarch, On Satisfaction or Tranquillity of the Mind.  But in his\n     essay, How a Man may Distinguish a Flatterer from a Friend, he calls\n     him Chriso.]\n\nrunning against Alexander, purposely missed his blow, and made a fault in\nhis career; Alexander chid him for it, but he ought to have had him\nwhipped.  Upon this consideration Carneades said, that \u201cthe sons of\nprinces learned nothing right but to manage horses; by reason that, in\nall their other exercises, every one bends and yields to them; but a\nhorse, that is neither a flatterer nor a courtier, throws the son of a\nking with no more ceremony than he would throw that of a porter.\u201d\n\nHomer was fain to consent that Venus, so sweet and delicate a goddess as\nshe was, should be wounded at the battle of Troy, thereby to ascribe\ncourage and boldness to her qualities that cannot possibly be in those\nwho are exempt from danger.  The gods are made to be angry, to fear, to\nrun away, to be jealous, to grieve, to be transported with passions, to\nhonour them with the virtues that, amongst us, are built upon these\nimperfections. Who does not participate in the hazard and difficulty, can\nclaim no interest in the honour and pleasure that are the consequents of\nhazardous actions.  \u2018Tis pity a man should be so potent that all things\nmust give way to him; fortune therein sets you too remote from society,\nand places you in too great a solitude.  This easiness and mean facility\nof making all things bow under you, is an enemy to all sorts of pleasure:\n\u2018tis to slide, not to go; \u2018tis to sleep, and not to live.  Conceive man\naccompanied with omnipotence: you overwhelm him; he must beg disturbance\nand opposition as an alms: his being and his good are in indigence. Evil\nto man is in its turn good, and good evil. Neither is pain always to be\nshunned, nor pleasure always to be pursued.\n\nTheir good qualities are dead and lost; for they can only be perceived by\ncomparison, and we put them out of this: they have little knowledge of\ntrue praise, having their ears deafened with so continual and uniform an\napprobation.  Have they to do with the stupidest of all their subjects?\nthey have no means to take any advantage of him; if he but say: \u201c\u2018Tis\nbecause he is my king,\u201d he thinks he has said enough to express that he\ntherefore suffered himself to be overcome.  This quality stifles and\nconsumes the other true and essential qualities: they are sunk in the\nroyalty, and leave them nothing to recommend themselves with but actions\nthat directly concern and serve the function of their place; \u2018tis so much\nto be a king, that this alone remains to them.  The outer glare that\nenvirons him conceals and shrouds him from us; our sight is there\nrepelled and dissipated, being filled and stopped by this prevailing\nlight.  The senate awarded the prize of eloquence to Tiberius; he refused\nit, esteeming that though it had been just, he could derive no advantage\nfrom a judgment so partial, and that was so little free to judge.\n\nAs we give them all advantages of honour, so do we soothe and authorise\nall their vices and defects, not only by approbation, but by imitation\nalso.  Every one of Alexander\u2019s followers carried his head on one side,\nas he did; and the flatterers of Dionysius ran against one another in his\npresence, and stumbled at and overturned whatever was under foot, to shew\nthey were as purblind as he.  Hernia itself has also served to recommend\na man to favour; I have seen deafness affected; and because the master\nhated his wife, Plutarch--[who, however, only gives one instance; and in\nthis he tells us that the man visited his wife privately.]--has seen his\ncourtiers repudiate theirs, whom they loved; and, which is yet more,\nuncleanliness and all manner of dissoluteness have so been in fashion; as\nalso disloyalty, blasphemy, cruelty, heresy, superstition, irreligion,\neffeminacy, and worse, if worse there be; and by an example yet more\ndangerous than that of Mithridates\u2019 flatterers, who, as their master\npretended to the honour of a good physician, came to him to have\nincisions and cauteries made in their limbs; for these others suffered\nthe soul, a more delicate and noble part, to be cauterised.\n\nBut to end where I began: the Emperor Adrian, disputing with the\nphilosopher Favorinus about the interpretation of some word, Favorinus\nsoon yielded him the victory; for which his friends rebuking him, \u201cYou\ntalk simply,\u201d said he; \u201cwould you not have him wiser than I, who commands\nthirty legions?\u201d  Augustus wrote verses against Asinius Pollio, and \u201cI,\u201d\n said Pollio, \u201csay nothing, for it is not prudence to write in contest\nwith him who has power to proscribe.\u201d  And they were right.  For\nDionysius, because he could not equal Philoxenus in poesy and Plato in\ndiscourse, condemned the one to the quarries, and sent the other to be\nsold for a slave into the island of AEgina.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nOF THE ART OF CONFERENCE\n\n\u2018Tis a custom of our justice to condemn some for a warning to others.  To\ncondemn them for having done amiss, were folly, as Plato says,\n\n     [Diogenes Laertius, however, in his Life of Plato, iii. 181, says\n     that Plato\u2019s offence was the speaking too freely to the tyrant.]\n\nfor what is done can never be undone; but \u2018tis to the end they may offend\nno more, and that others may avoid the example of their offence: we do\nnot correct the man we hang; we correct others by him.  I do the same; my\nerrors are sometimes natural, incorrigible, and irremediable: but the\ngood which virtuous men do to the public, in making themselves imitated,\nI, peradventure, may do in making my manners avoided:\n\n         \u201cNonne vides, Albi ut male vivat filius? utque\n          Barrus inops?  magnum documentum, ne patriam rein\n          Perdere guis velit;\u201d\n\n     [\u201cDost thou not see how ill the son of Albus lives?  and how the\n     indigent Barrus? a great warning lest any one should incline to\n     dissipate his patrimony.\u201d--Horace, Sat., i. 4, 109.]\n\npublishing and accusing my own imperfections, some one will learn to be\nafraid of them.  The parts that I most esteem in myself, derive more\nhonour from decrying, than for commending myself which is the reason why\nI so often fall into, and so much insist upon that strain.  But, when all\nis summed up, a man never speaks of himself without loss; a man\u2019s\naccusations of himself are always believed; his praises never: There may,\nperadventure, be some of my own complexion who better instruct myself by\ncontrariety than by similitude, and by avoiding than by imitation.  The\nelder Cato was regarding this sort of discipline, when he said, \u201cthat the\nwise may learn more of fools, than fools can of the wise\u201d; and Pausanias\ntells us of an ancient player upon the harp, who was wont to make his\nscholars go to hear one who played very ill, who lived over against him,\nthat they might learn to hate his discords and false measures.  The\nhorror of cruelty more inclines me to clemency, than any example of\nclemency could possibly do.  A good rider does not so much mend my seat,\nas an awkward attorney or a Venetian, on horseback; and a clownish way of\nspeaking more reforms mine than the most correct.  The ridiculous and\nsimple look of another always warns and advises me; that which pricks,\nrouses and incites much better than that which tickles.  The time is now\nproper for us to reform backward; more by dissenting than by agreeing; by\ndiffering more than by consent.  Profiting little by good examples, I\nmake use of those that are ill, which are everywhere to be found: I\nendeavour to render myself as agreeable as I see others offensive; as\nconstant as I see others fickle; as affable as I see others rough; as\ngood as I see others evil: but I propose to myself impracticable\nmeasures.\n\nThe most fruitful and natural exercise of the mind, in my opinion, is\nconversation; I find the use of it more sweet than of any other action of\nlife; and for that reason it is that, if I were now compelled to choose,\nI should sooner, I think, consent to lose my sight, than my hearing and\nspeech.  The Athenians, and also the Romans, kept this exercise in great\nhonour in their academies; the Italians retain some traces of it to this\nday, to their great advantage, as is manifest by the comparison of our\nunderstandings with theirs.  The study of books is a languishing and\nfeeble motion that heats not, whereas conversation teaches and exercises\nat once.  If I converse with a strong mind and a rough disputant, he\npresses upon my flanks, and pricks me right and left; his imaginations\nstir up mine; jealousy, glory, and contention, stimulate and raise me up\nto something above myself; and acquiescence is a quality altogether\ntedious in discourse.  But, as our mind fortifies itself by the\ncommunication of vigorous and regular understandings, \u2018tis not to be\nexpressed how much it loses and degenerates by the continual commerce and\nfamiliarity we have with mean and weak spirits; there is no contagion\nthat spreads like that; I know sufficiently by experience what \u2018tis worth\na yard.  I love to discourse and dispute, but it is with but few men, and\nfor myself; for to do it as a spectacle and entertainment to great\npersons, and to make of a man\u2019s wit and words competitive parade is, in\nmy opinion, very unbecoming a man of honour.\n\nFolly is a bad quality; but not to be able to endure it, to fret and vex\nat it, as I do, is another sort of disease little less troublesome than\nfolly itself; and is the thing that I will now accuse in myself.  I enter\ninto conference, and dispute with great liberty and facility, forasmuch\nas opinion meets in me with a soil very unfit for penetration, and\nwherein to take any deep root; no propositions astonish me, no belief\noffends me, though never so contrary to my own; there is no so frivolous\nand extravagant fancy that does not seem to me suitable to the production\nof human wit.  We, who deprive our judgment of the right of determining,\nlook indifferently upon the diverse opinions, and if we incline not our\njudgment to them, yet we easily give them the hearing: Where one scale is\ntotally empty, I let the other waver under an old wife\u2019s dreams; and I\nthink myself excusable, if I prefer the odd number; Thursday rather than\nFriday; if I had rather be the twelfth or fourteenth than the thirteenth\nat table; if I had rather, on a journey, see a hare run by me than cross\nmy way, and rather give my man my left foot than my right, when he comes\nto put on my stockings.  All such reveries as are in credit around us,\ndeserve at least a hearing: for my part, they only with me import\ninanity, but they import that.  Moreover, vulgar and casual opinions are\nsomething more than nothing in nature; and he who will not suffer himself\nto proceed so far, falls, peradventure, into the vice of obstinacy, to\navoid that of superstition.\n\nThe contradictions of judgments, then, neither offend nor alter, they\nonly rouse and exercise, me. We evade correction, whereas we ought to\noffer and present ourselves to it, especially when it appears in the form\nof conference, and not of authority.  At every opposition, we do not\nconsider whether or no it be dust, but, right or wrong, how to disengage\nourselves: instead of extending the arms, we thrust out our claws.  I\ncould suffer myself to be rudely handled by my friend, so much as to tell\nme that I am a fool, and talk I know not of what.  I love stout\nexpressions amongst gentle men, and to have them speak as they think; we\nmust fortify and harden our hearing against this tenderness of the\nceremonious sound of words. I love a strong and manly familiarity and\nconversation: a friendship that pleases itself in the sharpness and\nvigour of its communication, like love in biting and scratching: it is\nnot vigorous and generous enough, if it be not quarrelsome, if it be\ncivilised and artificial, if it treads nicely and fears the shock:\n\n       \u201cNeque enim disputari sine reprehensione potest.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cNeither can a man dispute, but he must contradict.\u201d\n      (Or:) \u201cNor can people dispute without reprehension.\u201d\n      --Cicero, De Finib., i. 8.]\n\nWhen any one contradicts me, he raises my attention, not my anger: I\nadvance towards him who controverts, who instructs me; the cause of truth\nought to be the common cause both of the one and the other.  What will\nthe angry man answer?  Passion has already confounded his judgment;\nagitation has usurped the place of reason.  It were not amiss that the\ndecision of our disputes should pass by wager: that there might be a\nmaterial mark of our losses, to the end we might the better remember\nthem; and that my man might tell me: \u201cYour ignorance and obstinacy cost\nyou last year, at several times, a hundred crowns.\u201d  I hail and caress\ntruth in what quarter soever I find it, and cheerfully surrender myself,\nand open my conquered arms as far off as I can discover it; and, provided\nit be not too imperiously, take a pleasure in being reproved, and\naccommodate myself to my accusers, very often more by reason of civility\nthan amendment, loving to gratify and nourish the liberty of admonition\nby my facility of submitting to it, and this even at my own expense.\n\nNevertheless, it is hard to bring the men of my time to it: they have not\nthe courage to correct, because they have not the courage to suffer\nthemselves to be corrected; and speak always with dissimulation in the\npresence of one another: I take so great a pleasure in being judged and\nknown, that it is almost indifferent to me in which of the two forms I am\nso: my imagination so often contradicts and condemns itself, that \u2018tis\nall one to me if another do it, especially considering that I give his\nreprehension no greater authority than I choose; but I break with him,\nwho carries himself so high, as I know of one who repents his advice,\nif not believed, and takes it for an affront if it be not immediately\nfollowed.  That Socrates always received smilingly the contradictions\noffered to his arguments, a man may say arose from his strength of\nreason; and that, the advantage being certain to fall on his side, he\naccepted them as a matter of new victory.  But we see, on the contrary,\nthat nothing in argument renders our sentiment so delicate, as the\nopinion of pre-eminence, and disdain of the adversary; and that, in\nreason, \u2018tis rather for the weaker to take in good part the oppositions\nthat correct him and set him right.  In earnest, I rather choose the\ncompany of those who ruffle me than of those who fear me; \u2018tis a dull and\nhurtful pleasure to have to do with people who admire us and approve of\nall we say.  Antisthenes commanded his children never to take it kindly\nor for a favour, when any man commended them.  I find I am much prouder\nof the victory I obtain over myself, when, in the very ardour of dispute,\nI make myself submit to my adversary\u2019s force of reason, than I am pleased\nwith the victory I obtain over him through his weakness.  In fine, I\nreceive and admit of all manner of attacks that are direct, how weak\nsoever; but I am too impatient of those that are made out of form.  I\ncare not what the subject is, the opinions are to me all one, and I am\nalmost indifferent whether I get the better or the worse.  I can\npeaceably argue a whole day together, if the argument be carried on with\nmethod; I do not so much require force and subtlety as order; I mean the\norder which we every day observe in the wranglings of shepherds and\nshop-boys, but never amongst us: if they start from their subject, \u2018tis\nout of incivility, and so \u2018tis with us; but their tumult and impatience\nnever put them out of their theme; their argument still continues its\ncourse; if they interrupt, and do not stay for one another, they at least\nunderstand one another.  Any one answers too well for me, if he answers\nwhat I say: when the dispute is irregular and disordered, I leave the\nthing itself, and insist upon the form with anger and indiscretion;\nfalling into wilful, malicious, and imperious way of disputation, of\nwhich I am afterwards ashamed.  \u2018Tis impossible to deal fairly with a\nfool: my judgment is not only corrupted under the hand of so impetuous a\nmaster, but my conscience also.\n\nOur disputes ought to be interdicted and punished as well as other verbal\ncrimes: what vice do they not raise and heap up, being always governed\nand commanded by passion?  We first quarrel with their reasons, and then\nwith the men.  We only learn to dispute that we may contradict; and so,\nevery one contradicting and being contradicted, it falls out that the\nfruit of disputation is to lose and annihilate truth.  Therefore it is\nthat Plato in his Republic prohibits this exercise to fools and ill-bred\npeople.  To what end do you go about to inquire of him, who knows nothing\nto the purpose?  A man does no injury to the subject, when he leaves it\nto seek how he may treat it; I do not mean by an artificial and\nscholastic way, but by a natural one, with a sound understanding.  What\nwill it be in the end?  One flies to the east, the other to the west;\nthey lose the principal, dispersing it in the crowd of incidents after an\nhour of tempest, they know not what they seek: one is low, the other\nhigh, and a third wide.  One catches at a word and a simile; another is\nno longer sensible of what is said in opposition to him, and thinks only\nof going on at his own rate, not of answering you: another, finding\nhimself too weak to make good his rest, fears all, refuses all, at the\nvery beginning, confounds the subject; or, in the very height of the\ndispute, stops short and is silent, by a peevish ignorance affecting a\nproud contempt or a foolishly  modest avoidance of further debate:\nprovided this man strikes, he cares not how much he lays himself open;\nthe other counts his words, and weighs them for reasons; another only\nbrawls, and uses the advantage of his lungs.  Here\u2019s one who learnedly\nconcludes against himself, and another who deafens you with prefaces and\nsenseless digressions: an other falls into downright railing, and seeks a\nquarrel after the German fashion, to disengage himself from a wit that\npresses too hard upon him: and a last man sees nothing into the reason of\nthe thing, but draws a line of circumvallation about you of dialectic\nclauses, and the formulas of his art.\n\nNow, who would not enter into distrust of sciences, and doubt whether he\ncan reap from them any solid fruit for the service of life, considering\nthe use we put them to?\n\n                    \u201cNihil sanantibus litteris.\u201d\n\n          [\u201cLetters which cure nothing.\u201d--Seneca, Ep., 59.]\n\nWho has got understanding by his logic?  Where are all her fair promises?\n\n          \u201cNec ad melius vivendum, nec ad commodius disserendum.\u201d\n\n          [\u201cIt neither makes a man live better nor talk better.\u201d\n           --Cicero, De Fin., i. 19.]\n\nIs there more noise or confusion in the scolding of herring-wives than in\nthe public disputes of men of this profession?  I had rather my son\nshould learn in a tap-house to speak, than in the schools to prate.  Take\na master of arts, and confer with him: why does he not make us sensible\nof this artificial excellence? and why does he not captivate women and\nignoramuses, as we are, with admiration at the steadiness of his reasons\nand the beauty of his order? why does he not sway and persuade us to what\nhe will? why does a man, who has so much advantage in matter and\ntreatment, mix railing, indiscretion, and fury in his disputations?\nStrip him of his gown, his hood, and his Latin, let him not batter our\nears with Aristotle, pure and simple, you will take him for one of us,\nor worse.  Whilst they torment us with this complication and confusion of\nwords, it fares with them, methinks, as with jugglers; their dexterity\nimposes upon our senses, but does not at all work upon our belief this\nlegerdemain excepted, they perform nothing that is not very ordinary and\nmean: for being the more learned, they are none the less fools.\n\n     [So Hobbes said that if he had read as much as the academical\n     pedants he should have known as little.]\n\nI love and honour knowledge as much as they that have it, and in its true\nuse \u2018tis the most noble and the greatest acquisition of men; but in such\nas I speak of (and the number of them is infinite), who build their\nfundamental sufficiency and value upon it, who appeal from their\nunderstanding to their memory:\n\n                    \u201cSub aliena umbra latentes,\u201d\n\n     [\u201cSheltering under the shadow of others.\u201d--Seneca, Ep., 33.]\n\nand who can do nothing but by book, I hate it, if I dare to say so, worse\nthan stupidity.  In my country, and in my time, learning improves\nfortunes enough, but not minds; if it meet with those that are dull and\nheavy, it overcharges and suffocates them, leaving them a crude and\nundigested mass; if airy and fine, it purifies, clarifies, and subtilises\nthem, even to exinanition.  \u2018Tis a thing of almost indifferent quality;\na very useful accession to a well-born soul, but hurtful and pernicious\nto others; or rather a thing of very precious use, that will not suffer\nitself to be purchased at an under rate; in the hand of some \u2018tis a\nsceptre, in that of others a fool\u2019s bauble.\n\nBut let us proceed.  What greater victory do you expect than to make your\nenemy see and know that he is not able to encounter you?  When you get\nthe better of your argument; \u2018tis truth that wins; when you get the\nadvantage of form and method, \u2018tis then you who win.  I am of opinion that\nin, Plato and Xenophon Socrates disputes more in favour of the disputants\nthan in favour of the dispute, and more to instruct Euthydemus and\nProtagoras in the, knowledge of their impertinence, than in the\nimpertinence of their art.  He takes hold of the first subject like one\nwho has a more profitable end than to explain it--namely, to clear the\nunderstandings that he takes upon him to instruct and exercise.  To hunt\nafter truth is properly our business, and we are inexcusable if we carry\non the chase impertinently and ill; to fail of seizing it is another\nthing, for we are born to inquire after truth: it belongs to a greater\npower to possess it.  It is not, as Democritus said, hid in the bottom of\nthe deeps, but rather elevated to an infinite height in the divine\nknowledge.  The world is but a school of inquisition: it is not who shall\nenter the ring, but who shall run the best courses.  He may as well play\nthe fool who speaks true, as he who speaks false, for we are upon the\nmanner, not the matter, of speaking.  \u2018Tis my humour as much to regard\nthe form as the substance, and the advocate as much as the cause, as\nAlcibiades ordered we should: and every day pass away my time in reading\nauthors without any consideration of their learning; their manner is what\nI look after, not their subject: And just so do I hunt after the\nconversation of any eminent wit, not that he may teach me, but that I may\nknow him, and that knowing him, if I think him worthy of imitation, I may\nimitate him.  Every man may speak truly, but to speak methodically,\nprudently, and fully, is a talent that few men have.  The falsity that\nproceeds from ignorance does not offend me, but the foppery of it.  I\nhave broken off several treaties  that would have been of advantage to\nme, by reason of the impertinent contestations of those with whom I\ntreated.  I am not moved once in a year at the faults of those over whom\nI have authority, but upon the account of the ridiculous obstinacy of\ntheir allegations, denials, excuses, we are every day going together by\nthe ears; they neither understand what is said, nor why, and answer\naccordingly; \u2018tis enough to drive a man mad.  I never feel any hurt upon\nmy head but when \u2018tis knocked against another, and more easily forgive\nthe vices of my servants than their boldness, importunity, and folly; let\nthem do less, provided they understand what they do: you live in hope to\nwarm their affection to your service, but there is nothing to be had or\nto be expected from a stock.\n\nBut what, if I take things otherwise than they are?  Perhaps I do; and\ntherefore it is that I accuse my own impatience, and hold, in the first\nplace, that it is equally vicious both in him that is in the right, and\nin him that is in the wrong; for \u2018tis always a tyrannic sourness not to\nendure a form contrary to one\u2019s own: and, besides, there cannot, in\ntruth, be a greater, more constant, nor more irregular folly than to be\nmoved and angry at the follies of the world, for it principally makes us\nquarrel with ourselves; and the old philosopher never wanted an occasion\nfor his tears whilst he considered himself.  Miso, one of the seven\nsages, of a Timonian and Democritic humour, being asked,  \u201cwhat he\nlaughed at, being alone?\u201d--\u201cThat I do laugh alone,\u201d answered he.  How\nmany ridiculous things, in my own opinion, do I say and answer every day\nthat comes over my head?  and then how many more, according to the\nopinion of others?  If I bite my own lips, what ought others to do?  In\nfine, we must live amongst the living, and let the river run under the\nbridge without our care, or, at least, without our interference.  In\ntruth, why do we meet a man with a hunch-back, or any other deformity,\nwithout being moved, and cannot endure the encounter of a deformed mind\nwithout being angry?  this vicious sourness sticks more to the judge than\nto the crime.  Let us always have this saying of Plato in our mouths: \u201cDo\nnot I think things unsound, because I am not sound in myself?  Am I not\nmyself in fault?  may not my observations reflect upon myself?\u201d--a wise\nand divine saying, that lashes the most universal and common error of\nmankind.  Not only the reproaches that we throw in the face of one\nanother, but our reasons also, our arguments and controversies, are\nreboundable upon us, and we wound ourselves with our own weapons: of\nwhich antiquity has left me enough grave examples.  It was ingeniously\nand home-said by him, who was the inventor of this sentence:\n\n                    \u201cStercus cuique suum bene olet.\u201d\n\n          [\u201cTo every man his own excrements smell well.\u201d--Erasmus]\n\nWe see nothing behind us; we mock ourselves an hundred times a day; when\nwe deride our neighbours; and we detest in others the defects which are\nmore manifest in us, and which we admire with marvellous inadvertency and\nimpudence.  It was but yesterday that I heard a man of understanding and\nof good rank, as pleasantly as justly scoffing at the folly of another,\nwho did nothing but torment everybody with the catalogue of his genealogy\nand alliances, above half of them false (for they are most apt to fall\ninto such ridiculous discourses, whose qualities are most dubious and\nleast sure), and yet, would he have looked into himself, he would have\ndiscerned himself to be no less intemperate and wearisome in extolling\nhis wife\u2019s pedigree.  O importunate presumption, with which the wife sees\nherself armed by the hands of her own husband.  Did he understand Latin,\nwe should say to him:\n\n          \u201cAge, si hic non insanit satis sua sponte, instiga.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cCome!  if of himself he is not mad enough, urge him on.\u201d\n      --Terence, And., iv. 2, 9.]\n\nI do not say that no man should accuse another, who is not clean\nhimself,--for then no one would ever accuse,--clean from the same sort of\nspot; but I mean that our judgment, falling upon another who is then in\nquestion, should not, at the same time, spare ourselves, but sentence us\nwith an inward and severe authority.  \u2018Tis an office of charity, that he\nwho cannot reclaim himself from a vice, should, nevertheless, endeavour\nto remove it from another, in whom, peradventure, it may not have so deep\nand so malignant a root; neither do him who reproves me for my fault that\nhe himself is guilty of the same.  What of that?  The reproof is,\nnotwithstanding, true and of very good use.  Had we a good nose, our own\nordure would stink worse to us, forasmuch as it is our own: and Socrates\nis of opinion that whoever should find himself, his son, and a stranger\nguilty of any violence and wrong, ought to begin with himself, present\nhimself first to the sentence of justice, and implore, to purge himself,\nthe assistance of the hand of the executioner; in the next place, he\nshould proceed to his son, and lastly, to the stranger.  If this precept\nseem too severe, he ought at least to present himself the first, to the\npunishment of his own conscience.\n\nThe senses are our first and proper judges, which perceive not things but\nby external accidents; and \u2018tis no wonder, if in all the parts of the\nservice of our society, there is so perpetual and universal a mixture of\nceremonies and superficial appearances; insomuch that the best and most\neffectual part of our polities therein consist.  \u2018Tis still man with whom\nwe have to do, of whom the condition is wonderfully corporal.  Let those\nwho, of these late years, would erect for us such a contemplative and\nimmaterial an exercise of religion, not wonder if there be some who think\nit had vanished and melted through their fingers had it not more upheld\nitself among us as a mark, title, and instrument of division and faction,\nthan by itself.  As in conference, the gravity, robe, and fortune of him\nwho speaks, ofttimes gives reputation to vain arguments and idle words,\nit is not to be presumed but that a man, so attended and feared, has not\nin him more than ordinary sufficiency; and that he to whom the king has\ngiven so many offices and commissions and charges, he so supercilious and\nproud, has not a great deal more in him, than another who salutes him at\nso great a distance, and who has no employment at all.  Not only the\nwords, but the grimaces also of these people, are considered and put into\nthe account; every one making it his business to give them some fine and\nsolid interpretation.  If they stoop to the common conference, and that\nyou offer anything but approbation and reverence, they then knock you\ndown with the authority of their experience: they have heard, they have\nseen, they have done so and so: you are crushed with examples.  I should\nwillingly tell them, that the fruit of a surgeon\u2019s experience, is not the\nhistory of his practice and his remembering that he has cured four people\nof the plague and three of the gout, unless he knows how thence to\nextract something whereon to form his judgment, and to make us sensible\nthat he has thence become more skillful in his art.  As in a concert of\ninstruments, we do not hear a lute, a harpsichord, or a flute alone, but\none entire harmony, the result of all together.  If travel and offices\nhave improved them, \u2018tis a product of their understanding to make it\nappear.  \u2018Tis not enough to reckon experiences, they must weigh, sort and\ndistil them, to extract the reasons and conclusions they carry along with\nthem.  There were never so many historians: it is, indeed, good and of\nuse to read them, for they furnish us everywhere with excellent and\nlaudable instructions from the magazine of their memory, which,\ndoubtless, is of great concern to the help of life; but \u2018tis not that we\nseek for now: we examine whether these relaters and collectors of things\nare commendable themselves.\n\nI hate all sorts of tyranny, both in word and deed.  I am very ready to\noppose myself against those vain circumstances that delude our judgments\nby the senses; and keeping my eye close upon those extraordinary\ngreatnesses, I find that at best they are men, as others are:\n\n          \u201cRarus enim ferme sensus communis in illa\n          Fortuna.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cFor in those high fortunes, common sense is generally rare.\u201d\n      --Juvenal, viii. 73.]\n\nPeradventure, we esteem and look upon them for less than they are, by\nreason they undertake more, and more expose themselves; they do not\nanswer to the charge they have undertaken.  There must be more vigour and\nstrength in the bearer than in the burden; he who has not lifted as much\nas he can, leaves you to guess that he has still a strength beyond that,\nand that he has not been tried to the utmost of what he is able to do; he\nwho sinks under his load, makes a discovery of his best, and the weakness\nof his shoulders.  This is the reason that we see so many silly souls\namongst the learned, and more than those of the better sort: they would\nhave made good husbandmen, good merchants, and good artisans: their\nnatural vigour was cut out to that proportion.  Knowledge is a thing of\ngreat weight, they faint under it: their understanding has neither vigour\nnor dexterity enough to set forth and distribute, to employ or make use\nof this rich and powerful matter; it has no prevailing virtue but in a\nstrong nature; and such natures are very rare--and the weak ones, says\nSocrates, corrupt the dignity of philosophy in the handling, it appears\nuseless and vicious, when lodged in an ill-contrived mind.  They spoil\nand make fools of themselves:\n\n              \u201cHumani qualis simulator simius oris,\n               Quern puer arridens pretioso stamine serum\n               Velavit, nudasque nates ac terga reliquit,\n               Ludibrium mensis.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cJust like an ape, simulator of the human face, whom a wanton boy\n     has dizened up in rich silks above, but left the lower parts bare,\n     for a laughing-stock for the tables.\u201d\n      --Claudian, in Eutrop., i 303.]\n\nNeither is it enough for those who govern and command us, and have all\nthe world in their hands, to have a common understanding, and to be able\nto do the same that we can; they are very much below us, if they be not\ninfinitely above us: as they promise more, so they are to perform more.\n\nAnd yet silence is to them, not only a countenance of respect and\ngravity, but very often of good advantage too: for Megabyzus, going \u2018to\nsee Apelles in his painting-room, stood a great while without speaking a\nword, and at last began to talk of his paintings, for which he received\nthis rude reproof: \u201cWhilst thou wast silent, thou seemedst to be some\ngreat thing, by reason of thy chains and rich habit; but now that we have\nheard thee speak, there is not the meanest boy in my workshop that does\nnot despise thee.\u201d  Those princely ornaments, that mighty state, did not\npermit him to be ignorant with a common ignorance, and to speak\nimpertinently of painting; he ought to have kept this external and\npresumptive knowledge by silence.  To how many foolish fellows of my time\nhas a sullen and silent mien procured the credit of prudence and\ncapacity!\n\nDignities and offices are of necessity conferred more by fortune than\nupon the account of merit; and we are often to blame, to condemn kings\nwhen these are misplaced: on the contrary, \u2018tis a wonder they should have\nso good luck, where there is so little skill:\n\n               \u201cPrincipis est virtus maxima nosse suos;\u201d\n\n          [\u201c\u2018Tis the chief virtue of a prince to know his people.\u201d\n           --Martial, viii. 15.]\n\nfor nature has not given them a sight that can extend to so many people,\nto discern which excels the rest, nor to penetrate into our bosoms, where\nthe knowledge of our wills and best value lies they must choose us by\nconjecture and by groping; by the family, wealth, learning, and the voice\nof the people, which are all very feeble arguments.  Whoever could find\nout a way by which they might judge by justice, and choose men by reason,\nwould, in this one thing, establish a perfect form of government.\n\n\u201cAy, but he brought that great affair to a very good pass.\u201d  This is,\nindeed, to say something, but not to say enough: for this sentence is\njustly received, \u201cThat we are not to judge of counsels by events.\u201d\n The Carthaginians punished the ill counsels of their captains, though\nthey were rectified by a successful issue; and the Roman people often\ndenied a triumph for great and very advantageous victories because the\nconduct of their general was not answerable to his good fortune.\nWe ordinarily see, in the actions of the world, that Fortune, to shew\nus her power in all things, and who takes a pride in abating our\npresumption, seeing she could not make fools wise, has made them\nfortunate in emulation of virtue; and most favours those operations the\nweb of which is most purely her own; whence it is that the simplest\namongst us bring to pass great business, both public and private; and,\nas Seiramnes, the Persian, answered those who wondered that his affairs\nsucceeded so ill, considering that his deliberations were so wise, \u201cthat\nhe was sole master of his designs, but that success was wholly in the\npower of fortune\u201d;  these may answer the same, but with a contrary turn.\nMost worldly affairs are performed by themselves\n\n                         \u201cFata viam inveniunt;\u201d\n\n          [\u201cThe destinies find the way.\u201d--AEneid, iii. 395]\n\nthe event often justifies a very foolish conduct; our interposition is\nlittle more than as it were a running on by rote, and more commonly a\nconsideration of custom and example, than of reason.  Being formerly\nastonished at the greatness of some affair, I have been made acquainted\nwith their motives and address by those who had performed it, and have\nfound nothing in it but very ordinary counsels; and the most common and\nusual are indeed, perhaps, the most sure and convenient for practice, if\nnot for show.  What if the plainest reasons are the best seated?  the\nmeanest, lowest, and most beaten more adapted to affairs?  To maintain\nthe authority of the counsels of kings, it needs not that profane persons\nshould participate of them, or see further into them than the outmost\nbarrier; he who will husband its reputation must be reverenced upon\ncredit and taken altogether.  My consultation somewhat rough-hews the\nmatter, and considers it lightly by the first face it presents: the\nstress and main of the business I have been wont to refer to heaven;\n\n                         \u201cPermitte divis caetera.\u201d\n\n          [\u201cLeave the rest to the gods.\u201d--Horace, Od., i.  9, 9.]\n\nGood and ill fortune are, in my opinion, two sovereign powers; \u2018tis folly\nto think that human prudence can play the part of Fortune; and vain is\nhis attempt who presumes to comprehend both causes and consequences, and\nby the hand to conduct the progress of his design; and most especially\nvain in the deliberations of war.  There was never greater circumspection\nand military prudence than sometimes is seen amongst us: can it be that\nmen are afraid to lose themselves by the way, that they reserve\nthemselves to the end of the game?  I moreover affirm that our wisdom\nitself and consultation, for the most part commit themselves to the\nconduct of chance; my will and my reason are sometimes moved by one\nbreath, and sometimes by another; and many of these movements there are\nthat govern themselves without me: my reason has uncertain and casual\nagitations and impulsions:\n\n         \u201cVertuntur species animorum, et pectora motus\n          Nunc alios, alios, dum nubila ventus agebat,\n          Concipiunt.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThe aspects of their minds change; and they conceive now such\n     ideas, now such, just so long as the wind agitated the clouds.\u201d\n      --Virgil, Georg., i.  42.]\n\nLet a man but observe who are of greatest authority in cities, and who\nbest do their own business; we shall find that they are commonly men of\nthe least parts: women, children, and madmen have had the fortune to\ngovern great kingdoms equally well with the wisest princes, and\nThucydides says, that the stupid more ordinarily do it than those of\nbetter understandings; we attribute the effects of their good fortune to\ntheir prudence:\n\n                    \u201cUt quisque Fortuna utitur,\n          Ita praecellet; atque exinde sapere illum omnes dicimus;\u201d\n\n     [\u201cHe makes his way who knows how to use Fortune, and thereupon we\n     all call him wise.\u201d--Plautus, Pseudol., ii. 3, 13.]\n\nwherefore I say unreservedly, events are a very poor testimony of our\nworth and parts.\n\nNow, I was upon this point, that there needs no more but to see a man\npromoted to dignity; though we knew him but three days before a man of\nlittle regard, yet an image of grandeur of sufficiency insensibly steals\ninto our opinion, and we persuade ourselves that, being augmented in\nreputation and train, he is also increased in merit; we judge of him, not\naccording to his worth, but as we do by counters, according to the\nprerogative of his place.  If it happen so that he fall again, and be\nmixed with the common crowd, every one inquires with amazement into the\ncause of his having been raised so high.  \u201cIs this he,\u201d say they, \u201cwas he\nno wiser when he was there?  Do princes satisfy themselves with so\nlittle?  Truly, we were in good hands.\u201d  This is a thing that I have\noften seen in my time.  Nay, even the very disguise of grandeur\nrepresented in our comedies in some sort moves and gulls us.  That which\nI myself adore in kings is the crowd of their adorers; all reverence and\nsubmission are due to them, except that of the understanding: my reason\nis not obliged to bow and bend; my knees are.  Melanthius being asked\nwhat he thought of the tragedy of Dionysius, \u201cI could not see it,\u201d said\nhe, \u201cit was so clouded with language\u201d; so most of those who judge of the\ndiscourses of great men ought to say, \u201cI did not understand his words,\nthey were so clouded with gravity, grandeur, and majesty.\u201d  Antisthenes\none day tried to persuade the Athenians to give order that their asses\nmight be employed in tilling the ground as well as the horses were; to\nwhich it was answered that that animal was not destined for such a\nservice: \u201cThat\u2019s all one,\u201d replied he, \u201cyou have only to order it: for\nthe most ignorant and incapable men you employ in the commands of your\nwars incontinently become worthy enough, because you employ them\u201d; to\nwhich the custom of so many people, who canonise the king they have\nchosen out of their own body, and are not content only to honour, but\nmust adore them, comes very near.  Those of Mexico, after the ceremonies\nof their king\u2019s coronation are over, dare no more look him in the face;\nbut, as if they had deified him by his royalty.  Amongst the oaths they\nmake him take to maintain their religion, their laws, and liberties, to\nbe valiant, just, and mild, he moreover swears to make the sun run his\ncourse in his wonted light, to drain the clouds at fit seasons, to make\nrivers run their course, and to cause the earth to bear all things\nnecessary for his people.\n\nI differ from this common fashion, and am more apt to suspect the\ncapacity when I see it accompanied with that grandeur of fortune and\npublic applause; we are to consider of what advantage it is to speak when\na man pleases, to choose his subject, to interrupt or change it, with a\nmagisterial authority; to protect himself from the oppositions of others\nby a nod, a smile, or silence, in the presence of an assembly that\ntrembles with reverence and respect.  A man of a prodigious fortune\ncoming to give his judgment upon some slight dispute that was foolishly\nset on foot at his table, began in these words: \u201cIt can be no other but\na liar or a fool that will say otherwise than so and so.\u201d  Pursue this\nphilosophical point with a dagger in your hand.\n\nThere is another observation I have made, from which I draw great\nadvantage; which is, that in conferences and disputes, every word that\nseems to be good, is not immediately to be accepted.  Most men are rich\nin borrowed sufficiency: a man may say a good thing, give a good answer,\ncite a good sentence, without at all seeing the force of either the one\nor the other.  That a man may not understand all he borrows, may perhaps\nbe verified in myself.  A man must not always presently yield, what truth\nor beauty soever may seem to be in the opposite argument; either he must\nstoutly meet it, or retire, under colour of not understanding it, to try,\non all parts, how it is lodged in the author.  It may happen that we\nentangle ourselves, and help to strengthen the point itself.  I have\nsometimes, in the necessity and heat of the combat, made answers that\nhave gone through and through, beyond my expectation or hope; I only gave\nthem in number, they were received in weight.  As, when I contend with a\nvigorous man, I please myself with anticipating his conclusions, I ease\nhim of the trouble of explaining himself, I strive to forestall his\nimagination whilst it is yet springing and imperfect; the order and\npertinency of his understanding warn and threaten me afar off: I deal\nquite contrary with the others; I must understand, and presuppose nothing\nbut by them.  If they determine in general words, \u201cthis is good, that is\nnaught,\u201d and that they happen to be in the right, see if it be not\nfortune that hits it off for them: let them a little circumscribe and\nlimit their judgment; why, or how, it is so.  These universal judgments\nthat I see so common, signify nothing; these are men who salute a whole\npeople in a crowd together; they, who have a real acquaintance, take\nnotice of and salute them individually and by name.  But \u2018tis a hazardous\nattempt; and from which I have, more than every day, seen it fall out,\nthat weak understandings, having a mind to appear ingenious, in taking\nnotice, as they read a book, of what is best and most to be admired, fix\ntheir admiration upon some thing so very ill chosen, that instead of\nmaking us discern the excellence of the author; they make us very well\nsee their own ignorance.  This exclamation is safe, \u201cThat is fine,\u201d after\nhaving heard a whole page of Virgil;  by that the cunning sort save\nthemselves; but to undertake to follow him line by line, and, with an\nexpert and tried judgment, to observe where a good author excels himself,\nweighing the words, phrases, inventions, and his various excellences, one\nafter another; keep aloof from that:\n\n     \u201cVidendum est, non modo quid quisque loquatur, sed etiam quid\n     quisque sentiat, atque etiam qua de causa quisque sentiat.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cA man is not only to examine what every one says, but also what\n     every one thinks, and from what reason every one thinks.\u201d\n      --Cicero, De Offic:, i. 41.]\n\nI every day hear fools say things that are not foolish: they say a good\nthing; let us examine how far they understand it, whence they have it,\nand what they mean by it.  We help them to make use of this fine\nexpression, of this fine sentence, which is none of theirs; they only\nhave it in keeping; they have bolted it out at a venture; we place it for\nthem in credit and esteem.  You lend them your hand.  To what purpose?\nthey do not think themselves obliged to you for it, and become more inept\nstill.  Don\u2019t help them; let them alone; they will handle the matter like\npeople who are afraid of burning their fingers; they dare change neither\nits seat nor light, nor break into it; shake it never so little, it slips\nthrough their fingers; they give it up, be it never so strong or fair\nthey are fine weapons, but ill hafted: How many times have I seen the\nexperience of this?  Now, if you come to explain anything to them, and to\nconfirm them, they catch at it, and presently rob you of the advantage of\nyour interpretation; \u201cIt was what I was about to say; it was just my\nidea; if I did not express it so, it was for want of language.\u201d  Mere\nwind!  Malice itself must be employed to correct this arrogant ignorance.\nThe dogma of Hegesias, \u201cthat we are neither to hate nor accuse, but\ninstruct,\u201d is correct elsewhere; but here \u2018tis injustice and inhumanity\nto relieve and set him right who stands in no need on\u2019t, and is the worse\nfor\u2019t.  I love to let them step deeper into the mire; and so deep, that,\nif it be possible, they may at last discern their error.\n\nFolly and absurdity are not to be cured by bare admonition; and what\nCyrus answered to him, who importuned him to harangue his army, upon the\npoint of battle, \u201cthat men do not become valiant and warlike upon a\nsudden, by a fine oration, no more than a man becomes a good musician by\nhearing a fine song,\u201d may properly be said of such an admonition as this.\nThese are apprenticeships that are to be served beforehand, by a long and\ncontinued education.  We owe this care and this assiduity of correction\nand instruction to our own people; but to go preach to the first\npasser-by, and to become tutor to the ignorance and folly of the first we\nmeet, is a thing that I abhor.  I rarely do it, even in private\nconversation, and rather give up the whole thing than proceed to these\ninitiatory and school instructions; my humour is unfit either to speak or\nwrite for beginners; but for things that are said in common discourse, or\namongst other things, I never oppose them either by word or sign, how\nfalse or absurd soever.\n\nAs to the rest, nothing vexes me so much in folly as that it is more\nsatisfied with itself than any reason can reasonably be.  \u2018Tis\nunfortunate that prudence forbids us to satisfy and trust ourselves,\nand always dismisses us timorous and discontented; whereas obstinacy and\ntemerity fill those who are possessed with them with joy and assurance.\n\u2018Tis for the most ignorant to look at other men over the shoulder, always\nreturning from the combat full of joy and triumph.  And moreover, for the\nmost part, this arrogance of speech and gaiety of countenance gives them\nthe better of it in the opinion of the audience, which is commonly weak\nand incapable of well judging and discerning the real advantage.\nObstinacy of opinion and heat in argument are the surest proofs of folly;\nis there anything so assured, resolute, disdainful, contemplative,\nserious and grave as the ass?\n\nMay we not include under the title of conference and communication the\nquick and sharp repartees which mirth and familiarity introduce amongst\nfriends, pleasantly and wittily jesting and rallying with one another?\n\u2018Tis an exercise for which my natural gaiety renders me fit enough, and\nwhich, if it be not so tense and serious as the other I spoke of but now,\nis, as Lycurgus thought, no less smart and ingenious, nor of less\nutility.  For my part, I contribute to it more liberty than wit, and have\ntherein more of luck than invention; but I am perfect in suffering, for I\nendure a retaliation that is not only tart, but indiscreet to boot,\nwithout being moved at all; and whoever attacks me, if I have not a brisk\nanswer immediately ready, I do not study to pursue the point with a\ntedious and impertinent contest, bordering upon obstinacy, but let it\npass, and hanging down cheerfully my ears, defer my revenge to another\nand better time: there is no merchant that always gains: Most men change\ntheir countenance and their voice where their wits fail, and by an\nunseasonable anger, instead of revenging themselves, accuse at once their\nown folly and impatience.  In this jollity, we sometimes pinch the secret\nstrings of our imperfections which, at another and graver time, we cannot\ntouch without offence, and so profitably give one another a hint of our\ndefects.  There are other jeux de main,--[practical jokes]--rude and\nindiscreet, after the French manner, that I mortally hate; my skin is\nvery tender and sensible: I have in my time seen two princes of the blood\nburied upon that very account.  \u2018Tis unhandsome to fight in play.  As to\nthe rest, when I have a mind to judge of any one, I ask him how far he is\ncontented with himself; to what degree his speaking or his work pleases\nhim.  I will none of these fine excuses, \u201cI did it only in sport,\n\n               \u2018Ablatum mediis opus est incudibus istud.\u2019\n\n          [\u201cThat work was taken from the anvil half finished.\u201d\n           --Ovid, Trist., i. 6, 29.]\n\nI was not an hour about it: I have never looked at it since.\u201d  Well,\nthen, say I, lay these aside, and give me a perfect one, such as you\nwould be measured by.  And then, what do you think is the best thing in\nyour work? is it this part or that? is it grace or the matter, the\ninvention, the judgment, or the learning?  For I find that men are,\ncommonly, as wide of the mark in judging of their own works, as of those\nof others; not only by reason of the kindness they have for them, but for\nwant of capacity to know and distinguish them: the work, by its own force\nand fortune, may second the workman, and sometimes outstrip him, beyond\nhis invention and knowledge.  For my part, I judge of the value of other\nmen\u2019s works more obscurely than of my own; and place the Essays, now\nhigh, or low, with great doubt and inconstancy.  There are several books\nthat are useful upon the account of their subjects, from which the author\nderives no praise; and good books, as well as good works, that shame the\nworkman.  I may write the manner of our feasts, and the fashion of our\nclothes, and may write them ill; I may publish the edicts of my time, and\nthe letters of princes that pass from hand to hand; I may make an\nabridgment of a good book (and every abridgment of a good book is a\nfoolish abridgment), which book shall come to be lost; and so on:\nposterity will derive a singular utility from such compositions: but what\nhonour shall I have unless by great good fortune?  Most part of the\nfamous books are of this condition.\n\nWhen I read Philip de Commines, doubtless a very good author, several\nyears ago, I there took notice of this for no vulgar saying, \u201cThat a man\nmust have a care not to do his master so great service, that at last he\nwill not know how to give him his just reward\u201d; but I ought to commend\nthe invention, not him, because I met with it in Tacitus, not long since:\n\n         \u201cBeneficia ea usque lxta sunt, dum videntur exsolvi posse;\n          ubi multum antevenere, pro gratis odium redditur;\u201d\n\n     [\u201cBenefits are so far acceptable as they appear to be capable of\n     recompense; where they much exceed that point, hatred is returned\n     instead of thanks.\u201d--Tacitus, Annal., iv. 18.]\n\nand Seneca vigorously says:\n\n                    \u201cNam qui putat esse turpe non reddere,\n                    non vult esse cui reddat:\u201d\n\n     [\u201cFor he who thinks it a shame not to requite, does not wish to\n     have the man live to whom he owes return.\u201d--Seneca, Ep., 81.]\n\nQ. Cicero says with less directness.:\n\n                   \u201cQui se non putat satisfacere,\n                    amicus esse nullo modo potest.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cWho thinks himself behind in obligation, can by no\n     means be a friend.\u201d--Q. Cicero, De Petitione Consul, c. 9.]\n\nThe subject, according to what it is, may make a man looked upon as\nlearned and of good memory; but to judge in him the parts that are most\nhis own and the most worthy, the vigour and beauty of his soul, one must\nfirst know what is his own and what is not; and in that which is not his\nown, how much we are obliged to him for the choice, disposition,\nornament, and language he has there presented us with.  What if he has\nborrowed the matter and spoiled the form, as it often falls out?  We, who\nare little read in books, are in this strait, that when we meet with a\nhigh fancy in some new poet, or some strong argument in a preacher, we\ndare not, nevertheless, commend it till we have first informed ourselves,\nthrough some learned man, if it be the writer\u2019s wit or borrowed from some\nother; until that I always stand upon my guard.\n\nI have lately been reading the history of Tacitus quite through, without\ninterrupting it with anything else (which but seldom happens with me, it\nbeing twenty years since I have kept to any one book an hour together),\nand I did it at the instance of a gentleman for whom France has a great\nesteem, as well for his own particular worth, as upon the account of a\nconstant form of capacity and virtue which runs through a great many\nbrothers of them.  I do not know any author in a public narrative who\nmixes so much consideration of manners and particular inclinations: and I\nam of a quite contrary opinion to him, holding that, having especially to\nfollow the lives of the emperors of his time, so various and extreme in\nall sorts of forms, so many notable actions as their cruelty especially\nproduced in their subjects, he had a stronger and more attractive matter\nto treat of than if he had had to describe battles and universal\ncommotions; so that I often find him sterile, running over those brave\ndeaths as if he feared to trouble us with their multitude and length.\nThis form of history is by much the most useful; public movements depend\nmost upon the conduct of fortune, private ones upon our own.  \u2018Tis rather\na judgment than a narration of history; there are in it more precepts\nthan stories: it is not a book to read, \u2018tis a book to study and learn;\n\u2018tis full of sententious opinions, right or wrong; \u2018tis a nursery of\nethic and politic discourses, for the use and ornament of those who have\nany place in the government of the world.  He always argues by strong and\nsolid reasons, after a pointed and subtle manner, according to the\naffected style of that age, which was so in love with an inflated manner,\nthat where point and subtlety were wanting in things it supplied these\nwith lofty and swelling words.  \u2018Tis not much unlike the style of Seneca:\nI look upon Tacitus as more sinewy, and Seneca as more sharp.  His pen\nseems most proper for a troubled and sick state, as ours at present is;\nyou would often say that he paints and pinches us.\n\nThey who doubt his good faith sufficiently accuse themselves of being his\nenemy upon some other account.  His opinions are sound, and lean to the\nright side in the Roman affairs.  And yet I am angry at him for judging\nmore severely of Pompey than consists with the opinion of those worthy\nmen who lived in the same time, and had dealings with him; and to have\nreputed him on a par with Marius and Sylla, excepting that he was more\nclose.  Other writers have not acquitted his intention in the government\nof affairs from ambition and revenge; and even his friends were afraid\nthat victory would have transported him beyond the bounds of reason, but\nnot to so immeasurable a degree as theirs; nothing in his life threatened\nsuch express cruelty and tyranny.  Neither ought we to set suspicion\nagainst evidence; and therefore I do not believe Plutarch in this matter.\nThat his narrations were genuine and straightforward may, perhaps, be\nargued from this very thing, that they do not always apply to the\nconclusions of his judgments, which he follows according to the bias he\nhas taken, very often beyond the matter he presents us withal, which he\nhas not deigned to alter in the least degree.  He needs no excuse for\nhaving approved the religion of his time, according as the laws enjoined,\nand to have been ignorant of the true; this was his misfortune, not his\nfault.\n\nI have principally considered his judgment, and am not very well\nsatisfied therewith throughout; as these words in the letter that\nTiberius, old and sick, sent to the senate. \u201cWhat shall I write to you,\nsirs, or how should I write to you, or what should I not write to you at\nthis time?  May the gods and goddesses lay a worse punishment upon me\nthan I am every day tormented with, if I know!\u201d  I do not see why he\nshould so positively apply them to a sharp remorse that tormented the\nconscience of Tiberius; at least, when I was in the same condition, I\nperceived no such thing.\n\nAnd this also seemed to me a little mean in him that, having to say that\nhe had borne an honourable office in Rome, he excuses himself that he\ndoes not say it out of ostentation; this seems, I say, mean for such a\nsoul as his; for not to speak roundly of a man\u2019s self implies some want\nof courage; a man of solid and lofty judgment, who judges soundly and\nsurely, makes use of his own example upon all occasions, as well as those\nof others; and gives evidence as freely of himself as of a third person.\nWe are to pass by these common rules of civility, in favour of truth and\nliberty.  I dare not only speak of myself, but to speak only of myself:\nwhen I write of anything else, I miss my way and wander from my subject.\nI am not so indiscreetly enamoured of myself, so wholly mixed up with,\nand bound to myself, that I cannot distinguish and consider myself apart,\nas I do a neighbour or a tree: \u2018tis equally a fault not to discern how\nfar a man\u2019s worth extends, and to say more than a man discovers in\nhimself.  We owe more love to God than to ourselves, and know Him less;\nand yet speak of Him as much as we will.\n\nIf the writings of Tacitus indicate anything true of his qualities, he\nwas a great personage, upright and bold, not of a superstitious but of a\nphilosophical and generous virtue.  One may think him bold in his\nrelations; as where he tells us, that a soldier carrying a burden of\nwood, his hands were so frozen and so stuck to the load that they there\nremained closed and dead, being severed from his arms.  I always in such\nthings bow to the authority of so great witnesses.\n\nWhat also he says, that Vespasian, \u201cby the favour of the god Serapis,\ncured a blind woman at Alexandria by anointing her eyes with his spittle,\nand I know not what other miracle,\u201d he says by the example and duty of\nall his good historians.  They record all events of importance; and\namongst public incidents are the popular rumours and opinions.  \u2018Tis\ntheir part to relate common beliefs, not to regulate them: that part\nconcerns divines and philosophers, directors of consciences; and\ntherefore it was that this companion of his, and a great man like\nhimself, very wisely said:\n\n     \u201cEquidem plura transcribo, quam credo: nam nec affirmare\n     sustineo, de quibus dubito, nec subducere quae accepi;\u201d\n\n     [\u201cTruly, I set down more things than I believe, for I can neither\n     affirm things whereof I doubt, nor suppress what I have heard.\u201d\n      --Quintus Curtius, ix.]\n\nand this other:\n\n               \u201cHaec neque affirmare neque refellere operae\n               pretium est; famae rerum standum est.\u201d\n\n     [\u201c\u2018Tis neither worth the while to affirm or to refute these things;\n     we must stand to report\u201d--Livy, i., Praef., and viii. 6.]\n\nAnd writing in an age wherein the belief of prodigies began to decline,\nhe says he would not, nevertheless, forbear to insert in his Annals, and\nto give a relation of things received by so many worthy men, and with so\ngreat reverence of antiquity; \u2018tis very well said.  Let them deliver to\nus history, more as they receive it than as they believe it.  I, who am\nmonarch of the matter whereof I treat, and who am accountable to none, do\nnot, nevertheless, always believe myself; I often hazard sallies of my\nown wit, wherein I very much suspect myself, and certain verbal quibbles,\nat which I shake my ears; but I let them go at a venture.  I see that\nothers get reputation by such things: \u2018tis not for me alone to judge.  I\npresent myself standing and lying, before and behind, my right side and\nmy left, and, in all my natural postures.  Wits, though equal in force,\nare not always equal in taste and application.\n\nThis is what my memory presents to me in gross, and with uncertainty\nenough; all judgments in gross are weak and imperfect.\n\n\n\n\n     ETEXT EDITOR\u2019S BOOKMARKS:\n\n     A hundred more escape us than ever come to our knowledge\n     A man must have courage to fear\n     A man never speaks of himself without loss\n     A man\u2019s accusations of himself are always believed\n     Agitation has usurped the place of reason\n     All judgments in gross are weak and imperfect\n     Any argument if it  be carried on with method\n     Apprenticeships that are to be served beforehand\n     Arrogant ignorance\n     Avoid all magnificences that will in a short time be forgotten\n     Being as impatient of commanding as of being commanded\n     Defer my revenge to another and better time\n     Desires, that still increase as they are fulfilled\n     Detest in others the defects which are more manifest in us\n     Disdainful, contemplative, serious and grave as the ass\n     Do not, nevertheless, always believe myself\n     Events are a very poor testimony of our worth and parts.\n     Every abridgment of a good book is a foolish abridgment\n     Fault not to discern how far a man\u2019s worth extends\n     Folly and absurdity are not to be cured by bare admonition\n     Folly satisfied with itself than any reason can reasonably be\n     Folly than to be moved and angry at the follies of the world\n     Give us history, more as they receive it than as they believe it\n     I every day hear fools say things that are not foolish\n     I hail and caress truth in what quarter soever I find it\n     I hate all sorts of tyranny, both in word and deed\n     I love stout expressions amongst gentle men\n     I was too frightened to be ill\n     If it be the writer\u2019s wit or borrowed from some other\n     Ignorance does not offend me, but the foppery of it.\n     It is not a book to read, \u2018tis a book to study and learn\n     \u201cIt was what I was about to say; it was just my idea,\u201d\n      Judge by justice, and choose men by reason\n     Knock you down with the authority of their experience\n     Learning improves fortunes enough, but not minds\n     Liberality at the expense of others\n     Malice must be employed to correct this arrogant ignorance\n     Man must have a care not to do his master so great service\n     Mix railing, indiscretion, and fury in his disputations\n     Most men are rich in borrowed sufficiency\n     My humour is unfit either to speak or write for beginners\n     My reason is not obliged to bow and bend; my knees are\n     Never oppose them either by word or sign, how false or absurd\n     New World: sold it opinions and our arts at a very dear rate\n     Obstinancy and heat in argument are the surest proofs of folly\n     One must first know what is his own and what is not\n     Our knowledge, which is a wretched foundation\n     Passion has already confounded his judgment\n     Pinch the secret strings of our imperfections\n     Practical Jokes: Tis unhandsome to fight in play\n     Presumptive knowledge by silence\n     Silent mien procured the credit of prudence and capacity\n     Spectators can claim no interest in the honour and pleasure\n     Study of books is a languishing and feeble motion\n     The cause of truth ought to be the common cause\n     The event often justifies a very foolish conduct\n     The ignorant return from the combat full of joy and triumph\n     The very name Liberality sounds of Liberty.\n     There are some upon whom their rich clothes weep\n     There is no merchant that always gains\n     There is nothing single and rare in respect of nature\n     They have heard, they have seen, they have done so and so\n     They have not the courage to suffer themselves to be corrected\n     Tis impossible to deal fairly with a fool\n     To fret and vex at folly, as I do, is folly itself\n     Transferring of money from the right owners to strangers\n     Tutor to the ignorance and folly of the first we meet\n     Tyrannic sourness not to endure a form contrary to one\u2019s own\n     Universal judgments that I see so common, signify nothing\n     \u201cWhat he laughed at, being alone?\u201d--\u201cThat I do laugh alone,\u201d\n      We are not to judge of counsels by events\n     We do not correct the man we hang; we correct others by him\n     We neither see far forward nor far backward\n     Whilst thou wast silent, thou seemedst to be some great thing\n     Who has once been a very fool, will never after be very wise\n     Wide of the mark in judging of their own works\n     Wise may learn more of fools, than fools can of the wise\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nESSAYS OF MICHEL DE MONTAIGNE\n\nTranslated by Charles Cotton\n\nEdited by William Carew Hazlitt\n\n1877\n\n\n\n\nCONTENTS OF VOLUME 17.\n\nIX.   Of Vanity\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nOF VANITY\n\nThere is, peradventure, no more manifest vanity than to write of it so\nvainly.  That which divinity has so divinely expressed to us--[\u201cVanity\nof vanities: all is vanity.\u201d--Eccles., i. 2.]--ought to be carefully and\ncontinually meditated by men of understanding.  Who does not see that I\nhave taken a road, in which, incessantly and without labour, I shall\nproceed so long as there shall be ink and paper in the world?  I can give\nno account of my life by my actions; fortune has placed them too low: I\nmust do it by my fancies.  And yet I have seen a gentleman who only\ncommunicated his life by the workings of his belly: you might see on his\npremises a show of a row of basins of seven or eight days\u2019 standing; it\nwas his study, his discourse; all other talk stank in his nostrils.\nHere, but not so nauseous, are the excrements of an old mind, sometimes\nthick, sometimes thin, and always indigested.  And when shall I have done\nrepresenting the continual agitation and mutation of my thoughts, as they\ncome into my head, seeing that Diomedes wrote six thousand books upon the\nsole subject of grammar?\n\n     [It was not Diomedes, but Didymus the grammarian, who, as Seneca\n     (Ep., 88) tells us, wrote four not six thousand books on questions\n     of vain literature, which was the principal study of the ancient\n     grammarian.--Coste.  But the number is probably exaggerated, and for\n     books we should doubtless read pamphlets or essays.]\n\nWhat, then, ought prating to produce, since prattling and the first\nbeginning to speak, stuffed the world with such a horrible load of\nvolumes?  So many words for words only.  O Pythagoras, why didst not thou\nallay this tempest?  They accused one Galba of old for living idly; he\nmade answer, \u201cThat every one ought to give account of his actions, but\nnot of his home.\u201d  He was mistaken, for justice also takes cognisance of\nthose who glean after the reaper.\n\nBut there should be some restraint of law against foolish and impertinent\nscribblers, as well as against vagabonds and idle persons; which if there\nwere, both I and a hundred others would be banished from the reach of our\npeople.  I do not speak this in jest: scribbling seems to be a symptom of\na disordered and licentious age.  When did we write so much as since our\ntroubles? when the Romans so much, as upon the point of ruin?  Besides\nthat, the refining of wits does not make people wiser in a government:\nthis idle employment springs from this, that every one applies himself\nnegligently to the duty of his vocation, and is easily debauched from it.\nThe corruption of the age is made up by the particular contribution of\nevery individual man; some contribute treachery, others injustice,\nirreligion, tyranny, avarice, cruelty, according to their power; the\nweaker sort contribute folly, vanity, and idleness; of these I am one.\nIt seems as if it were the season for vain things, when the hurtful\noppress us; in a time when doing ill is common, to do but what signifies\nnothing is a kind of commendation.  \u2018Tis my comfort, that I shall be one\nof the last who shall be called in question; and whilst the greater\noffenders are being brought to account, I shall have leisure to amend:\nfor it would, methinks, be against reason to punish little\ninconveniences, whilst we are infested with the greater.  As the\nphysician Philotimus said to one who presented him his finger to dress,\nand who he perceived, both by his complexion and his breath, had an ulcer\nin his lungs: \u201cFriend, it is not now time to play with your nails.\u201d\n --[Plutarch, How we may distinguish a Flatterer from a Friend.]\n\nAnd yet I saw, some years ago, a person, whose name and memory I have in\nvery great esteem, in the very height of our great disorders, when there\nwas neither law nor justice, nor magistrate who performed his office, no\nmore than there is now, publish I know not what pitiful reformations\nabout cloths, cookery, and law chicanery.  Those are amusements wherewith\nto feed a people that are ill-used, to show that they are not totally\nforgotten.  Those others do the same, who insist upon prohibiting\nparticular ways of speaking, dances, and games, to a people totally\nabandoned to all sorts of execrable vices.  \u2018Tis no time to bathe and\ncleanse one\u2019s self, when one is seized by a violent fever; it was for the\nSpartans alone to fall to combing and curling themselves, when they were\njust upon the point of running headlong into some extreme danger of their\nlife.\n\nFor my part, I have that worse custom, that if my slipper go awry, I let\nmy shirt and my cloak do so too; I scorn to mend myself by halves.\n\nWhen I am in a bad plight, I fasten upon the mischief; I abandon myself\nthrough despair; I let myself go towards the precipice, and, as they say,\n\u201cthrow the helve after the hatchet\u201d; I am obstinate in growing worse, and\nthink myself no longer worth my own care; I am either well or ill\nthroughout.  \u2018T is a favour to me, that the desolation of this kingdom\nfalls out in the desolation of my age: I better suffer that my ill be\nmultiplied, than if my well had been disturbed.--[That, being ill, I\nshould grow worse, than that, being well, I should grow ill.]--The words\nI utter in mishap are words of anger: my courage sets up its bristles,\ninstead of letting them down; and, contrary to others, I am more devout\nin good than in evil fortune, according to the precept of Xenophon, if\nnot according to his reason; and am more ready to turn up my eyes to\nheaven to return thanks, than to crave.  I am more solicitous to improve\nmy health, when I am well, than to restore it when I am sick;\nprosperities are the same discipline and instruction to me that\nadversities and rods are to others.  As if good fortune were a thing\ninconsistent with good conscience, men never grow good but in evil\nfortune.  Good fortune is to me a singular spur to modesty and\nmoderation: an entreaty wins, a threat checks me; favour makes me bend,\nfear stiffens me.\n\nAmongst human conditions this is common enough: to be better pleased with\nforeign things than with our own, and to love innovation and change:\n\n              \u201cIpsa dies ideo nos grato perluit haustu,\n               Quod permutatis hora recurrit equis:\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThe light of day itself shines more pleasantly upon us because it\n     changes its horses every hour.\u201d  Spoke of a water hour-glass,\n     adds  Cotton.]\n\nI have my share.  Those who follow the other extreme, of being quite\nsatisfied and pleased with and in themselves, of valuing what they have\nabove all the rest, and of concluding no beauty can be greater than what\nthey see, if they are not wiser than we, are really more happy; I do not\nenvy their wisdom, but their good fortune.\n\nThis greedy humour of new and unknown things helps to nourish in me the\ndesire of travel; but a great many more circumstances contribute to it;\nI am very willing to quit the government of my house.  There is, I\nconfess, a kind of convenience in commanding, though it were but in a\nbarn, and in being obeyed by one\u2019s people; but \u2018tis too uniform and\nlanguid a pleasure, and is, moreover, of necessity mixed with a thousand\nvexatious thoughts: one while the poverty and the oppression of your\ntenants: another, quarrels amongst neighbours: another, the trespasses\nthey make upon you afflict you;\n\n                   \u201cAut verberatae grandine vineae,\n                    Fundusque mendax, arbore nunc aquas\n                    Culpante, nunc torrentia agros\n                    Sidera, nunc hyemes iniquas.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cOr hail-smitten vines and the deceptive farm; now trees damaged\n     by the rains, or years of dearth, now summer\u2019s heat burning up the\n     petals, now destructive winters.\u201d--Horatius, Od., iii. I, 29.]\n\nand that God scarce in six months sends a season wherein your bailiff can\ndo his business as he should; but that if it serves the vines, it spoils\nthe meadows:\n\n              \u201cAut nimiis torret fervoribus aetherius sol,\n               Aut subiti perimunt imbres, gelidoeque pruinae,\n               Flabraque ventorum violento turbine vexant;\u201d\n\n     [\u201cEither the scorching sun burns up your fields, or sudden rains or\n     frosts destroy your harvests, or a violent wind carries away all\n     before it.\u201d--Lucretius, V. 216.]\n\nto which may be added the new and neat-made shoe of the man of old, that\nhurts your foot,\n\n     [Leclerc maliciously suggests that this is a sly hit at Montaigne\u2019s\n     wife, the man of old being the person mentioned in Plutarch\u2019s Life\n     of Paulus Emilius, c. 3, who, when his friends reproached him for\n     repudiating his wife, whose various merits they extolled, pointed to\n     his shoe, and said, \u201cThat looks a nice well-made shoe to you; but I\n     alone know where it pinches.\u201d]\n\nand that a stranger does not understand how much it costs you, and what\nyou contribute to maintain that show of order that is seen in your\nfamily, and that peradventure you buy too dear.\n\nI came late to the government of a house: they whom nature sent into the\nworld before me long eased me of that trouble; so that I had already\ntaken another bent more suitable to my humour.  Yet, for so much as I\nhave seen, \u2018tis an employment more troublesome than hard; whoever is\ncapable of anything else, will easily do this.  Had I a mind to be rich,\nthat way would seem too long; I had served my kings, a more profitable\ntraffic than any other.  Since I pretend to nothing but the reputation of\nhaving got nothing or dissipated nothing, conformably to the rest of my\nlife, improper either to do good or ill of any moment, and that I only\ndesire to pass on, I can do it, thanks be to God, without any great\nendeavour.  At the worst, evermore prevent poverty by lessening your\nexpense; \u2018tis that which I make my great concern, and doubt not but to do\nit before I shall be compelled.  As to the rest, I have sufficiently\nsettled my thoughts to live upon less than I have, and live contentedly:\n\n          \u201cNon aestimatione census, verum victu atque cultu,\n          terminantur pecunix modus.\u201d\n\n     [\u201c\u2018Tis not by the value of possessions, but by our daily subsistence\n     and tillage, that our riches are truly estimated.\u201d\n      --Cicero, Paradox, vi. 3.]\n\nMy real need does not so wholly take up all I have, that Fortune has not\nwhereon to fasten her teeth without biting to the quick.  My presence,\nheedless and ignorant as it is, does me great service in my domestic\naffairs; I employ myself in them, but it goes against the hair, finding\nthat I have this in my house, that though I burn my candle at one end by\nmyself, the other is not spared.\n\nJourneys do me no harm but only by their expense, which is great, and\nmore than I am well able to bear, being always wont to travel with not\nonly a necessary, but a handsome equipage; I must make them so much\nshorter and fewer; I spend therein but the froth, and what I have\nreserved for such uses, delaying and deferring my motion till that be\nready.  I will not that the pleasure of going abroad spoil the pleasure\nof being retired at home; on the contrary, I intend they shall nourish\nand favour one another.  Fortune has assisted me in this, that since my\nprincipal profession in this life was to live at ease, and rather idly\nthan busily, she has deprived me of the necessity of growing rich to\nprovide for the multitude of my heirs.  If there be not enough for one,\nof that whereof I had so plentifully enough, at his peril be it: his\nimprudence will not deserve that I should wish him any more.  And every\none, according to the example of Phocion, provides sufficiently for his\nchildren who so provides for them as to leave them as much as was left\nhim.  I should by no means like Crates\u2019 way.  He left his money in the\nhands of a banker with this condition--that if his children were fools,\nhe should then give it to them; if wise, he should then distribute it to\nthe most foolish of the people; as if fools, for being less capable of\nliving without riches, were more capable of using them.\n\nAt all events, the damage occasioned by my absence seems not to deserve,\nso long as I am able to support it, that I should waive the occasions of\ndiverting myself by that troublesome assistance.\n\nThere is always something that goes amiss.  The affairs, one while of one\nhouse, and then of another, tear you to pieces; you pry into everything\ntoo near; your perspicacity hurts you here, as well as in other things.\nI steal away from occasions of vexing myself, and turn from the knowledge\nof things that go amiss; and yet I cannot so order it, but that every\nhour I jostle against something or other that displeases me; and the\ntricks that they most conceal from me, are those that I the soonest come\nto know; some there are that, not to make matters worse, a man must\nhimself help to conceal.  Vain vexations; vain sometimes, but always\nvexations.  The smallest and slightest impediments are the most piercing:\nand as little letters most tire the eyes, so do little affairs most\ndisturb us.  The rout of little ills more offend than one, how great\nsoever.  By how much domestic thorns are numerous and slight, by so much\nthey prick deeper and without warning, easily surprising us when least we\nsuspect them.\n\n     [Now Homer shews us clearly enough how surprise gives the advantage;\n     who represents Ulysses weeping at the death of his dog; and not\n     weeping at the tears of his mother; the first accident, trivial as\n     it was, got the better of him, coming upon him quite unexpectedly;\n     he sustained the second, though more potent, because he was prepared\n     for it.  \u2018Tis light occasions that humble our lives. ]\n\nI am no philosopher; evils oppress me according to their weight, and they\nweigh as much according to the form as the matter, and very often more.\nIf I have therein more perspicacity than the vulgar, I have also more\npatience; in short, they weigh with me, if they do not hurt me.  Life is\na tender thing, and easily molested.  Since my age has made me grow more\npensive and morose,\n\n          \u201cNemo enim resistit sibi, cum caeperit impelli,\u201d\n\n     [\u201cFor no man resists himself when he has begun to be driven\n     forward.\u201d--Seneca, Ep., 13.]\n\nfor the most trivial cause imaginable, I irritate that humour, which\nafterwards nourishes and exasperates itself of its own motion; attracting\nand heaping up matter upon matter whereon to feed:\n\n               \u201cStillicidi casus lapidem cavat:\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThe ever falling drop hollows out a stone.\u201d--Lucretius, i. 314.]\n\nthese continual tricklings consume and ulcerate me.  Ordinary\ninconveniences are never light; they are continual and inseparable,\nespecially when they spring from the members of a family, continual and\ninseparable.  When I consider my affairs at distance and in gross, I\nfind, because perhaps my memory is none of the best, that they have gone\non hitherto improving beyond my reason or expectation; my revenue seems\ngreater than it is; its prosperity betrays me: but when I pry more\nnarrowly into the business, and see how all things go:\n\n               \u201cTum vero in curas animum diducimus omnes;\u201d\n\n          [\u201cIndeed we lead the mind into all sorts of cares.\u201d\n           --AEneid, v. 720.]\n\nI have a thousand things to desire and to fear.  To give them quite over,\nis very easy for me to do: but to look after them without trouble, is\nvery hard.  \u2018Tis a miserable thing to be in a place where everything you\nsee employs and concerns you; and I fancy that I more cheerfully enjoy\nthe pleasures of another man\u2019s house, and with greater and a purer\nrelish, than those of my own.  Diogenes answered according to my humour\nhim who asked him what sort of wine he liked the best: \u201cThat of another,\u201d\n said he.--[Diogenes Laertius, vi. 54.]\n\nMy father took a delight in building at Montaigne, where he was born; and\nin all the government of domestic affairs I love to follow his example\nand rules, and I shall engage those who are to succeed me, as much as in\nme lies, to do the same.  Could I do better for him, I would; and am\nproud that his will is still performing and acting by me.  God forbid\nthat in my hands I should ever suffer any image of life, that I am able\nto render to so good a father, to fail.  And wherever I have taken in\nhand to strengthen some old foundations of walls, and to repair some\nruinous buildings, in earnest I have done it more out of respect to his\ndesign, than my own satisfaction; and am angry at myself that I have not\nproceeded further to finish the beginnings he left in his house, and so\nmuch the more because I am very likely to be the last possessor of my\nrace, and to give the last hand to it.  For, as to my own particular\napplication, neither the pleasure of building, which they say is so\nbewitching, nor hunting, nor gardens, nor the other pleasures of a\nretired life, can much amuse me.  And \u2018tis what I am angry at myself for,\nas I am for all other opinions that are incommodious to me; which I would\nnot so much care to have vigorous and learned, as I would have them easy\nand convenient for life, they are true and sound enough, if they are\nuseful and pleasing.  Such as hear me declare my ignorance in husbandry,\nwhisper in my ear that it is disdain, and that I neglect to know its\ninstruments, its seasons, its order, how they dress my vines, how they\ngraft, and to know the names and forms of herbs and fruits, and the\npreparing the meat on which I live, the names and prices of the stuffs I\nwear, because, say they; I have set my heart upon some higher knowledge;\nthey kill me in saying so.  It is not disdain; it is folly, and rather\nstupidity than glory; I had rather be a good horseman than a good\nlogician:\n\n         \u201cQuin to aliquid saltem potius, quorum indiget usus,\n          Viminibus mollique paras detexere junco.\u201d\n\n     [\u201c\u2018Dost thou not rather do something which is required, and make\n     osier and reed basket.\u201d--Virgil, Eclog., ii. 71.]\n\nWe occupy our thoughts about the general, and about universal causes and\nconducts, which will very well carry on themselves without our care; and\nleave our own business at random, and Michael much more our concern than\nman.  Now I am, indeed, for the most part at home; but I would be there\nbetter pleased than anywhere else:\n\n                   \u201cSit meae sedes utinam senectae,\n                    Sit modus lasso maris, et viarum,\n                    Militiaeque.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cLet my old age have a fixed seat; let there be a limit to fatigues\n     from the sea, journeys, warfare.\u201d--Horace, Od., ii. 6, 6.]\n\nI know not whether or no I shall bring it about.  I could wish that,\ninstead of some other member of his succession, my father had resigned to\nme the passionate affection he had in his old age to his household\naffairs; he was happy in that he could accommodate his desires to his\nfortune, and satisfy himself with what he had; political philosophy may\nto much purpose condemn the meanness and sterility of my employment, if I\ncan once come to relish it, as he did.  I am of opinion that the most\nhonourable calling is to serve the public, and to be useful to many,\n\n     \u201cFructus enim ingenii et virtutis, omnisque praestantiae,\n     tum maximus capitur, quum in proximum quemque confertur:\u201d\n\n     [\u201cFor the greatest enjoyment of evil and virtue, and of all\n     excellence, is experienced when they are conferred on some one\n     nearest.\u201d--Cicero, De Amicil., c.]\n\nfor myself, I disclaim it; partly out of conscience (for where I see the\nweight that lies upon such employments, I perceive also the little means\nI have to supply it; and Plato, a master in all political government\nhimself, nevertheless took care to abstain from it), and partly out of\ncowardice.  I content myself with enjoying the world without bustle;\nonly-to live an excusable life, and such as may neither be a burden to\nmyself nor to any other.\n\nNever did any man more fully and feebly suffer himself to be governed by\na third person than I should do, had I any one to whom to entrust myself.\nOne of my wishes at this time should be, to have a son-in-law that knew\nhandsomely how to cherish my old age, and to rock it asleep; into whose\nhands I might deposit, in full sovereignty, the management and use of all\nmy goods, that he might dispose of them as I do, and get by them what I\nget, provided that he on his part were truly acknowledging, and a friend.\nBut we live in a world where loyalty of one\u2019s own children is unknown.\n\nHe who has the charge of my purse in his travels, has it purely and\nwithout control; he could cheat me thoroughly, if he came to reckoning;\nand, if he is not a devil, I oblige him to deal faithfully with me by so\nentire a trust:\n\n          \u201cMulti fallere do cuerunt, dum timent falli;\n          et aliis jus peccandi suspicando fecerunt.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cMany have taught others to deceive, while they fear to be\n     deceived, and, by suspecting them, have given them a title to do\n     ill.\u201d--Seneca, Epist., 3.]\n\nThe most common security I take of my people is ignorance; I never\npresume any to be vicious till I have first found them so; and repose the\nmost confidence in the younger sort, that I think are least spoiled by\nill example.  I had rather be told at two months\u2019 end that I have spent\nfour hundred crowns, than to have my ears battered every night with\nthree, five, seven: and I have been, in this way, as little robbed as\nanother.  It is true, I am willing enough not to see it; I, in some sort,\npurposely, harbour a kind of perplexed, uncertain knowledge of my money:\nup to a certain point, I am content to doubt.  One must leave a little\nroom for the infidelity or indiscretion of a servant; if you have left\nenough, in gross, to do your business, let the overplus of Fortune\u2019s\nliberality run a little more freely at her mercy; \u2018tis the gleaner\u2019s\nportion.  After all, I do not so much value the fidelity of my people as\nI contemn their injury.  What a mean and ridiculous thing it is for a man\nto study his money, to delight in handling and telling it over and over\nagain!  \u2018Tis by this avarice makes its approaches.\n\nIn eighteen years that I have had my estate in my, own hands, I could\nnever prevail with myself either to read over my deeds or examine my\nprincipal affairs, which ought, of necessity, to pass under my knowledge\nand inspection.  \u2018Tis not a philosophical disdain of worldly and\ntransitory things; my taste is not purified to that degree, and I value\nthem at as great a rate, at least, as they are worth; but \u2018tis, in truth,\nan inexcusable and childish laziness and negligence.  What would I not\nrather do than read a contract?  or than, as a slave to my own business,\ntumble over those dusty writings?  or, which is worse, those of another\nman, as so many do nowadays, to get money?  I grudge nothing but care and\ntrouble, and endeavour nothing so much, as to be careless and at ease.\nI had been much fitter, I believe, could it have been without obligation\nand servitude, to have lived upon another man\u2019s fortune than my own: and,\nindeed, I do not know, when I examine it nearer, whether, according to my\nhumour, what I have to suffer from my affairs and servants, has not in it\nsomething more abject, troublesome, and tormenting than there would be in\nserving a man better born than myself, who would govern me with a gentle\nrein, and a little at my own case:\n\n          \u201cServitus obedientia est fracti animi et abjecti,\n          arbitrio carentis suo.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cServitude is the obedience of a subdued and abject mind, wanting\n     its own free will.\u201d--Cicero, Paradox, V. I.]\n\nCrates did worse, who threw himself into the liberty of poverty, only to\nrid himself of the inconveniences and cares of his house.  This is what I\nwould not do; I hate poverty equally with pain; but I could be content to\nchange the kind of life I live for another that was humbler and less\nchargeable.\n\nWhen absent from home, I divest myself of all these thoughts, and should\nbe less concerned for the ruin of a tower, than I am, when present, at\nthe fall of a tile.  My mind is easily composed at distance, but suffers\nas much as that of the meanest peasant when I am at home; the reins of my\nbridle being wrongly put on, or a strap flapping against my leg, will\nkeep me out of humour a day together.  I raise my courage, well enough\nagainst inconveniences: lift up my eyes I cannot:\n\n                    \u201cSensus, o superi, sensus.\u201d\n\n               [\u201cThe senses, O ye gods, the senses.\u201d]\n\nI am at home responsible for whatever goes amiss.  Few masters (I speak\nof those of medium condition such as mine), and if there be any such,\nthey are more happy, can rely so much upon another, but that the greatest\npart of the burden will lie upon their own shoulders.  This takes much\nfrom my grace in entertaining visitors, so that I have, peradventure,\ndetained some rather out of expectation of a good dinner, than by my own\nbehaviour; and lose much of the pleasure I ought to reap at my own house\nfrom the visitation and assembling of my friends.  The most ridiculous\ncarriage of a gentleman in his own house, is to see him bustling about\nthe business of the place, whispering one servant, and looking an angry\nlook at another: it ought insensibly to slide along, and to represent an\nordinary current; and I think it unhandsome to talk much to our guests of\ntheir entertainment, whether by way of bragging or excuse.  I love order\nand cleanliness--\n\n                         \u201cEt cantharus et lanx\n                         Ostendunt mihi me\u201d--\n\n          [\u201cThe dishes and the glasses shew me my own reflection.\u201d\n           --Horace, Ep., i. 5, 23]\n\nmore than abundance; and at home have an exact regard to necessity,\nlittle to outward show.  If a footman falls to cuffs at another man\u2019s\nhouse, or stumble and throw a dish before him as he is carrying it up,\nyou only laugh and make a jest on\u2019t; you sleep whilst the master of the\nhouse is arranging a bill of fare with his steward for your morrow\u2019s\nentertainment.  I speak according as I do myself; quite appreciating,\nnevertheless, good husbandry in general, and how pleasant quiet and\nprosperous household management, carried regularly on, is to some\nnatures; and not wishing to fasten my own errors and inconveniences to\nthe thing; nor to give Plato the lie, who looks upon it as the most\npleasant employment to every one to do his particular affairs without\nwrong to another.\n\nWhen I travel I have nothing to care for but myself, and the laying out\nmy money; which is disposed of by one single precept; too many things are\nrequired to the raking it together; in that I understand nothing; in\nspending, I understand a little, and how to give some show to my expense,\nwhich is indeed its principal use; but I rely too ambitiously upon it,\nwhich renders it unequal and difform, and, moreover, immoderate in both\nthe one and the other aspect; if it makes a show, if it serve the turn,\nI indiscreetly let it run; and as indiscreetly tie up my purse-strings,\nif it does not shine, and does not please me.  Whatever it be, whether\nart or nature, that imprints in us the condition of living by reference\nto others, it does us much more harm than good; we deprive ourselves of\nour own utilities, to accommodate appearances to the common opinion:\nwe care not so much what our being is, as to us and in reality, as what\nit is to the public observation.  Even the properties of the mind, and\nwisdom itself, seem fruitless to us, if only enjoyed by ourselves, and if\nit produce not itself to the view and approbation of others.  There is a\nsort of men whose gold runs in streams underground imperceptibly; others\nexpose it all in plates and branches; so that to the one a liard is worth\na crown, and to the others the inverse: the world esteeming its use and\nvalue, according to the show.  All over-nice solicitude about riches\nsmells of avarice: even the very disposing of it, with a too systematic\nand artificial liberality, is not worth a painful superintendence and\nsolicitude: he, that will order his expense to just so much, makes it too\npinched and narrow.  The keeping or spending are, of themselves,\nindifferent things, and receive no colour of good or ill, but according\nto the application of the will.\n\nThe other cause that tempts me out to these journeys is, inaptitude for\nthe present manners in our state.  I could easily console myself for this\ncorruption in regard to the public interest:\n\n              \u201cPejoraque saecula ferri\n               Temporibus, quorum sceleri non invenit ipsa\n               Nomen, et a nullo posuit natura metallo;\u201d\n\n     [\u201cAnd, worse than the iron ages, for whose crimes there is no\n     similitude in any of Nature\u2019s metals.\u201d--Juvenal, xiii. 28.]\n\nbut not to my own.  I am, in particular, too much oppressed by them: for,\nin my neighbourhood, we are, of late, by the long licence of our civil\nwars, grown old in so riotous a form of state,\n\n               \u201cQuippe ubi fas versum atque nefas,\u201d\n\n          [\u201cWhere wrong and right have changed places.\u201d\n           --Virgil, Georg., i. 504.]\n\nthat in earnest, \u2018tis a wonder how it can subsist:\n\n          \u201cArmati terram exercent, semperque recentes\n          Convectare juvat praedas; et vivere rapto.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cMen plough, girt with arms; ever delighting in fresh robberies,\n     and living by rapine.\u201d--AEneid, vii. 748.]\n\nIn fine, I see by our example, that the society of men is maintained and\nheld together, at what price soever; in what condition soever they are\nplaced, they still close and stick together, both moving and in heaps; as\nill united bodies, that, shuffled together without order, find of\nthemselves a means to unite and settle, often better than they could have\nbeen disposed by art.  King Philip mustered up a rabble of the most\nwicked and incorrigible rascals he could pick out, and put them all\ntogether into a city he had caused to be built for that purpose, which\nbore their name: I believe that they, even from vices themselves, erected\na government amongst them, and a commodious and just society.  I see, not\none action, or three, or a hundred, but manners, in common and received\nuse, so ferocious, especially in inhumanity and treachery, which are to\nme the worst of all vices, that I have not the heart to think of them\nwithout horror; and almost as much admire as I detest them: the exercise\nof these signal villainies carries with it as great signs of vigour and\nforce of soul, as of error and disorder.  Necessity reconciles and brings\nmen together; and this accidental connection afterwards forms itself into\nlaws: for there have been such, as savage as any human opinion could\nconceive, who, nevertheless, have maintained their body with as much\nhealth and length of life as any Plato or Aristotle could invent.  And\ncertainly, all these descriptions of polities, feigned by art, are found\nto be ridiculous and unfit to be put in practice.\n\nThese great and tedious debates about the best form of society, and the\nmost commodious rules to bind us, are debates only proper for the\nexercise of our wits; as in the arts there are several subjects which\nhave their being in agitation and controversy, and have no life but\nthere.  Such an idea of government might be of some value in a new world;\nbut we take a world already made, and formed to certain customs; we do\nnot beget it, as Pyrrha or Cadmus did.  By what means soever we may have\nthe privilege to redress and reform it anew, we can hardly writhe it from\nits wonted bent, but we shall break all.  Solon being asked whether he\nhad established the best laws he could for the Athenians; \u201cYes,\u201d said he,\n\u201cof those they would have received.\u201d  Varro excuses himself after the\nsame manner: \u201cthat if he were to begin to write of religion, he would say\nwhat he believed; but seeing it was already received, he would write\nrather according to use than nature.\u201d\n\nNot according to opinion, but in truth and reality, the best and most\nexcellent government for every nation is that under which it is\nmaintained: its form and essential convenience depend upon custom.\nWe are apt to be displeased at the present condition; but I,\nnevertheless, maintain that to desire command in a few--[an oligarchy.]--\nin a republic, or another sort of government in monarchy than that\nalready established, is both vice and folly:\n\n              \u201cAyme l\u2019estat, tel que to le veois estre\n               S\u2019il est royal ayme la royaute;\n               S\u2019il est de peu, ou biers communaute,\n               Ayme l\u2019aussi; car Dieu t\u2019y a faict naistre.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cLove the government, such as you see it to be.  If it be royal,\n     love royalty; if it is a republic of any sort, still love it; for\n     God himself created thee therein.\u201d]\n\nSo wrote the good Monsieur de Pibrac, whom we have lately lost, a man of\nso excellent a wit, such sound opinions, and such gentle manners.  This\nloss, and that at the same time we have had of Monsieur de Foix, are of\nso great importance to the crown, that I do not know whether there is\nanother couple in France worthy to supply the places of these two Gascons\nin sincerity and wisdom in the council of our kings.  They were both\nvariously great men, and certainly, according to the age, rare and great,\neach of them in his kind: but what destiny was it that placed them in\nthese times, men so remote from and so disproportioned to our corruption\nand intestine tumults?\n\nNothing presses so hard upon a state as innovation: change only gives\nform to injustice and tyranny.  When any piece is loosened, it may be\nproper to stay it; one may take care that the alteration and corruption\nnatural to all things do not carry us too far from our beginnings and\nprinciples: but to undertake to found so great a mass anew, and to change\nthe foundations of so vast a building, is for them to do, who to make\nclean, efface; who reform particular defects by an universal confusion,\nand cure diseases by death:\n\n      \u201cNon tam commutandarum quam evertendarum rerum cupidi.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cNot so desirous of changing as of overthrowing things.\u201d\n      --Cicero, De Offic., ii. i.]\n\nThe world is unapt to be cured; and so impatient of anything that presses\nit, that it thinks of nothing but disengaging itself at what price\nsoever.  We see by a thousand examples, that it ordinarily cures itself\nto its cost.  The discharge of a present evil is no cure, if there be not\na general amendment of condition.  The surgeon\u2019s end is not only to cut\naway the dead flesh; that is but the progress of his cure; he has a care,\nover and above, to fill up the wound with better and more natural flesh,\nand to restore the member to its due state.  Whoever only proposes to\nhimself to remove that which offends him, falls short: for good does not\nnecessarily succeed evil; another evil may succeed, and a worse, as it\nhappened to Caesar\u2019s murderers, who brought the republic to such a pass,\nthat they had reason to repent the meddling with the matter.  The same\nhas since happened to several others, even down to our own times: the\nFrench, my contemporaries, know it well enough.  All great mutations\nshake and disorder a state.\n\nWhoever would look direct at a cure, and well consider of it before he\nbegan, would be very willing to withdraw his hands from meddling in it.\nPacuvius Calavius corrected the vice of this proceeding by a notable\nexample.  His fellow-citizens were in mutiny against their magistrates;\nhe being a man of great authority in the city of Capua, found means one\nday to shut up the Senators in the palace; and calling the people\ntogether in the market-place, there told them that the day was now come\nwherein at full liberty they might revenge themselves on the tyrants by\nwhom they had been so long oppressed, and whom he had now, all alone and\nunarmed, at his mercy.  He then advised that they should call these out,\none by one, by lot, and should individually determine as to each, causing\nwhatever should be decreed to be immediately executed; with this proviso,\nthat they should, at the same time, depute some honest man in the place\nof him who was condemned, to the end there might be no vacancy in the\nSenate.  They had no sooner heard the name of one senator but a great cry\nof universal dislike was raised up against him.  \u201cI see,\u201d says Pacuvius,\n\u201cthat we must put him out; he is a wicked fellow; let us look out a good\none in his room.\u201d  Immediately there was a profound silence, every one\nbeing at a stand whom to choose.  But one, more impudent than the rest,\nhaving named his man, there arose yet a greater consent of voices against\nhim, an hundred imperfections being laid to his charge, and as many just\nreasons why he should not stand.  These contradictory humours growing\nhot, it fared worse with the second senator and the third, there being as\nmuch disagreement in the election of the new, as consent in the putting\nout of the old.  In the end, growing weary of this bustle to no purpose,\nthey began, some one way and some another, to steal out of the assembly:\nevery one carrying back this resolution in his mind, that the oldest and\nbest known evil was ever more supportable than one that was, new and\nuntried.\n\nSeeing how miserably we are agitated (for what have we not done!)\n\n              \u201cEheu! cicatricum, et sceleris pudet,\n               Fratrumque: quid nos dura refugimus\n               AEtas?  quid intactum nefasti\n               Liquimus?  Unde manus inventus\n               Metu Deorum continuit?  quibus\n               Pepercit aris.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cAlas! our crimes and our fratricides are a shame to us!  What\n     crime does this bad age shrink from?  What wickedness have we left\n     undone?  What youth is restrained from evil by the fear of the gods?\n     What altar is spared?\u201d--Horace, Od., i.  33, 35]\n\nI do not presently conclude,\n\n                              \u201cIpsa si velit Salus,\n               Servare prorsus non potest hanc familiam;\u201d\n\n     [\u201cIf the goddess Salus herself wish to save this family, she\n     absolutely cannot\u201d--Terence, Adelph., iv. 7, 43.]\n\nwe are not, peradventure, at our last gasp.  The conservation of states\nis a thing that, in all likelihood, surpasses our understanding;--a civil\ngovernment is, as Plato says, a mighty and puissant thing, and hard to be\ndissolved; it often continues against mortal and intestine diseases,\nagainst the injury of unjust laws, against tyranny, the corruption and\nignorance of magistrates, the licence and sedition of the people.  In all\nour fortunes, we compare ourselves to what is above us, and still look\ntowards those who are better: but let us measure ourselves with what is\nbelow us: there is no condition so miserable wherein a man may not find a\nthousand examples that will administer consolation.  \u2018Tis our vice that\nwe more unwillingly look upon what is above, than willingly upon what is\nbelow; and Solon was used to say, that \u201cwhoever would make a heap of all\nthe ills together, there is no one who would not rather choose to bear\naway the ills he has than to come to an equal division with all other men\nfrom that heap, and take his share.\u201d  Our government is, indeed, very\nsick, but there have been others more sick without dying.  The gods play\nat ball with us and bandy us every way:\n\n          \u201cEnimvero Dii nos homines quasi pilas habent.\u201d\n\nThe stars fatally destined the state of Rome for an example of what they\ncould do in this kind: in it are comprised all the forms and adventures\nthat concern a state: all that order or disorder, good or evil fortune,\ncan do.  Who, then, can despair of his condition, seeing the shocks and\ncommotions wherewith Rome was tumbled and tossed, and yet withstood them\nall?  If the extent of dominion be the health of a state (which I by no\nmeans think it is, and Isocrates pleases me when he instructs Nicocles\nnot to envy princes who have large dominions, but those who know how to\npreserve those which have fallen into their hands), that of Rome was\nnever so sound, as when it was most sick.  The worst of her forms was the\nmost fortunate; one can hardly discern any image of government under the\nfirst emperors; it is the most horrible and tumultuous confusion that can\nbe imagined; it endured it, notwithstanding, and therein continued,\npreserving not a monarchy limited within its own bounds, but so many\nnations so differing, so remote, so disaffected, so confusedly commanded,\nand so unjustly conquered:\n\n              \u201cNec gentibus ullis\n               Commodat in populum, terra pelagique potentem,\n               Invidiam fortuna suam.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cFortune never gave it to any nation to satisfy its hatred against\n     the people, masters of the seas and of the earth.\u201d--Lucan, i. 32.]\n\nEverything that totters does not fall.  The contexture of so great a body\nholds by more nails than one; it holds even by its antiquity, like old\nbuildings, from which the foundations are worn away by time, without\nrough-cast or mortar, which yet live and support themselves by their own\nweight:\n\n                   \u201cNec jam validis radicibus haerens,\n                    Pondere tuta suo est.\u201d\n\nMoreover, it is not rightly to go to work, to examine only the flank and\nthe foss, to judge of the security of a place; we must observe which way\napproaches can be made to it, and in what condition the assailant is: few\nvessels sink with their own weight, and without some exterior violence.\nNow, let us everyway cast our eyes; everything about us totters; in all\nthe great states, both of Christendom and elsewhere, that are known to\nus, if you will but look, you will there see evident menace of alteration\nand ruin:\n\n         \u201cEt sua sunt illis incommoda; parque per omnes\n          Tempestas.\u201d\n\n          [\u201cThey all share in the mischief; the tempest rages\n          everywhere.\u201d--AEneid, ii.]\n\nAstrologers may very well, as they do, warn us of great revolutions and\nimminent mutations: their prophecies are present and palpable, they need\nnot go to heaven to foretell this.  There is not only consolation to be\nextracted from this universal combination of ills and menaces, but,\nmoreover, some hopes of the continuation of our state, forasmuch as,\nnaturally, nothing falls where all falls: universal sickness is\nparticular health: conformity is antagonistic to dissolution.  For my\npart, I despair not, and fancy that I discover ways to save us:\n\n                   \u201cDeus haec fortasse benigna\n                    Reducet in sedem vice.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThe deity will perchance by a favourable turn restore us to our\n     former position.\u201d--Horace, Epod., xiii. 7.]\n\nWho knows but that God will have it happen, as in human bodies that purge\nand restore themselves to a better state by long and grievous maladies,\nwhich render them more entire and perfect health than that they took from\nthem?  That which weighs the most with me is, that in reckoning the\nsymptoms of our ill, I see as many natural ones, and that Heaven sends\nus, and properly its own, as of those that our disorder and human\nimprudence contribute to it.  The very stars seem to declare that we have\nalready continued long enough, and beyond the ordinary term.  This also\nafflicts me, that the mischief which nearest threatens us, is not an\nalteration in the entire and solid mass, but its dissipation and\ndivulsion, which is the most extreme of our fears.\n\nI, moreover, fear, in these fantasies of mine, the treachery of my\nmemory, lest, by inadvertence, it should make me write the same thing\ntwice.  I hate to examine myself, and never review, but very unwillingly,\nwhat has once escaped my pen.  I here set down nothing new.  These are\ncommon thoughts, and having, peradventure, conceived them an hundred\ntimes, I am afraid I have set them down somewhere else already.\nRepetition is everywhere troublesome, though it were in Homer; but \u2018tis\nruinous in things that have only a superficial and transitory show.  I do\nnot love over-insisting, even in the most profitable things, as in\nSeneca; and the usage of his stoical school displeases me, to repeat,\nupon every subject, at full length and width the principles and\npresuppositions that serve in general, and always to realledge anew\ncommon and universal reasons.\n\nMy memory grows cruelly worse every day:\n\n                   \u201cPocula Lethaeos ut si ducentia somnos,\n                    Arente fauce traxerim;\u201d\n\n     [\u201cAs if my dry throat had drunk seducing cups of Lethaean\n     oblivion.\u201d--Horace, Epod., xiv. 3.]\n\nI must be fain for the time to come (for hitherto, thanks be to God,\nnothing has happened much amiss), whereas others seek time and\nopportunity to think of what they have to say, to avoid all preparation,\nfor fear of tying myself to some obligation upon which I must insist.  To\nbe tied and bound to a thing puts me quite out, and to depend upon so\nweak an instrument as my memory.  I never read this following story that\nI am not offended at it with a personal and natural resentment:\nLyncestes, accused of conspiracy against Alexander, the day that he was\nbrought out before the army, according to the custom, to be heard as to\nwhat he could say for himself, had learned a studied speech, of which,\nhesitating and stammering, he pronounced some words.  Whilst growing more\nand more perplexed, whilst struggling with his memory, and trying to\nrecollect what he had to say, the soldiers nearest to him charged their\npikes against him and killed him, looking upon him as convict; his\nconfusion and silence served them for a confession; for having had so\nmuch leisure to prepare himself in prison, they concluded that it was not\nhis memory that failed him, but that his conscience tied up his tongue\nand stopped his mouth.  And, truly, well said; the place, the assembly,\nthe expectation, astound a man, even when he has but the ambition to\nspeak well; what can a man do when \u2018tis an harangue upon which his life\ndepends?\n\nFor my part, the very being tied to what I am to say is enough to loose\nme from it.  When I wholly commit and refer myself to my memory, I lay so\nmuch stress upon it that it sinks under me: it grows dismayed with the\nburden.  So much as I trust to it, so much do I put myself out of my own\npower, even to the finding it difficult to keep my own countenance; and\nhave been sometimes very much put to it to conceal the slavery wherein I\nwas engaged; whereas my design is to manifest, in speaking, a perfect\ncalmness both of face and accent, and casual and unpremeditated motions,\nas rising from present occasions, choosing rather to say nothing to\npurpose than to show that I came prepared to speak well, a thing\nespecially unbecoming a man of my profession, and of too great obligation\non him who cannot retain much.  The preparation begets a great deal more\nexpectation than it will satisfy.  A man often strips himself to his\ndoublet to leap no farther than he would have done in his gown:\n\n          \u201cNihil est his, qui placere volunt, turn adversarium,\n          quam expectatio.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cNothing is so adverse to those who make it their business to\n     please as expectation\u201d--Cicero, Acad., ii. 4]\n\nIt is recorded of the orator Curio, that when he proposed the division of\nhis oration into three or four parts, or three or four arguments or\nreasons, it often happened either that he forgot some one, or added one\nor two more.  I have always avoided falling into this inconvenience,\nhaving ever hated these promises and prescriptions, not only out of\ndistrust of my memory, but also because this method relishes too much of\nthe artist:\n\n                    \u201cSimpliciora militares decent.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cSimplicity becomes warriors.\u201d--Quintilian, Instit. Orat., xi. I.]\n\n\u2018Tis enough that I have promised to myself never again to take upon me\nto speak in a place of respect, for as to speaking, when a man reads his\nspeech, besides that it is very absurd, it is a mighty disadvantage to\nthose who naturally could give it a grace by action; and to rely upon the\nmercy of my present invention, I would much less do it; \u2018tis heavy and\nperplexed, and such as would never furnish me in sudden and important\nnecessities.\n\nPermit, reader, this essay its course also, and this third sitting to\nfinish the rest of my picture: I add, but I correct not.  First, because\nI conceive that a man having once parted with his labours to the world,\nhe has no further right to them; let him do better if he can, in some new\nundertaking, but not adulterate what he has already sold.  Of such\ndealers nothing should be bought till after they are dead.  Let them well\nconsider what they do before they, produce it to the light who hastens\nthem?  My book is always the same, saving that upon every new edition\n(that the buyer may not go away quite empty) I take the liberty to add\n(as \u2018tis but an ill jointed marqueterie) some supernumerary emblem; it is\nbut overweight, that does not disfigure the primitive form of the essays,\nbut, by a little artful subtlety, gives a kind of particular value to\nevery one of those that follow.  Thence, however, will easily happen some\ntransposition of chronology, my stories taking place according to their\nopportuneness, not always according to their age.\n\nSecondly, because as to what concerns myself, I fear to lose by change:\nmy understanding does not always go forward, it goes backward too.  I do\nnot much less suspect my fancies for being the second or the third, than\nfor being the first, or present, or past; we often correct ourselves as\nfoolishly as we do others.  I am grown older by a great many years since\nmy first publications, which were in the year 1580; but I very much doubt\nwhether I am grown an inch the wiser.  I now, and I anon, are two several\npersons; but whether better, I cannot determine.  It were a fine thing to\nbe old, if we only travelled towards improvement; but \u2018tis a drunken,\nstumbling, reeling, infirm motion: like that of reeds, which the air\ncasually waves to and fro at pleasure.  Antiochus had in his youth\nstrongly written in favour of the Academy; in his old age he wrote as\nmuch against it; would not, which of these two soever I should follow, be\nstill Antiochus?  After having established the uncertainty, to go about\nto establish the certainty of human opinions, was it not to establish\ndoubt, and not certainty, and to promise, that had he had yet another age\nto live, he would be always upon terms of altering his judgment, not so\nmuch for the better, as for something else?\n\nThe public favour has given me a little more confidence than I expected;\nbut what I \u2018most fear is, lest I should glut the world with my writings;\nI had rather, of the two, pique my reader than tire him, as a learned man\nof my time has done.  Praise is always pleasing, let it come from whom,\nor upon what account it will; yet ought a man to understand why he is\ncommended, that he may know how to keep up the same reputation still:\nimperfections themselves may get commendation.  The vulgar and common\nestimation is seldom happy in hitting; and I am much mistaken if, amongst\nthe writings of my time, the worst are not those which have most gained\nthe popular applause.  For my part, I return my thanks to those\ngood-natured men who are pleased to take my weak endeavours in good part;\nthe faults of the workmanship are nowhere so apparent as in a matter\nwhich of itself has no recommendation.  Blame not me, reader, for those\nthat slip in here by the fancy or inadvertency of others; every hand,\nevery artisan, contribute their own materials; I neither concern myself\nwith orthography (and only care to have it after the old way) nor\npointing, being very inexpert both in the one and the other.  Where they\nwholly break the sense, I am very little concerned, for they at least\ndischarge me; but where they substitute a false one, as they so often do,\nand wrest me to their conception, they ruin me.  When the sentence,\nnevertheless, is not strong enough for my proportion, a civil person\nought to reject it as spurious, and none of mine.  Whoever shall know how\nlazy I am, and how indulgent to my own humour, will easily believe that I\nhad rather write as many more essays, than be tied to revise these over\nagain for so childish a correction.\n\nI said elsewhere, that being planted in the very centre of this new\nreligion, I am not only deprived of any great familiarity with men of\nother kind of manners than my own, and of other opinions, by which they\nhold together, as by a tie that supersedes all other obligations; but\nmoreover I do not live without danger, amongst men to whom all things are\nequally lawful, and of whom the most part cannot offend the laws more\nthan they have already done; from which the extremist degree of licence\nproceeds.  All the particular being summed up together, I do not find one\nman of my country, who pays so dear for the defence of our laws both in\nloss and damages (as the lawyers say) as myself; and some there are who\nvapour and brag of their zeal and constancy, that if things were justly\nweighed, do much less than I.  My house, as one that has ever been open\nand free to all comers, and civil to all (for I could never persuade\nmyself to make it a garrison of war, war being a thing that I prefer to\nsee as remote as may be), has sufficiently merited popular kindness, and\nso that it would be a hard matter justly to insult over me upon my own\ndunghill; and I look upon it as a wonderful and exemplary thing that it\nyet continues a virgin from blood and plunder during so long a storm, and\nso many neighbouring revolutions and tumults.  For to confess the truth,\nit had been possible enough for a man of my complexion to have shaken\nhands with any one constant and continued form whatever; but the contrary\ninvasions and incursions, alternations and vicissitudes of fortune round\nabout me, have hitherto more exasperated than calmed and mollified the\ntemper of the country, and involved me, over and over again, with\ninvincible difficulties and dangers.\n\nI escape, \u2018tis true, but am troubled that it is more by chance, and\nsomething of my own prudence, than by justice; and am not satisfied to be\nout of the protection of the laws, and under any other safeguard than\ntheirs.  As matters stand, I live, above one half, by the favour of\nothers, which is an untoward obligation.  I do not like to owe my safety\neither to the generosity or affection of great persons, who allow me my\nlegality and my liberty, or to the obliging manners of my predecessors,\nor my own: for what if I were another kind of man?  If my deportment, and\nthe frankness of my conversation or relationship, oblige my neighbours,\n\u2018tis that that they should acquit themselves of obligation in only\npermitting me to live, and they may say, \u201cWe allow him the free liberty\nof having divine service read in his own private chapel, when it is\ninterdicted in all churches round about, and allow him the use of his\ngoods and his life, as one who protects our wives and cattle in time of\nneed.\u201d  For my house has for many descents shared in the reputation of\nLycurgus the Athenian, who was the general depository and guardian of the\npurses of his fellow-citizens.  Now I am clearly of opinion that a man\nshould live by right and by authority, and not either by recompense or\nfavour.  How many gallant men have rather chosen to lose their lives than\nto be debtors for them?  I hate to subject myself to any sort of\nobligation, but above all, to that which binds me by the duty of honour.\nI think nothing so dear as what has been given me, and this because my\nwill lies at pawn under the title of gratitude, and more willingly accept\nof services that are to be sold; I feel that for the last I give nothing\nbut money, but for the other I give myself.\n\nThe knot that binds me by the laws of courtesy binds me more than that of\ncivil constraint; I am much more at ease when bound by a scrivener, than\nby myself.  Is it not reason that my conscience should be much more\nengaged when men simply rely upon it?  In a bond, my faith owes nothing,\nbecause it has nothing lent it; let them trust to the security they have\ntaken without me.  I had much rather break the wall of a prison and the\nlaws themselves than my own word.  I am nice, even to superstition, in\nkeeping my promises, and, therefore, upon all occasions have a care to\nmake them uncertain and conditional.  To those of no great moment, I add\nthe jealousy of my own rule, to make them weight; it wracks and oppresses\nme with its own interest.  Even in actions wholly my own and free, if I\nonce say a thing, I conceive that I have bound myself, and that\ndelivering it to the knowledge of another, I have positively enjoined it\nmy own performance.  Methinks I promise it, if I but say it: and\ntherefore am not apt to say much of that kind.  The sentence that I pass\nupon myself is more severe than that of a judge, who only considers the\ncommon obligation; but my conscience looks upon it with a more severe and\npenetrating eye.  I lag in those duties to which I should be compelled if\nI did not go:\n\n     \u201cHoc ipsum ita justum est, quod recte fit, si est voluntarium.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThis itself is so far just, that it is rightly done, if it is\n     voluntary.\u201d--Cicero, De Offic., i. 9.]\n\nIf the action has not some splendour of liberty, it has neither grace nor\nhonour:\n\n          \u201cQuod vos jus cogit, vix voluntate impetrent:\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThat which the laws compel us to do, we scarcely do with a will.\u201d\n      --Terence, Adelph., iii. 3, 44.]\n\nwhere necessity draws me, I love to let my will take its own course:\n\n          \u201cQuia quicquid imperio cogitur, exigenti magis,\n          quam praestanti, acceptum refertur.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cFor whatever is compelled by power, is more imputed to him that\n     exacts than to him that performs.\u201d--Valerius Maximus, ii. 2, 6.]\n\nI know some who follow this rule, even to injustice; who will sooner give\nthan restore, sooner lend than pay, and will do them the least good to\nwhom they are most obliged.  I don\u2019t go so far as that, but I\u2019m not far\noff.\n\nI so much love to disengage and disobligate myself, that I have sometimes\nlooked upon ingratitudes, affronts, and indignities which I have received\nfrom those to whom either by nature or accident I was bound in some way\nof friendship, as an advantage to me; taking this occasion of their\nill-usage, for an acquaintance and discharge of so much of my debt.  And\nthough I still continue to pay them all the external offices of public\nreason, I, notwithstanding, find a great saving in doing that upon the\naccount of justice which I did upon the score of affection, and am a\nlittle eased of the attention and solicitude of my inward will:\n\n     \u201cEst prudentis sustinere, ut currum, sic impetum benevolentia;\u201d\n\n     [\u201c\u2018Tis the part of a wise man to keep a curbing hand upon the\n     impetus of friendship, as upon that of his horse.\u201d\n      --Cicero, De Amicit., c. 17.]\n\n\u2018tis in me, too urging and pressing where I take; at least, for a man who\nloves not to be strained at all.  And this husbanding my friendship\nserves me for a sort of consolation in the imperfections of those in whom\nI am concerned.  I am very sorry they are not such as I could wish they\nwere, but then I also am spared somewhat of my application and engagement\ntowards them.  I approve of a man who is the less fond of his child for\nhaving a scald head, or for being crooked; and not only when he is\nill-conditioned, but also when he is of unhappy disposition, and imperfect\nin his limbs (God himself has abated so much from his value and natural\nestimation), provided he carry himself in this coldness of affection with\nmoderation and exact justice: proximity, with me, lessens not defects,\nbut rather aggravates them.\n\nAfter all, according to what I understand in the science of benefit and\nacknowledgment, which is a subtle science, and of great use, I know no\nperson whatever more free and less indebted than I am at this hour.  What\nI do owe is simply to foreign obligations and benefits; as to anything\nelse, no man is more absolutely clear:\n\n                   \u201cNec sunt mihi nota potentum\n                    Munera.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThe gifts of great men are unknown to me.\u201d--AEneid, xii. 529.]\n\nPrinces give me a great deal if they take nothing from me; and do me good\nenough if they do me no harm; that\u2019s all I ask from them.  O how am I\nobliged to God, that he has been pleased I should immediately receive\nfrom his bounty all I have, and specially reserved all my obligation to\nhimself.  How earnestly do I beg of his holy compassion that I may never\nowe essential thanks to any one.  O happy liberty wherein I have thus far\nlived.  May it continue with me to the last.  I endeavour to have no\nexpress need of any one:\n\n                    \u201cIn me omnis spec est mihi.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cAll my hope is in myself.\u201d--Terence, Adelph., iii. 5, 9.]\n\n\u2018Tis what every one may do in himself, but more easily they whom God has\nplaced in a condition exempt from natural and urgent necessities.  It is\na wretched and dangerous thing to depend upon others; we ourselves, in\nwhom is ever the most just and safest dependence, are not sufficiently\nsure.\n\nI have nothing mine but myself, and yet the possession is, in part,\ndefective and borrowed.  I fortify myself both in courage, which is the\nstrongest assistant, and also in fortune, therein wherewith to satisfy\nmyself, though everything else should forsake me.  Hippias of Elis not\nonly furnished himself with knowledge, that he might, at need, cheerfully\nretire from all other company to enjoy the Muses: nor only with the\nknowledge of philosophy, to teach his soul to be contented with itself,\nand bravely to subsist without outward conveniences, when fate would have\nit so; he was, moreover, so careful as to learn to cook, to shave\nhimself, to make his own clothes, his own shoes and drawers, to provide\nfor all his necessities in himself, and to wean himself from the\nassistance of others.  A man more freely and cheerfully enjoys borrowed\nconveniences, when it is not an enjoyment forced and constrained by need;\nand when he has, in his own will and fortune, the means to live without\nthem.  I know myself very well; but \u2018tis hard for me to imagine any so\npure liberality of any one towards me, any so frank and free hospitality,\nthat would not appear to me discreditable, tyrannical, and tainted with\nreproach, if necessity had reduced me to it.  As giving is an ambitious\nand authoritative quality, so is accepting a quality of submission;\nwitness the insulting and quarrelsome refusal that Bajazet made of the\npresents that Tamerlane sent him; and those that were offered on the part\nof the Emperor Solyman to the Emperor of Calicut, so angered him, that he\nnot only rudely rejected them, saying that neither he nor any of his\npredecessors had ever been wont to take, and that it was their office to\ngive; but, moreover, caused the ambassadors sent with the gifts to be put\ninto a dungeon.  When Thetis, says Aristotle, flatters Jupiter, when the\nLacedaemonians flatter the Athenians, they do not put them in mind of the\ngood they have done them, which is always odious, but of the benefits\nthey have received from them.  Such as I see so frequently employ every\none in their affairs, and thrust themselves into so much obligation,\nwould never do it, did they but relish as I do the sweetness of a pure\nliberty, and did they but weigh, as wise: men should, the burden of\nobligation: \u2018tis sometimes, peradventure, fully paid, but \u2018tis never\ndissolved.  \u2018Tis a miserable slavery to a man who loves to be at full\nliberty in all reapects.  Such as know me, both above and below me in\nstation, are able to say whether they have ever known a man less\nimportuning, soliciting, entreating, and pressing upon others than I.\nIf I am so, and a degree beyond all modern example, \u2018tis no great wonder,\nso many parts of my manners contributing to it: a little natural pride,\nan impatience at being refused, the moderation of my desires and designs,\nmy incapacity for business, and my most beloved qualities, idleness and\nfreedom; by all these together I have conceived a mortal hatred to being\nobliged to any other, or by any other than myself.  I leave no stone\nunturned, to do without it, rather than employ the bounty of another in\nany light or important occasion or necessity whatever.  My friends\nstrangely trouble me when they ask me to ask a third person; and I think\nit costs me little less to disengage him who is indebted to me, by making\nuse of him, than to engage myself to him who owes me nothing.  These\nconditions being removed, and provided they require of me nothing if any\ngreat trouble or care (for I have declared mortal war against all care),\nI am very ready to do every one the best service I can.  I have been very\nwilling to seek occasion to do people a good turn, and to attach them to\nme; and methinks there is no more agreeable employment for our means.\nBut I have yet more avoided receiving than sought occasions of giving,\nand moreover, according to Aristotle, it is more easy., My fortune has\nallowed me but little to do others good withal, and the little it can\nafford, is put into a pretty close hand.  Had I been born a great person,\nI should have been ambitious to have made myself beloved, not to make\nmyself feared or admired: shall I more plainly express it?  I should more\nhave endeavoured to please than to profit others.  Cyrus very wisely, and\nby the mouth of a great captain, and still greater philosopher, prefers\nhis bounty and benefits much before his valour and warlike conquests;\nand the elder Scipio, wherever he would raise himself in esteem, sets a\nhigher value upon his affability and humanity, than on his prowess and\nvictories, and has always this glorious saying in his mouth: \u201cThat he has\ngiven his enemies as much occasion to love him as his friends.\u201d  I will\nthen say, that if a man must, of necessity, owe something, it ought to be\nby a more legitimate title than that whereof I am speaking, to which the\nnecessity of this miserable war compels me; and not in so great a debt as\nthat of my total preservation both of life and fortune: it overwhelms me.\n\nI have a thousand times gone to bed in my own house with an apprehension\nthat I should be betrayed and murdered that very night; compounding with\nfortune, that it might be without terror and with quick despatch; and,\nafter my Paternoster, I have cried out,\n\n          \u201cImpius haec tam culta novalia miles habebit!\u201d\n\n     [\u201cShall impious soldiers have these new-ploughed grounds?\u201d\n      --Virgil, Ecl., i. 71.]\n\nWhat remedy?  \u2018tis the place of my birth, and that of most of my\nancestors; they have here fixed their affection and name.  We inure\nourselves to whatever we are accustomed to; and in so miserable a\ncondition as ours is, custom is a great bounty of nature, which benumbs\nout senses to the sufferance of many evils.  A civil war has this with it\nworse than other wars have, to make us stand sentinels in our own houses.\n\n              \u201cQuam miserum, porta vitam muroque tueri,\n               Vixque suae tutum viribus esse domus!\u201d\n\n     [\u201c\u2018Tis miserable to protect one\u2019s life by doors and walls, and to be\n     scarcely safe in one\u2019s own house.\u201d--Ovid, Trist., iv. I, 69.]\n\n\u2018Tis a grievous extremity for a man to be jostled even in his own house\nand domestic repose.  The country where I live is always the first in\narms and the last that lays them down, and where there is never an\nabsolute peace:\n\n         \u201cTunc quoque, cum pax est, trepidant formidine belli....\n          Quoties Romam fortuna lacessit;\n          Hac iter est bellis....  Melius, Fortuna, dedisses\n          Orbe sub Eco sedem, gelidaque sub Arcto,\n          Errantesque domos.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cEven when there\u2019s peace, there is here still the dear of war when\n     Fortune troubles peace, this is ever the way by which war passes.\u201d\n      --Ovid, Trist., iii. 10, 67.]\n\n     [\u201cWe might have lived happier in the remote East or in the icy\n     North, or among the wandering tribes.\u201d--Lucan, i. 255.]\n\nI sometimes extract the means to fortify myself against these\nconsiderations from indifference and indolence, which, in some sort,\nbring us on to resolution.  It often befalls me to imagine and expect\nmortal dangers with a kind of delight: I stupidly plunge myself headlong\ninto death, without considering or taking a view of it, as into a deep\nand obscure abyss which swallows me up at one leap, and involves me in an\ninstant in a profound sleep, without any sense of pain.  And in these\nshort and violent deaths, the consequence that I foresee administers more\nconsolation to me than the effect does fear.  They say, that as life is\nnot better for being long, so death is better for being not long.  I do\nnot so much evade being dead, as I enter into confidence with dying.  I\nwrap and shroud myself into the storm that is to blind and carry me away\nwith the fury of a sudden and insensible attack.  Moreover, if it should\nfall out that, as some gardeners say, roses and violets spring more\nodoriferous near garlic and onions, by reason that the last suck and\nimbibe all the ill odour of the earth; so, if these depraved natures\nshould also attract all the malignity of my air and climate, and render\nit so much better and purer by their vicinity, I should not lose all.\nThat cannot be: but there may be something in this, that goodness is more\nbeautiful and attractive when it is rare; and that contrariety and\ndiversity fortify and consolidate well-doing within itself, and inflame\nit by the jealousy of opposition and by glory.  Thieves and robbers, of\ntheir special favour, have no particular spite at me; no more have I to\nthem: I should have my hands too full.  Like consciences are lodged under\nseveral sorts of robes; like cruelty, disloyalty, rapine; and so much the\nworse, and more falsely, when the more secure and concealed under colour\nof the laws.  I less hate an open professed injury than one that is\ntreacherous; an enemy in arms, than an enemy in a gown.  Our fever has\nseized upon a body that is not much the worse for it; there was fire\nbefore, and now \u2018tis broken out into a flame; the noise is greater, not\nthe evil.  I ordinarily answer such as ask me the reason of my travels,\n\u201cThat I know very well what I fly from, but not what I seek.\u201d  If they\ntell me that there may be as little soundness amongst foreigners, and\nthat their manners are no better than ours: I first reply, that it is\nhard to be believed;\n\n                    \u201cTam multa: scelerum facies!\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThere are so many forms of crime.\u201d--Virgil, Georg., i. 506.]\n\nsecondly, that it is always gain to change an ill condition for one that\nis uncertain; and that the ills of others ought not to afflict us so much\nas our own.\n\nI will not here omit, that I never mutiny so much against France, that I\nam not perfectly friends with Paris; that city has ever had my heart from\nmy infancy, and it has fallen out, as of excellent things, that the more\nbeautiful cities I have seen since, the more the beauty of this still\nwins upon my affection.  I love her for herself, and more in her own\nnative being, than in all the pomp of foreign and acquired\nembellishments.  I love her tenderly, even to her warts and blemishes.\nI am a Frenchman only through this great city, great in people, great in\nthe felicity of her situation; but, above all, great and incomparable in\nvariety and diversity of commodities: the glory of France, and one of the\nmost noble ornaments of the world.  May God drive our divisions far from\nher.  Entire and united, I think her sufficiently defended from all other\nviolences.  I give her caution that, of all sorts of people, those will\nbe the worst that shall set her in discord; I have no fear for her, but\nof herself, and, certainly, I have as much fear for her as for any other\npart of the kingdom.  Whilst she shall continue, I shall never want a\nretreat, where I may stand at bay, sufficient to make me amends for\nparting with any other retreat.\n\nNot because Socrates has said so, but because it is in truth my own\nhumour, and peradventure not without some excess, I look upon all men as\nmy compatriots, and embrace a Polander as a Frenchman, preferring the\nuniversal and common tie to all national ties whatever.  I am not much\ntaken with the sweetness of a native air: acquaintance wholly new and\nwholly my own appear to me full as good as the other common and\nfortuitous ones with Four neighbours: friendships that are purely of our\nown acquiring ordinarily carry it above those to which the communication\nof climate or of blood oblige us.  Nature has placed us in the world free\nand unbound; we imprison ourselves in certain straits, like the kings of\nPersia, who obliged themselves to drink no other water but that of the\nriver Choaspes, foolishly quitted claim to their right in all other\nstreams, and, so far as concerned themselves, dried up all the other\nrivers of the world.  What Socrates did towards his end, to look upon a\nsentence of banishment as worse than a sentence of death against him, I\nshall, I think, never be either so decrepid or so strictly habituated to\nmy own country to be of that opinion.  These celestial lives have images\nenough that I embrace more by esteem than affection; and they have some\nalso so elevated and extraordinary that I cannot embrace them so much as\nby esteem, forasmuch as I cannot conceive them.  That fancy was singular\nin a man who thought the whole world his city; it is true that he\ndisdained travel, and had hardly ever set his foot out of the Attic\nterritories.  What say you to his complaint of the money his friends\noffered to save his life, and that he refused to come out of prison by\nthe mediation of others, in order not to disobey the laws in a time when\nthey were otherwise so corrupt?  These examples are of the first kind for\nme; of the second, there are others that I could find out in the same\nperson: many of these rare examples surpass the force of my action, but\nsome of them, moreover, surpass the force of my judgment.\n\nBesides these reasons, travel is in my opinion a very profitable\nexercise; the soul is there continually employed in observing new and\nunknown things, and I do not know, as I have often said a better school\nwherein to model life than by incessantly exposing to it the diversity\nof so many other lives, fancies, and usances, and by making it relish a\nperpetual variety of forms of human nature.  The body is, therein,\nneither idle nor overwrought; and that moderate agitation puts it in\nbreath.  I can keep on horseback, tormented with the stone as I am,\nwithout alighting or being weary, eight or ten hours together:\n\n               \u201cVires ultra sorternque senectae.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cBeyond the strength and lot of age.\u201d--AEneid, vi. 114.]\n\nNo season is enemy to me but the parching heat of a scorching sun; for\nthe umbrellas made use of in Italy, ever since the time of the ancient\nRomans, more burden a man\u2019s arm than they relieve his head.  I would fain\nknow how it was that the Persians, so long ago and in the infancy of\nluxury, made ventilators where they wanted them, and planted shades, as\nXenophon reports they did.  I love rain, and to dabble in the dirt, as\nwell as ducks do.  The change of air and climate never touches me; every\nsky is alike; I am only troubled with inward alterations which I breed\nwithin myself, and those are not so frequent in travel.  I am hard to be\ngot out, but being once upon the road, I hold out as well as the best.\nI take as much pains in little as in great attempts, and am as solicitous\nto equip myself for a short journey, if but to visit a neighbour, as for\nthe longest voyage.  I have learned to travel after the Spanish fashion,\nand to make but one stage of a great many miles; and in excessive heats\nI always travel by night, from sun set to sunrise.  The other method of\nbaiting by the way, in haste and hurry to gobble up a dinner, is,\nespecially in short days, very inconvenient.  My horses perform the\nbetter; never any horse tired under me that was able to hold out the\nfirst day\u2019s journey.  I water them at every brook I meet, and have only a\ncare they have so much way to go before I come to my inn, as will digest\nthe water in their bellies.  My unwillingness to rise in a morning gives\nmy servants leisure to dine at their ease before they set out; for my own\npart, I never eat too late; my appetite comes to me in eating, and not\nelse; I am never hungry but at table.\n\nSome of my friends blame me for continuing this travelling humour, being\nmarried and old.  But they are out in\u2019t; \u2018tis the best time to leave a\nman\u2019s house, when he has put it into a way of continuing without him, and\nsettled such order as corresponds with its former government.  \u2018Tis much\ngreater imprudence to abandon it to a less faithful housekeeper, and who\nwill be less solicitous to look after your affairs.\n\nThe most useful and honourable knowledge and employment for the mother of\na family is the science of good housewifery.  I see some that are\ncovetous indeed, but very few that are good managers.  \u2018Tis the supreme\nquality of a woman, which a man ought to seek before any other, as the\nonly dowry that must ruin or preserve our houses.  Let men say what they\nwill, according to the experience I have learned, I require in married\nwomen the economical virtue above all other virtues; I put my wife to\u2019t,\nas a concern of her own, leaving her, by my absence, the whole government\nof my affairs.  I see, and am vexed to see, in several families I know,\nMonsieur about noon come home all jaded and ruffled about his affairs,\nwhen Madame is still dressing her hair and tricking up herself, forsooth,\nin her closet: this is for queens to do, and that\u2019s a question, too: \u2018tis\nridiculous and unjust that the laziness of our wives should be maintained\nwith our sweat and labour.  No man, so far as in me lie, shall have a\nclearer, a more quiet and free fruition of his estate than I.  If the\nhusband bring matter, nature herself will that the wife find the form.\n\nAs to the duties of conjugal friendship, that some think to be impaired\nby these absences, I am quite of another opinion.  It is, on the\ncontrary, an intelligence that easily cools by a too frequent and\nassiduous companionship.  Every strange woman appears charming, and we\nall find by experience that being continually together is not so pleasing\nas to part for a time and meet again.  These interruptions fill me with\nfresh affection towards my family, and render my house more pleasant to\nme.  Change warms my appetite to the one and then to the other.  I know\nthat the arms of friendship are long enough to reach from the one end of\nthe world to the other, and especially this, where there is a continual\ncommunication of offices that rouse the obligation and remembrance.  The\nStoics say that there is so great connection and relation amongst the\nsages, that he who dines in France nourishes his companion in Egypt; and\nthat whoever does but hold out his finger, in what part of the world\nsoever, all the sages upon the habitable earth feel themselves assisted\nby it.  Fruition and possession principally appertain to the imagination;\nit more fervently and constantly embraces what it is in quest of, than\nwhat we hold in our arms.  Cast up your daily amusements; you will find\nthat you are most absent from your friend when he is present with you;\nhis presence relaxes your attention, and gives you liberty to absent\nyourself at every turn and upon every occasion.  When I am away at Rome,\nI keep and govern my house, and the conveniences I there left; see my\nwalls rise, my trees shoot, and my revenue increase or decrease, very\nnear as well as when I am there:\n\n          \u201cAnte oculos errat domus, errat forma locorum.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cMy house and the forms of places float before my eyes\u201d\n      --Ovid, Trist, iii. 4, 57.]\n\nIf we enjoy nothing but what we touch, we may say farewell to the money\nin our chests, and to our sons when they are gone a hunting.  We will\nhave them nearer to us: is the garden, or half a day\u2019s journey from home,\nfar?  What is ten leagues: far or near?  If near, what is eleven, twelve,\nor thirteen, and so by degrees.  In earnest, if there be a woman who can\ntell her husband what step ends the near and what step begins the remote,\nI would advise her to stop between;\n\n              \u201cExcludat jurgia finis .  .  .  .\n               Utor permisso; caudaeque pilos ut equinae\n               Paulatim vello, et demo unum, demo etiam unum\n               Dum cadat elusus ratione ruentis acervi:\u201d\n\n     [\u201cLet the end shut out all disputes .  .  .  .  I use what is\n     permitted; I pluck out the hairs of the horse\u2019s tail one by one;\n     while I thus outwit my opponent.\u201d--Horace, Ep., ii, I, 38, 45]\n\nand let them boldly call philosophy to their assistance; in whose teeth\nit may be cast that, seeing it neither discerns the one nor the other end\nof the joint, betwixt the too much and the little, the long and the\nshort, the light and the heavy, the near and the remote; that seeing it\ndiscovers neither the beginning nor the end, it must needs judge very\nuncertainly of the middle:\n\n          \u201cRerum natura nullam nobis dedit cognitionem finium.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cNature has green to us no knowledge of the end of things.\u201d\n      --Cicero, Acad., ii. 29.]\n\nAre they not still wives and friends to the dead who are not at the end\nof this but in the other world?  We embrace not only the absent, but\nthose who have been, and those who are not yet.  We do not promise in\nmarriage to be continually twisted and linked together, like some little\nanimals that we see, or, like the bewitched folks of Karenty,--[Karantia,\na town in the isle of Rugen.  See Saxo-Grammaticus, Hist.  of Denmark,\nbook xiv.]--tied together like dogs; and a wife ought not to be so\ngreedily enamoured of her husband\u2019s foreparts, that she cannot endure to\nsee him turn his back, if occasion be.  But may not this saying of that\nexcellent painter of woman\u2019s humours be here introduced, to show the\nreason of their complaints?\n\n         \u201cUxor, si cesses, aut to amare cogitat,\n          Aut tete amari, aut potare, aut animo obsequi;\n          Et tibi bene esse soli, cum sibi sit male;\u201d\n\n     [\u201cYour wife, if you loiter, thinks that you love or are beloved; or\n     that you are drinking or following your inclination; and that it is\n     well for you when it is ill for her (all the pleasure is yours and\n     hers all the care).\u201d\n      --Terence, Adelph., act i., sc. I, v.  7.]\n\nor may it not be, that of itself opposition and contradiction entertain\nand nourish them, and that they sufficiently accommodate themselves,\nprovided they incommodate you?\n\nIn true friendship, wherein I am perfect, I more give myself to my\nfriend, than I endeavour to attract him to me.  I am not only better\npleased in doing him service than if he conferred a benefit upon me,\nbut, moreover, had rather he should do himself good than me, and he most\nobliges me when he does so; and if absence be either more pleasant or\nconvenient for him, \u2018tis also more acceptable to me than his presence;\nneither is it properly absence, when we can write to one another: I have\nsometimes made good use of our separation from one another: we better\nfilled and further extended the possession of life in being parted.\nHe--[La Boetie.]--lived, enjoyed, and saw for me, and I for him, as\nfully as if he had himself been there; one part of us remained idle, and\nwe were too much blended in one another when we were together; the\ndistance of place rendered the conjunction of our wills more rich.  This\ninsatiable desire of personal presence a little implies weakness in the\nfruition of souls.\n\nAs to what concerns age, which is alleged against me, \u2018tis quite\ncontrary; \u2018tis for youth to subject itself to common opinions, and to\ncurb itself to please others; it has wherewithal to please both the\npeople and itself; we have but too much ado to please ourselves alone.\nAs natural conveniences fail, let us supply them with those that are\nartificial.  \u2018Tis injustice to excuse youth for pursuing its pleasures,\nand to forbid old men to seek them.  When young, I concealed my wanton\npassions with prudence; now I am old, I chase away melancholy by debauch.\nAnd thus do the platonic laws forbid men to travel till forty or fifty\nyears old, so that travel might be more useful and instructive in so\nmature an age.  I should sooner subscribe to the second article of the\nsame Laws, which forbids it after threescore.\n\n\u201cBut, at such an age, you will never return from so long a journey.\u201d\n What care I for that?  I neither undertake it to return, nor to finish it\nmy business is only to keep myself in motion, whilst motion pleases me;\nI only walk for the walk\u2019s sake.  They who run after a benefit or a hare,\nrun not; they only run who run at base, and to exercise their running.\nMy design is divisible throughout: it is not grounded upon any great\nhopes: every day concludes my expectation: and the journey of my life is\ncarried on after the same manner.  And yet I have seen places enough a\ngreat way off, where I could have wished to have stayed.  And why not,\nif Chrysippus, Cleanthes, Diogenes, Zeno, Antipater, so many sages of the\nsourest sect, readily abandoned their country, without occasion of\ncomplaint, and only for the enjoyment of another air.  In earnest, that\nwhich most displeases me in all my travels is, that I cannot resolve to\nsettle my abode where I should best like, but that I must always propose\nto myself to return, to accommodate myself to the common humour.\n\nIf I feared to die in any other place than that of my birth; if I thought\nI should die more uneasily remote from my own family, I should hardly go\nout of France; I should not, without fear, step out of my parish; I feel\ndeath always pinching me by the throat or by the back.  But I am\notherwise constituted; \u2018tis in all places alike to me.  Yet, might I have\nmy choice, I think I should rather choose to die on horseback than in\nbed; out of my own house, and far from my own people.  There is more\nheartbreaking than consolation in taking leave of one\u2019s friends; I am\nwilling to omit that civility, for that, of all the offices of\nfriendship, is the only one that is unpleasant; and I could, with all my\nheart, dispense with that great and eternal farewell.  If there be any\nconvenience in so many standers-by, it brings an hundred inconveniences\nalong with it.  I have seen many dying miserably surrounded with all this\ntrain: \u2018tis a crowd that chokes them.  \u2018Tis against duty, and is a\ntestimony of little kindness and little care, to permit you to die in\nrepose; one torments your eyes, another your ears, another your tongue;\nyou have neither sense nor member that is not worried by them.  Your\nheart is wounded with compassion to hear the mourning of friends, and,\nperhaps with anger, to hear the counterfeit condolings of pretenders.\nWho ever has been delicate and sensitive, when well, is much more so when\nill.  In such a necessity, a gentle hand is required, accommodated to his\nsentiment, to scratch him just in the place where he itches, otherwise\nscratch him not at all.  If we stand in need of a wise woman--[midwife,\nFr. \u2018sage femme\u2019.]--to bring us into the world, we have much more need\nof a still wiser man to help us out of it.  Such a one, and a friend to\nboot, a man ought to purchase at any cost for such an occasion.  I am not\nyet arrived to that pitch of disdainful vigour that is fortified in\nitself, that nothing can assist or disturb; I am of a lower form; I\nendeavour to hide myself, and to escape from this passage, not by fear,\nbut by art.  I do not intend in this act of dying to make proof and show\nof my constancy. For whom should I do it? all the right and interest I\nhave in reputation will then cease.  I content myself with a death\ninvolved within itself, quiet, solitary, and all my own, suitable to my\nretired and private life; quite contrary to the Roman superstition, where\na man was looked upon as unhappy who died without speaking, and who had\nnot his nearest relations to close his eyes.  I have enough to do to\ncomfort myself, without having to console others; thoughts enough in my\nhead, not to need that circumstances should possess me with new; and\nmatter enough to occupy me without borrowing.  This affair is out of the\npart of society; \u2018tis the act of one single person.  Let us live and be\nmerry amongst our friends; let us go repine and die amongst strangers; a\nman may find those, for his money, who will shift his pillow and rub his\nfeet, and will trouble him no more than he would have them; who will\npresent to him an indifferent countenance, and suffer him to govern\nhimself, and to complain according to his own method.\n\nI wean myself daily by my reason from this childish and inhuman humour,\nof desiring by our sufferings to move the compassion and mourning of our\nfriends: we stretch our own incommodities beyond their just extent when\nwe extract tears from others; and the constancy which we commend in every\none in supporting his adverse fortune, we accuse and reproach in our\nfriends when the evil is our own; we are not satisfied that they should\nbe sensible of our condition only, unless they be, moreover, afflicted.\nA man should diffuse joy, but, as much as he can, smother grief.  He who\nmakes himself lamented without reason is a man not to be lamented when\nthere shall be real cause: to be always complaining is the way never to\nbe lamented; by making himself always in so pitiful a taking, he is never\ncommiserated by any.  He who makes himself out dead when he is alive, is\nsubject to be thought living when he is dying.  I have seen some who have\ntaken it ill when they have been told that they looked well, and that\ntheir pulse was good; restrain their smiles, because they betrayed a\nrecovery, and be angry, at their health because it was not to be\nlamented: and, which is a great deal more, these were not women.\nI describe my infirmities, such as they really are, at most, and avoid\nall expressions of evil prognostic and composed exclamations.  If not\nmirth, at least a temperate countenance in the standers-by, is proper in\nthe presence of a wise sick man: he does not quarrel with health, for,\nseeing himself in a contrary condition, he is pleased to contemplate it\nsound and entire in others, and at least to enjoy it for company: he does\nnot, for feeling himself melt away, abandon all living thoughts, nor\navoid ordinary discourse.  I would study sickness whilst I am well; when\nit has seized me, it will make its impression real enough, without the\nhelp of my imagination.  We prepare ourselves beforehand for the journeys\nwe undertake, and resolve upon them; we leave the appointment of the hour\nwhen to take horse to the company, and in their favour defer it.\n\nI find this unexpected advantage in the publication of my manners, that\nit in some sort serves me for a rule.  I have, at times, some\nconsideration of not betraying the history of my life: this public\ndeclaration obliges me to keep my way, and not to give the lie to the\nimage I have drawn of my qualities, commonly less deformed and\ncontradictory than consists with the malignity and infirmity of the\njudgments of this age.  The uniformity and simplicity of my manners\nproduce a face of easy interpretation; but because the fashion is a\nlittle new and not in use, it gives too great opportunity to slander.\nYet so it is, that whoever would fairly assail me, I think I so\nsufficiently assist his purpose in my known and avowed imperfections,\nthat he may that way satisfy his ill-nature without fighting with the\nwind.  If I myself, to anticipate accusation and discovery, confess\nenough to frustrate his malice, as he conceives, \u2018tis but reason that he\nmake use of his right of amplification, and to wire-draw my vices as far\nas he can; attack has its rights beyond justice; and let him make the\nroots of those errors I have laid open to him shoot up into trees: let\nhim make his use, not only of those I am really affected with, but also\nof those that only threaten me; injurious vices, both in quality and\nnumber; let him cudgel me that way.  I should willingly follow the\nexample of the philosopher Bion: Antigonus being about to reproach him\nwith the meanness of his birth, he presently cut him short with this\ndeclaration: \u201cI am,\u201d said he, \u201cthe son of a slave, a butcher, and\nbranded, and of a strumpet my father married in the lowest of his\nfortune; both of them were whipped for offences they had committed.  An\norator bought me, when a child, and finding me a pretty and hopeful boy,\nbred me up, and when he died left me all his estate, which I have\ntransported into this city of Athens, and here settled myself to the\nstudy of philosophy.  Let the historians never trouble themselves with\ninquiring about me: I will tell them about it.\u201d  A free and generous\nconfession enervates reproach and disarms slander.  So it is that, one\nthing with another, I fancy men as often commend as undervalue me beyond\nreason; as, methinks also, from my childhood, in rank and degree of\nhonour, they have given me a place rather above than below my right.\nI should find myself more at ease in a country where these degrees were\neither regulated or not regarded.  Amongst men, when an altercation about\nthe precedence either of walking or sitting exceeds three replies, \u2018tis\nreputed uncivil.  I never stick at giving or taking place out of rule, to\navoid the trouble of such ceremony; and never any man had a mind to go\nbefore me, but I permitted him to do it.\n\nBesides this profit I make of writing of myself, I have also hoped for\nthis other advantage, that if it should fall out that my humour should\nplease or jump with those of some honest man before I die, he would then\ndesire and seek to be acquainted with me.  I have given him a great deal\nof made-way; for all that he could have, in many years, acquired by close\nfamiliarity, he has seen in three days in this memorial, and more surely\nand exactly.  A pleasant fancy: many things that I would not confess to\nany one in particular, I deliver to the public, and send my best friends\nto a bookseller\u2019s shop, there to inform themselves concerning my most\nsecret thoughts;\n\n                    \u201cExcutienda damus praecordia.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cWe give our hearts to be examined.\u201d--Persius, V. 22.]\n\nDid I, by good direction, know where to seek any one proper for my\nconversation, I should certainly go a great way to find him out: for the\nsweetness of suitable and agreeable company cannot; in my opinion, be\nbought too dear.  O what a thing is a true friend!  how true is that old\nsaying, that the use of a friend is more pleasing and necessary than the\nelements of water and fire!\n\nTo return to my subject: there is, then, no great harm in dying privately\nand far from home; we conceive ourselves obliged to retire for natural\nactions less unseemly and less terrible than this.  But, moreover, such\nas are reduced to spin out a long languishing life, ought not, perhaps,\nto wish to trouble a great family with their continual miseries;\ntherefore the Indians, in a certain province, thought it just to knock a\nman on the head when reduced to such a necessity; and in another of their\nprovinces, they all forsook him to shift for himself as well as he could.\nTo whom do they not, at last, become tedious and insupportable? the\nordinary offices of fife do not go that length.  You teach your best\nfriends to be cruel perforce; hardening wife and children by long use\nneither to regard nor to lament your sufferings.  The groans of the stone\nare grown so familiar to my people, that nobody takes any notice of them.\nAnd though we should extract some pleasure from their conversation (which\ndoes not always happen, by reason of the disparity of conditions, which\neasily begets contempt or envy toward any one whatever), is it not too\nmuch to make abuse of this half a lifetime?  The more I should see them\nconstrain themselves out of affection to be serviceable to me, the more I\nshould be sorry for their pains.  We have liberty to lean, but not to lay\nour whole weight upon others, so as to prop ourselves by their ruin; like\nhim who caused little children\u2019s throats to be cut to make use of their\nblood for the cure of a disease he had, or that other, who was\ncontinually supplied with tender young girls to keep his old limbs warm\nin the night, and to mix the sweetness of their breath with his, sour and\nstinking.  I should readily advise Venice as a retreat in this decline of\nlife.  Decrepitude is a solitary quality.  I am sociable even to excess,\nyet I think it reasonable that I should now withdraw my troubles from the\nsight of the world and keep them to myself.  Let me shrink and draw up\nmyself in my own shell, like a tortoise, and learn to see men without\nhanging upon them.  I should endanger them in so slippery a passage: \u2018tis\ntime to turn my back to company.\n\n\u201cBut, in these travels, you will be taken ill in some wretched place,\nwhere nothing can be had to relieve you.\u201d  I always carry most things\nnecessary about me; and besides, we cannot evade Fortune if she once\nresolves to attack us.  I need nothing extraordinary when I am sick.\nI will not be beholden to my bolus to do that for me which nature cannot.\nAt the very beginning of my fevers and sicknesses that cast me down,\nwhilst still entire, and but little, disordered in health, I reconcile\nmyself to Almighty God by the last Christian, offices, and find myself by\nso doing less oppressed and more easy, and have got, methinks, so much\nthe better of my disease.  And I have yet less need of a notary or\ncounsellor than of a physician.  What I have not settled of my affairs\nwhen I was in health, let no one expect I should do it when I am sick.\nWhat I will do for the service of death is always done; I durst not so\nmuch as one day defer it; and if nothing be done, \u2018tis as much as to say\neither that doubt hindered my choice (and sometimes \u2018tis well chosen not\nto choose), or that I was positively resolved not to do anything at all.\n\nI write my book for few men and for few years.  Had it been matter of\nduration, I should have put it into firmer language.  According to the\ncontinual variation that ours has been subject to, up to this day, who\ncan expect that its present form should be in use fifty years hence?\nIt slips every day through our fingers, and since I was born, it is\naltered above one-half.  We say that it is now perfect; and every age\nsays the same of its own.  I shall hardly trust to that, so long as it\nvaries and changes as it does.  \u2018Tis for good and useful writings to\nrivet it to them, and its reputation will go according to the fortune of\nour state.  For which reason I am not afraid to insert in it several\nprivate articles, which will spend their use amongst the men that are now\nliving, and that concern the particular knowledge of some who will see\nfurther into them than every common reader.  I will not, after all, as I\noften hear dead men spoken of, that men should say of me: \u201cHe judged, he\nlived so and so; he would have done this or that; could he have spoken\nwhen he was dying, he would have said so or so, and have given this thing\nor t\u2019other; I knew him better than any.\u201d  Now, as much as decency\npermits, I here discover my inclinations and affections; but I do more\nwillingly and freely by word of mouth to any one who desires to be\ninformed.  So it is that in these memoirs, if any one observe, he will\nfind that I have either told or designed to tell all; what I cannot\nexpress, I point out with my finger:\n\n              \u201cVerum animo satis haec vestigia parva sagaci\n               Sunt, per quae possis cognoscere caetera tute\u201d\n\n     [\u201cBy these footsteps a sagacious mind many easily find all other\n     matters (are sufficient to enable one to learn the rest well.)\u201d\n      --Lucretius, i. 403.]\n\nI leave nothing to be desired or to be guessed at concerning me.  If\npeople must be talking of me, I would have it to be justly and truly; I\nwould come again, with all my heart, from the other world to give any one\nthe lie who should report me other than I was, though he did it to honour\nme.  I perceive that people represent, even living men, quite another\nthing than what they really are; and had I not stoutly defended a friend\nwhom I have lost,--[De la Boetie.]--they would have torn him into a\nthousand contrary pieces.\n\nTo conclude the account of my poor humours, I confess that in my travels\nI seldom reach my inn but that it comes into my mind to consider whether\nI could there be sick and dying at my ease.  I desire to be lodged in\nsome private part of the house, remote from all noise, ill scents, and\nsmoke.  I endeavour to flatter death by these frivolous circumstances;\nor, to say better, to discharge myself from all other incumbrances, that\nI may have nothing to do, nor be troubled with anything but that which\nwill lie heavy enough upon me without any other load.  I would have my\ndeath share in the ease and conveniences of my life; \u2018tis a great part of\nit, and of great importance, and I hope it will not in the future\ncontradict the past.  Death has some forms that are more easy than\nothers, and receives divers qualities, according to every one\u2019s fancy.\nAmongst the natural deaths, that which proceeds from weakness and stupor\nI think the most favourable; amongst those that are violent, I can worse\nendure to think of a precipice than of the fall of a house that will\ncrush me in a moment, and of a wound with a sword than of a harquebus\nshot; I should rather have chosen to poison myself with Socrates, than\nstab myself with Cato.  And, though it, be all one, yet my imagination\nmakes as great a difference as betwixt death and life, betwixt throwing\nmyself into a burning furnace and plunging into the channel of a river:\nso idly does our fear more concern itself in the means than the effect.\nIt is but an instant, \u2018tis true, but withal an instant of such weight,\nthat I would willingly give a great many days of my life to pass it over\nafter my own fashion.  Since every one\u2019s imagination renders it more or\nless terrible, and since every one has some choice amongst the several\nforms of dying, let us try a little further to find some one that is\nwholly clear from all offence.  Might not one render it even voluptuous,\nlike the Commoyientes of Antony and Cleopatra?  I set aside the brave and\nexemplary efforts produced by philosophy and religion; but, amongst men\nof little mark there have been found some, such as Petronius and\nTigellinus at Rome, condemned to despatch themselves, who have, as it\nwere, rocked death asleep with the delicacy of their preparations; they\nhave made it slip and steal away in the height of their accustomed\ndiversions amongst girls and good fellows; not a word of consolation, no\nmention of making a will, no ambitious affectation of constancy, no talk\nof their future condition; amongst sports, feastings, wit, and mirth,\ncommon and indifferent discourses, music, and amorous verses.  Were it\nnot possible for us to imitate this resolution after a more decent\nmanner?  Since there are deaths that are good for fools, deaths good for\nthe wise, let us find out such as are fit for those who are betwixt both.\nMy imagination suggests to me one that is easy, and, since we must die,\nto be desired.  The Roman tyrants thought they did, in a manner, give a\ncriminal life when they gave him the choice of his death.  But was not\nTheophrastus, that so delicate, so modest, and so wise a philosopher,\ncompelled by reason, when he durst say this verse, translated by Cicero:\n\n               \u201cVitam regit fortuna, non sapientia?\u201d\n\n               [\u201cFortune, not wisdom, sways human life.\u201d\n                --Cicero, Tusc.  Quaes., V. 31.]\n\nFortune assists the facility of the bargain of my life, having placed it\nin such a condition that for the future it can be neither advantage nor\nhindrance to those who are concerned in me; \u2018tis a condition that I would\nhave accepted at any time of my life; but in this occasion of trussing up\nmy baggage, I am particularly pleased that in dying I shall neither do\nthem good nor harm.  She has so ordered it, by a cunning compensation,\nthat they who may pretend to any considerable advantage by my death will,\nat the same time, sustain a material inconvenience.  Death sometimes is\nmore grievous to us, in that it is grievous to others, and interests us\nin their interest as much as in our own, and sometimes more.\n\nIn this conveniency of lodging that I desire, I mix nothing of pomp and\namplitude--I hate it rather; but a certain plain neatness, which is\noftenest found in places where there is less of art, and that Nature has\nadorned with some grace that is all her own:\n\n               \u201cNon ampliter, sea munditer convivium.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cTo eat not largely, but cleanly.\u201d--Nepos, Life of Atticus, c. 13]\n\n                    \u201cPlus salis quam sumptus.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cRather enough than costly (More wit than cost)\u201d--Nonius, xi. 19.]\n\nAnd besides, \u2018tis for those whose affairs compel them to travel in the\ndepth of winter through the Grisons country to be surprised upon the way\nwith great inconveniences.  I, who, for the most part, travel for my\npleasure, do not order my affairs so ill.  If the way be foul on my right\nhand, I turn on my left; if I find myself unfit to ride, I stay where I\nam; and, so doing, in earnest I see nothing that is not as pleasant and\ncommodious as my own house.  \u2018Tis true that I always find superfluity\nsuperfluous, and observe a kind of trouble even in abundance itself.\nHave I left anything behind me unseen, I go back to see it; \u2018tis still on\nmy way; I trace no certain line, either straight or crooked.--[Rousseau\nhas translated this passage in his Emile, book v.]--Do I not find in the\nplace to which I go what was reported to me--as it often falls out that\nthe judgments of others do not jump with mine, and that I have found\ntheir reports for the most part false--I never complain of losing my\nlabour: I have, at least, informed myself that what was told me was not\ntrue.\n\nI have a constitution of body as free, and a palate as indifferent, as\nany man living: the diversity of manners of several nations only affects\nme in the pleasure of variety: every usage has its reason.  Let the plate\nand dishes be pewter, wood, or earth; my meat be boiled or roasted; let\nthem give me butter or oil, of nuts or olives, hot or cold, \u2018tis all one\nto me; and so indifferent, that growing old, I accuse this generous\nfaculty, and would wish that delicacy and choice should correct the\nindiscretion of my appetite, and sometimes soothe my stomach.  When I\nhave been abroad out of France and that people, out of courtesy, have\nasked me if I would be served after the French manner, I laughed at the\nquestion, and always frequented tables the most filled with foreigners.\nI am ashamed to see our countrymen besotted with this foolish humour of\nquarrelling with forms contrary to their own; they seem to be out of\ntheir element when out of their own village: wherever they go, they keep\nto their own fashions and abominate those of strangers.  Do they meet\nwith a compatriot in Hungary?  O the happy chance!  They are henceforward\ninseparable; they cling together, and their whole discourse is to condemn\nthe barbarous manners they see about them.  Why barbarous, because they\nare not French?  And those have made the best use of their travels who\nhave observed most to speak against.  Most of them go for no other end\nbut to come back again; they proceed in their travel with vast gravity\nand circumspection, with a silent and incommunicable prudence, preserving\nthemselves from the contagion of an unknown air.  What I am saying of\nthem puts me in mind of something like it I have at times observed in\nsome of our young courtiers; they will not mix with any but men of their\nown sort, and look upon us as men of another world, with disdain or pity.\nPut them upon any discourse but the intrigues of the court, and they are\nutterly at a loss; as very owls and novices to us as we are to them.\n\u2018Tis truly said that a well-bred man is a compound man.  I, on the\ncontrary, travel very much sated with our own fashions; I do not look for\nGascons in Sicily; I have left enough of them at home; I rather seek for\nGreeks and Persians; they are the men I endeavour to be acquainted with\nand the men I study; \u2018tis there that I bestow and employ myself.  And\nwhich is more, I fancy that I have met but with few customs that are not\nas good as our own; I have not, I confess, travelled very far; scarce out\nof the sight of the vanes of my own house.\n\nAs to the rest, most of the accidental company a man falls into upon the\nroad beget him more trouble than pleasure; I waive them as much as I\ncivilly can, especially now that age seems in some sort to privilege and\nsequester me from the common forms.  You suffer for others or others\nsuffer for you; both of them inconveniences of importance enough, but the\nlatter appears to me the greater.  \u2018Tis a rare fortune, but of\ninestimable solace; to have a worthy man, one of a sound judgment and of\nmanners conformable to your own, who takes a delight to bear you company.\nI have been at an infinite loss for such upon my travels.  But such a\ncompanion should be chosen and acquired from your first setting out.\nThere can be no pleasure to me without communication: there is not so\nmuch as a sprightly thought comes into my mind, that it does not grieve\nme to have produced alone, and that I have no one to communicate it to:\n\n          \u201cSi cum hac exceptione detur sapientia,\n          ut illam inclusam teneam, nec enuntiem, rejiciam.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cIf wisdom be conferred with this reservation, that I must keep it\n     to myself, and not communicate it to others, I would none of it.\u201d\n      --Seneca, Ep., 6.]\n\nThis other has strained it one note higher:\n\n     \u201cSi contigerit ea vita sapienti, ut ommum rerum afliuentibus copiis,\n     quamvis omnia, quae cognitione digna sunt, summo otio secum ipse\n     consideret et contempletur, tamen, si solitudo tanta sit, ut hominem\n     videre non possit, excedat a vita.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cIf such a condition of life should happen to a wise man, that in\n     the greatest plenty of all conveniences he might, at the most\n     undisturbed leisure, consider and contemplate all things worth the\n     knowing, yet if his solitude be such that he must not see a man, let\n     him depart from life.\u201d--Cicero, De Offic., i. 43.]\n\nArchitas pleases me when he says, \u201cthat it would be unpleasant, even in\nheaven itself, to wander in those great and divine celestial bodies\nwithout a companion.  But yet \u2018tis much better to be alone than in\nfoolish and troublesome company.  Aristippus loved to live as a stranger\nin all places:\n\n              \u201cMe si fata meis paterentur ducere vitam\n               Auspiciis,\u201d\n\n     [\u201cIf the fates would let me live in my own way.\u201d--AEneid, iv. 340.]\n\nI should choose to pass away the greatest part of my life on horseback:\n\n                   \u201cVisere gestiens,\n                    Qua pane debacchentur ignes,\n                    Qua nebula, pluviique rores.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cVisit the regions where the sun burns, where are the thick\n     rain-clouds and the frosts.\u201d--Horace, Od., iii. 3, 54.]\n\n\u201cHave you not more easy diversions at home?  What do you there want?  Is\nnot your house situated in a sweet and healthful air, sufficiently\nfurnished, and more than sufficiently large?  Has not the royal majesty\nbeen more than once there entertained with all its train?  Are there not\nmore below your family in good ease than there are above it in eminence?\nIs there any local, extraordinary, indigestible thought that afflicts\nyou?\u201d\n\n          \u201cQua to nunc coquat, et vexet sub pectore fixa.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThat may now worry you, and vex, fixed in your breast.\u201d\n      --Cicero, De Senect, c. 1, Ex Ennio.]\n\n\u201cWhere do you think to live without disturbance?\u201d\n\n                   \u201cNunquam simpliciter Fortuna indulget.\u201d\n\n               [\u201cFortune is never simply complaisant (unmixed).\u201d\n                --Quintus Curtius, iv. 14]\n\nYou see, then, it is only you that trouble yourself; you will everywhere\nfollow yourself, and everywhere complain; for there is no satisfaction\nhere below, but either for brutish or for divine souls.  He who, on so\njust an occasion, has no contentment, where will he think to find it?\nHow many thousands of men terminate their wishes in such a condition as\nyours?  Do but reform yourself; for that is wholly in your own power!\nwhereas you have no other right but patience towards fortune:\n\n          \u201cNulla placida quies est, nisi quam ratio composuit.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThere is no tranquillity but that which reason has conferred.\u201d\n      --Seneca, Ep., 56.]\n\nI see the reason of this advice, and see it perfectly well; but he might\nsooner have done, and more pertinently, in bidding me in one word be\nwise; that resolution is beyond wisdom; \u2018tis her precise work and\nproduct.  Thus the physician keeps preaching to a poor languishing\npatient to \u201cbe cheerful\u201d; but he would advise him a little more\ndiscreetly in bidding him \u201cbe well.\u201d  For my part, I am but a man of the\ncommon sort.  \u2018Tis a wholesome precept, certain and easy to be\nunderstood, \u201cBe content with what you have,\u201d that is to say, with reason:\nand yet to follow this advice is no more in the power of the wise men of\nthe world than in me.  \u2018Tis a common saying, but of a terrible extent:\nwhat does it not comprehend?  All things fall under discretion and\nqualification.  I know very well that, to take it by the letter, this\npleasure of travelling is a testimony of uneasiness and irresolution,\nand, in sooth, these two are our governing and predominating qualities.\nYes, I confess, I see nothing, not so much as in a dream, in a wish,\nwhereon I could set up my rest: variety only, and the possession of\ndiversity, can satisfy me; that is, if anything can.  In travelling, it\npleases me that I may stay where I like, without inconvenience, and that\nI have a place wherein commodiously to divert myself.  I love a private\nlife, because \u2018tis my own choice that I love it, not by any dissenting\nfrom or dislike of public life, which, peradventure, is as much according\nto my complexion.  I serve my prince more cheerfully because it is by the\nfree election of my own judgment and reason, without any particular\nobligation; and that I am not reduced and constrained so to do for being\nrejected or disliked by the other party; and so of all the rest.  I hate\nthe morsels that necessity carves me; any commodity upon which I had only\nto depend would have me by the throat;\n\n          \u201cAlter remus aquas, alter mihi radat arenas;\u201d\n\n     [\u201cLet me have one oar in the water, and with the other rake the\n     shore.\u201d--Propertius, iii. 3, 23.]\n\none cord will never hold me fast enough.  You will say, there is vanity\nin this way of living.  But where is there not?  All these fine precepts\nare vanity, and all wisdom is vanity:\n\n     \u201cDominus novit cogitationes sapientum, quoniam vanae sunt.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThe Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain.\u201d\n      --Ps. xciii. II; or I Cor. iii. 20.]\n\nThese exquisite subtleties are only fit for sermons; they are discourses\nthat will send us all saddled into the other world.  Life is a material\nand corporal motion, an action imperfect and irregular of its own proper\nessence; I make it my business to serve it according to itself:\n\n                    \u201cQuisque suos patimur manes.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cWe each of us suffer our own particular demon.\u201d--AEneid, vi. 743.]\n\n     \u201cSic est faciendum, ut contra naturam universam nihil contendamus;\n     ea tamen conservata propriam sequamur.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cWe must so order it as by no means to contend against universal\n     nature; but yet, that rule being observed, to follow our own.\u201d\n      --Cicero, De Offcc., i.  31.]\n\nTo what end are these elevated points of philosophy, upon which no human\nbeing can rely? and those rules that exceed both our use and force?\n\nI see often that we have theories of life set before us which neither the\nproposer nor those who hear him have any hope, nor, which is more, any\ninclination to follow.  Of the same sheet of paper whereon the judge has\nbut just written a sentence against an adulterer, he steals a piece\nwhereon to write a love-letter to his companion\u2019s wife.  She whom you\nhave but just now illicitly embraced will presently, even in your\nhearing, more loudly inveigh against the same fault in her companion than\na Portia would do;--[The chaste daughter of Cato of Utica.]--and men\nthere are who will condemn others to death for crimes that they\nthemselves do not repute so much as faults.  I have, in my youth, seen a\nman of good rank with one hand present to the people verses that excelled\nboth in wit and debauchery, and with the other, at the same time, the\nmost ripe and pugnacious theological reformation that the world has been\ntreated withal these many years.  And so men proceed; we let the laws and\nprecepts follow their way; ourselves keep another course, not only from\ndebauchery of manners, but ofttimes by judgment and contrary opinion.  Do\nbut hear a philosophical lecture; the invention, eloquence, pertinency\nimmediately strike upon your mind and move you; there is nothing that\ntouches or stings your conscience; \u2018tis not to this they address\nthemselves.  Is not this true?  It made Aristo say, that neither a bath\nnor a lecture did aught unless it scoured and made men clean.  One may\nstop at the skin; but it is after the marrow is picked out as, after we\nhave swallowed good wine out of a fine cup, we examine the designs and\nworkmanship.  In all the courts of ancient philosophy, this is to be\nfound, that the same teacher publishes rules of temperance and at the\nsame time lessons in love and wantonness; Xenophon, in the very bosom of\nClinias, wrote against the Aristippic virtue.  \u2018Tis not that there is any\nmiraculous conversion in it that makes them thus wavering; \u2018tis that\nSolon represents himself, sometimes in his own person, and sometimes in\nthat of a legislator; one while he speaks for the crowd, and another for\nhimself; taking the free and natural rules for his own share, feeling\nassured of a firm and entire health:\n\n          \u201cCurentur dubii medicis majoribus aegri.\u201d\n\n          [\u201cDesperate maladies require the best doctors.\u201d\n           --Juvenal, xiii. 124.]\n\nAntisthenes allows a sage to love, and to do whatever he thinks\nconvenient, without regard to the laws, forasmuch as he is better advised\nthan they, and has a greater knowledge of virtue.  His disciple Diogenes\nsaid, that \u201cmen to perturbations were to oppose reason: to fortune,\ncourage: to the laws, nature.\u201d  For tender stomachs, constrained and\nartificial recipes must be prescribed: good and strong stomachs serve\nthemselves simply with the prescriptions of their own natural appetite;\nafter this manner do our physicians proceed, who eat melons and drink\niced wines, whilst they confine their patients to syrups and sops.\n\u201cI know not,\u201d said the courtezan Lais, \u201cwhat they may talk of books,\nwisdom, and philosophy; but these men knock as often at my door as any\nothers.\u201d  At the same rate that our licence carries us beyond what is\nlawful and allowed, men have, often beyond universal reason, stretched\nthe precepts and rules of our life:\n\n          \u201cNemo satis credit tantum delinquere, quantum\n          Permittas.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cNo one thinks he has done ill to the full extent of what he may.\u201d\n      --Juvenal, xiv. 233.]\n\nIt were to be wished that there was more proportion betwixt the command\nand the obedience; and the mark seems to be unjust to which one cannot\nattain.  There is no so good man, who so squares all his thoughts and\nactions to the laws, that he is not faulty enough to deserve hanging ten\ntimes in his life; and he may well be such a one, as it were great\ninjustice and great harm to punish and ruin:\n\n                              \u201cOle, quid ad te\n               De cute quid faciat ille vel ille sua?\u201d\n\n     [\u201cOlus, what is it to thee what he or she does with their skin?\u201d\n      --Martial, vii. 9, I.]\n\nand such an one there may be, who has no way offended the laws, who,\nnevertheless, would not deserve the character of a virtuous man, and whom\nphilosophy would justly condemn to be whipped; so unequal and perplexed\nis this relation.  We are so far from being good men, according to the\nlaws of God, that we cannot be so according to our own human wisdom never\nyet arrived at the duties it had itself prescribed; and could it arrive\nthere, it would still prescribe to itself others beyond, to which it\nwould ever aspire and pretend; so great an enemy to consistency is our\nhuman condition.  Man enjoins himself to be necessarily in fault: he is\nnot very discreet to cut out his own duty by the measure of another being\nthan his own.  To whom does he prescribe that which he does not expect\nany one should perform? is he unjust in not doing what it is impossible\nfor him to do?  The laws which condemn us not to be able, condemn us for\nnot being able.\n\nAt the worst, this difform liberty of presenting ourselves two several\nways, the actions after one manner and the reasoning after another, may\nbe allowed to those who only speak of things; but it cannot be allowed to\nthose who speak of themselves, as I do: I must march my pen as I do my\nfeet.  Common life ought to have relation to the other lives: the virtue\nof Cato was vigorous beyond the reason of the age he lived in; and for a\nman who made it his business to govern others, a man dedicated to the\npublic service, it might be called a justice, if not unjust, at least\nvain and out of season.  Even my own manners, which differ not above an\ninch from those current amongst us, render me, nevertheless, a little\nrough and unsociable at my age.  I know not whether it be without reason\nthat I am disgusted with the world I frequent; but I know very well that\nit would be without reason, should I complain of its being disgusted with\nme, seeing I am so with it.  The virtue that is assigned to the affairs\nof the world is a virtue of many wavings, corners, and elbows, to join\nand adapt itself to human frailty, mixed and artificial, not straight,\nclear, constant, nor purely innocent.  Our annals to this very day\nreproach one of our kings for suffering himself too simply to be carried\naway by the conscientious persuasions of his confessor: affairs of state\nhave bolder precepts;\n\n                                   \u201cExeat aula,\n                         Qui vult esse pius.\u201d\n\n          [\u201cLet him who will be pious retire from the court.\u201d\n           --Lucan, viii. 493]\n\nI formerly tried to employ in the service of public affairs opinions and\nrules of living, as rough, new, unpolished or unpolluted, as they were\neither born with me, or brought away from my education, and wherewith I\nserve my own turn, if not so commodiously, at least securely, in my own\nparticular concerns: a scholastic and novice virtue; but I have found\nthem unapt and dangerous.  He who goes into a crowd must now go one way\nand then another, keep his elbows close, retire or advance, and quit the\nstraight way, according to what he encounters; and must live not so much\naccording to his own method as to that of others; not according to what\nhe proposes to himself, but according to what is proposed to him,\naccording to the time, according to the men, according to the occasions.\nPlato says, that whoever escapes from the world\u2019s handling with clean\nbreeches, escapes by miracle: and says withal, that when he appoints his\nphilosopher the head of a government, he does not mean a corrupt one like\nthat of Athens, and much less such a one as this of ours, wherein wisdom\nitself would be to seek.  A good herb, transplanted into a soil contrary\nto its own nature, much sooner conforms itself to the soil than it\nreforms the soil to it.  I found that if I had wholly to apply myself to\nsuch employments, it would require a great deal of change and new\nmodelling in me before I could be any way fit for it: And though I could\nso far prevail upon myself (and why might I not with time and diligence\nwork such a feat), I would not do it.  The little trial I have had of\npublic employment has been so much disgust to me; I feel at times\ntemptations toward ambition rising in my soul, but I obstinately oppose\nthem:\n\n               \u201cAt tu, Catulle, obstinatus obdura.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cBut thou, Catullus, be obstinately firm.\u201d--Catullus, viii. 19.]\n\nI am seldom called to it, and as seldom offer myself uncalled; liberty\nand laziness, the qualities most predominant in me, are qualities\ndiametrically contrary to that trade.  We cannot well distinguish the\nfaculties of men; they have divisions and limits hard and delicate to\nchoose; to conclude from the discreet conduct of a private life a\ncapacity for the management of public affairs is to conclude ill; a man\nmay govern himself well who cannot govern others so, and compose Essays\nwho could not work effects: men there may be who can order a siege well,\nwho would ill marshal a battle; who can speak well in private, who would\nill harangue a people or a prince; nay, \u2018tis peradventure rather a\ntestimony in him who can do the one that he cannot do the other, than\notherwise.  I find that elevated souls are not much more proper for mean\nthings than mean souls are for high ones.  Could it be imagined that\nSocrates should have administered occasion of laughter, at the expense of\nhis own reputation, to the Athenians for: having never been able to sum\nup the votes of his tribe, to deliver it to the council?  Truly, the\nveneration I have for the perfections of this great man deserves that his\nfortune should furnish, for the excuse of my principal imperfections, so\nmagnificent an example.  Our sufficiency is cut out into small parcels;\nmine has no latitude, and is also very contemptible in number.\nSaturninus, to those who had conferred upon him the command in chief:\n\u201cCompanions,\u201d said he, \u201cyou have lost a good captain, to make of him a\nbad general.\u201d\n\nWhoever boasts, in so sick a time as this, to employ a true and sincere\nvirtue in the world\u2019s service, either knows not what it is, opinions\ngrowing corrupt with manners (and, in truth, to hear them describe it, to\nhear the most of them glorify themselves in their deportments, and lay\ndown their rules; instead of painting virtue, they paint pure vice and\ninjustice, and so represent it false in the education of princes); or if\nhe does know it, boasts unjustly and let him say what he will, does a\nthousand things of which his own conscience must necessarily accuse him.\nI should willingly take Seneca\u2019s word on the experience he made upon the\nlike occasion, provided he would deal sincerely with me.  The most\nhonourable mark of goodness in such a necessity is freely to confess both\none\u2019s own faults and those of others; with the power of its virtue to\nstay one\u2019s inclination towards evil; unwillingly to follow this\npropension; to hope better, to desire better.  I perceive that in these\ndivisions wherein we are involved in France, every one labours to defend\nhis cause; but even the very best of them with dissimulation and\ndisguise: he who would write roundly of the true state of the quarrel,\nwould write rashly and wrongly.  The most just party is at best but a\nmember of a decayed and worm-eaten body; but of such a body, the member\nthat is least affected calls itself sound, and with good reason,\nforasmuch as our qualities have no title but in comparison; civil\ninnocence is measured according to times and places.  Imagine this in\nXenophon, related as a fine commendation of Agesilaus: that, being\nentreated by a neighbouring prince with whom he had formerly had war, to\npermit him to pass through his country, he granted his request, giving\nhim free passage through Peloponnesus; and not only did not imprison or\npoison him, being at his mercy, but courteously received him according to\nthe obligation of his promise, without doing him the least injury or\noffence.  To such ideas as theirs this were an act of no especial note;\nelsewhere and in another age, the frankness and unanimity of such an\naction would be thought wonderful; our monkeyish capets\n\n     [Capets, so called from their short capes, were the students of\n     Montaigne College at Paris, and were held in great contempt.]\n\nwould have laughed at it, so little does the Spartan innocence resemble\nthat of France.  We are not without virtuous men, but \u2018tis according to\nour notions of virtue.  Whoever has his manners established in regularity\nabove the standard of the age he lives in, let him either wrest or blunt\nhis rules, or, which I would rather advise him to, let him retire, and\nnot meddle with us at all.  What will he get by it?\n\n              \u201cEgregium sanctumque virum si cerno, bimembri\n               Hoc monstrum puero, et miranti jam sub aratro\n               Piscibus inventis, et foetae comparo mulae.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cIf I see an exemplary and good man, I liken it to a two-headed\n     boy, or a fish turned up by the plough, or a teeming mule.\u201d\n      --Juvenal, xiii. 64.]\n\nOne may regret better times, but cannot fly from the present; we may wish\nfor other magistrates, but we must, notwithstanding, obey those we have;\nand, peradventure, \u2018tis more laudable to obey the bad than the good.  So\nlong as the image of the ancient and received laws of this monarchy shall\nshine in any corner of the kingdom, there will I be.  If they\nunfortunately happen to thwart and contradict one another, so as to\nproduce two parts, of doubtful and difficult choice, I will willingly\nchoose to withdraw and escape the tempest; in the meantime nature or the\nhazards of war may lend me a helping hand.  Betwixt Caesar and Pompey,\nI should frankly have declared myself; but, as amongst the three robbers\nwho came after,--[Octavius, Mark Antony, and Lepidus.]--a man must have\nbeen necessitated either to hide himself, or have gone along with the\ncurrent of the time, which I think one may fairly do when reason no\nlonger guides:\n\n                         \u201cQuo diversus abis?\u201d\n\n          [\u201cWhither dost thou run wandering?\u201d--AEneid, v. 166.]\n\nThis medley is a little from my theme; I go out of my way; but \u2018tis\nrather by licence than oversight; my fancies follow one another, but\nsometimes at a great distance, and look towards one another, but \u2018tis\nwith an oblique glance.  I have read a dialogue of Plato,--[The\nPhaedrus.]--of the like motley and fantastic composition, the beginning\nabout love, and all the rest to the end about rhetoric; they fear not\nthese variations, and have a marvellous grace in letting themselves be\ncarried away at the pleasure of the wind, or at least to seem as if they\nwere.  The titles of my chapters do not always comprehend the whole\nmatter; they often denote it by some mark only, as these others, Andria,\nEunuchus; or these, Sylla, Cicero, Toyquatus.  I love a poetic progress,\nby leaps and skips; \u2018tis an art, as Plato says, light, nimble, demoniac.\nThere are pieces in Plutarch where he forgets his theme; where the\nproposition of his argument is only found by incidence, stuffed and half\nstifled in foreign matter.  Observe his footsteps in the Daemon of\nSocrates.  O God!  how beautiful are these frolicsome sallies, those\nvariations and digressions, and all the more when they seem most\nfortuitous and careless.  \u2018Tis the indiligent reader who loses my\nsubject, and not I; there will always be found some word or other in a\ncorner that is to the purpose, though it lie very close.  I ramble\nindiscreetly and tumultuously; my style and my wit wander at the same\nrate.  He must fool it a little who would not be deemed wholly a fool,\nsay both the precepts, and, still more, the examples of our masters.  A\nthousand poets flag and languish after a prosaic manner; but the best old\nprose (and I strew it here up and down indifferently for verse) shines\nthroughout with the lustre, vigour, and boldness of poetry, and not\nwithout some air of its fury.  And certainly prose ought to have the\npre-eminence in speaking.  The poet, says Plato, seated upon the muses\ntripod, pours out with fury whatever comes into his mouth, like the pipe\nof a fountain, without considering and weighing it; and things escape him\nof various colours, of contrary substance, and with an irregular torrent.\nPlato himself is throughout poetical; and the old theology, as the\nlearned tell us, is all poetry; and the first philosophy is the original\nlanguage of the gods.  I would have my matter distinguish itself; it\nsufficiently shows where it changes, where it concludes, where it begins,\nand where it rejoins, without interlacing it with words of connection\nintroduced for the relief of weak or negligent ears, and without\nexplaining myself.  Who is he that had not rather not be read at all than\nafter a drowsy or cursory manner?\n\n             \u201cNihil est tam utile, quod intransitu prosit.\u201d\n\n          [\u201cNothing is so useful as that which is cursorily so.\u201d\n           --Seneca, Ep., 2.]\n\nIf to take books in hand were to learn them: to look upon them were to\nconsider them: and to run these slightly over were to grasp them, I were\nthen to blame to make myself out so ignorant as I say I am.  Seeing I\ncannot fix the attention of my reader by the weight of what I write,\n\u2018manco male\u2019, if I should chance to do it by my intricacies.  \u201cNay, but\nhe will afterwards repent that he ever perplexed himself about it.\u201d\n \u2018Tis very true, but he will yet be there perplexed.  And, besides, there\nare some humours in which comprehension produces disdain; who will think\nbetter of me for not understanding what I say, and will conclude the\ndepth of my sense by its obscurity; which, to speak in good sooth, I\nmortally hate, and would avoid it if I could.  Aristotle boasts somewhere\nin his writings that he affected it: a vicious affectation.  The frequent\nbreaks into chapters that I made my method in the beginning of my book,\nhaving since seemed to me to dissolve the attention before it was raised,\nas making it disdain to settle itself to so little, I, upon that account,\nhave made them longer, such as require proposition and assigned leisure.\nIn such an employment, to whom you will not give an hour you give\nnothing; and you do nothing for him for whom you only do it whilst you\nare doing something else.  To which may be added that I have,\nperadventure, some particular obligation to speak only by halves, to\nspeak confusedly and discordantly.  I am therefore angry at this\ntrouble-feast reason, and its extravagant projects that worry one\u2019s life,\nand its opinions, so fine and subtle, though they be all true, I think\ntoo dear bought and too inconvenient.  On the contrary, I make it my\nbusiness to bring vanity itself in repute, and folly too, if it produce\nme any pleasure; and let myself follow my own natural inclinations,\nwithout carrying too strict a hand upon them.\n\nI have seen elsewhere houses in ruins, and statues both of gods and men:\nthese are men still.  \u2018Tis all true; and yet, for all that, I cannot so\noften revisit the tomb of that so great and so puissant city,--[Rome]--\nthat I do not admire and reverence it.  The care of the dead is\nrecommended to us; now, I have been bred up from my infancy with these\ndead; I had knowledge of the affairs of Rome long before I had any of\nthose of my own house; I knew the Capitol and its plan before I knew the\nLouvre, and the Tiber before I knew the Seine.  The qualities and\nfortunes of Lucullus, Metellus, and Scipio have ever run more in my head\nthan those of any of my own country; they are all dead; so is my father\nas absolutely dead as they, and is removed as far from me and life in\neighteen years as they are in sixteen hundred: whose memory,\nnevertheless, friendship and society, I do not cease to embrace and\nutilise with a perfect and lively union.  Nay, of my own inclination, I\npay more service to the dead; they can no longer help themselves, and\ntherefore, methinks, the more require my assistance: \u2018tis there that\ngratitude appears in its full lustre.  The benefit is not so generously\nbestowed, where there is retrogradation and reflection.  Arcesilaus,\ngoing to visit Ctesibius, who was sick, and finding him in a very poor\ncondition, very finely conveyed some money under his pillow, and, by\nconcealing it from him, acquitted him, moreover, from the acknowledgment\ndue to such a benefit.  Such as have merited from me friendship and\ngratitude have never lost these by being no more; I have better and more\ncarefully paid them when gone and ignorant of what I did; I speak most\naffectionately of my friends when they can no longer know it.  I have had\na hundred quarrels in defending Pompey and for the cause of Brutus; this\nacquaintance yet continues betwixt us; we have no other hold even on\npresent things but by fancy.  Finding myself of no use to this age, I\nthrow myself back upon that other, and am so enamoured of it, that the\nfree, just, and flourishing state of that ancient Rome (for I neither\nlove it in its birth nor its old age) interests and impassionates me;\nand therefore I cannot so often revisit the sites of their streets and\nhouses, and those ruins profound even to the Antipodes, that I am not\ninterested in them.  Is it by nature, or through error of fancy, that the\nsight of places which we know to have been frequented and inhabited by\npersons whose memories are recommended in story, moves us in some sort\nmore than to hear a recital of their--acts or to read their writings?\n\n     \u201cTanta vis admonitionis inest in locis....Et id quidem in hac urbe\n     infinitum; quacumque enim ingredimur, in aliquam historiam vestigium\n     ponimus.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cSo great a power of reminiscence resides in places; and that truly\n     in this city infinite, for which way soever we go, we find the\n     traces of some story.\u201d--Cicero, De Fin., v. I, 2.]\n\nIt pleases me to consider their face, bearing, and vestments: I pronounce\nthose great names betwixt my teeth, and make them ring in my ears:\n\n     \u201cEgo illos veneror, et tantis nominibus semper assurgo.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cI reverence them, and always rise to so great names.\u201d\n      --Seneca, Ep., 64.]\n\nOf things that are in some part great and admirable, I admire even the\ncommon parts: I could wish to see them in familiar relations, walk, and\nsup.  It were ingratitude to contemn the relics and images of so many\nworthy and valiant men as I have seen live and die, and who, by their\nexample, give us so many good instructions, knew we how to follow them.\n\nAnd, moreover, this very Rome that we now see, deserves to be beloved, so\nlong and by so many titles allied to our crown; the only common and\nuniversal city; the sovereign magistrate that commands there is equally\nacknowledged elsewhere \u2018tis the metropolitan city of all the Christian\nnations the Spaniard and Frenchman is there at home: to be a prince of\nthat state, there needs no more but to be of Christendom wheresoever.\nThere is no place upon earth that heaven has embraced with such an\ninfluence and constancy of favour; her very ruins are grand and glorious,\n\n                \u201cLaudandis pretiosior ruinis.\u201d\n\n          [\u201cMore precious from her glorious ruins.\u201d\n           --Sidonius Apollinaris, Carm., xxiii.; Narba, v. 62.]\n\nshe yet in her very tomb retains the marks and images of empire:\n\n          \u201cUt palam sit, uno in loco gaudentis opus esse naturx.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThat it may be manifest that there is in one place the work of\n     rejoicing nature.\u201d--Pliny, Nat. Hist., iii. 5.]\n\nSome would blame and be angry at themselves to perceive themselves\ntickled with so vain a pleasure our humours are never too vain that are\npleasant let them be what they may, if they constantly content a man of\ncommon understanding, I could not have the heart to blame him.\n\nI am very much obliged to Fortune, in that, to this very hour, she has\noffered me no outrage beyond what I was well able to bear.  Is it not her\ncustom to let those live in quiet by whom she is not importuned?\n\n                   \u201cQuanto quisque sibi plum negaverit,\n                    A diis plum feret: nil cupientium\n                    Nudus castra peto .  .  .  .\n                    Multa petentibus\n                    Desunt multa.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThe more each man denies himself, the more the gods give him.\n     Poor as I am, I seek the company of those who ask nothing; they who\n     desire much will be deficient in much.\u201d\n      --Horace, Od., iii. 16,21,42.]\n\nIf she continue her favour, she will dismiss me very well satisfied:\n\n                                   \u201cNihil supra\n                         Deos lacesso.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cI trouble the gods no farther.\u201d--Horace, Od., ii. 18, 11.]\n\nBut beware a shock: there are a thousand who perish in the port.\nI easily comfort myself for what shall here happen when I shall be gone,\npresent things trouble me enough:\n\n                       \u201cFortunae caetera mando.\u201d\n\n          [\u201cI leave the rest to fortune.\u201d--Ovid, Metam., ii. 140.]\n\nBesides, I have not that strong obligation that they say ties men to the\nfuture, by the issue that succeeds to their name and honour; and\nperadventure, ought less to covet them, if they are to be so much\ndesired.  I am but too much tied to the world, and to this life, of\nmyself: I am content to be in Fortune\u2019s power by circumstances properly\nnecessary to my being, without otherwise enlarging her jurisdiction over\nme; and have never thought that to be without children was a defect that\nought to render life less complete or less contented: a sterile vocation\nhas its conveniences too.  Children are of the number of things that are\nnot so much to be desired, especially now that it would be so hard to\nmake them good:\n\n      \u201cBona jam nec nasci licet, ita corrupta Bunt semina;\u201d\n\n     [\u201cNothing good can be born now, the seed is so corrupt.\u201d\n      --Tertullian, De Pudicita.]\n\nand yet they are justly to be lamented by such as lose them when they\nhave them.\n\nHe who left me my house in charge, foretold that I was like to ruin it,\nconsidering my humour so little inclined to look after household affairs.\nBut he was mistaken; for I am in the same condition now as when I first\nentered into it, or rather somewhat better; and yet without office or any\nplace of profit.\n\nAs to the rest, if Fortune has never done me any violent or extraordinary\ninjury, neither has she done me any particular favour; whatever we derive\nfrom her bounty, was there above a hundred years before my time: I have,\nas to my own particular, no essential and solid good, that I stand\nindebted for to her liberality.  She has, indeed, done me some airy\nfavours, honorary and titular favours, without substance, and those in\ntruth she has not granted, but offered me, who, God knows, am all\nmaterial, and who take nothing but what is real, and indeed massive too,\nfor current pay: and who, if I durst confess so much, should not think\navarice much less excusable than ambition: nor pain less to be avoided\nthan shame; nor health less to be coveted than learning, or riches than\nnobility.\n\nAmongst those empty favours of hers, there is none that so much pleases\nvain humour natural to my country, as an authentic bull of a Roman\nburgess-ship, that was granted me when I was last there, glorious in\nseals and gilded letters, and granted with all gracious liberality.  And\nbecause \u2018tis couched in a mixt style, more or less favourable, and that I\ncould have been glad to have seen a copy of it before it had passed the\nseal.\n\nBeing before burgess of no city at all, I am glad to be created one of\nthe most noble that ever was or ever shall be.  If other men would\nconsider themselves at the rate I do, they would, as I do, discover\nthemselves to be full of inanity and foppery; to rid myself of it, I\ncannot, without making myself away.  We are all steeped in it, as well\none as another; but they who are not aware on\u2019t, have somewhat the better\nbargain; and yet I know not whether they have or no.\n\nThis opinion and common usage to observe others more than ourselves has\nvery much relieved us that way: \u2018tis a very displeasing object: we can\nthere see nothing but misery and vanity: nature, that we may not be\ndejected with the sight of our own deformities, has wisely thrust the\naction of seeing outward.  We go forward with the current, but to turn\nback towards ourselves is a painful motion; so is the sea moved and\ntroubled when the waves rush against one another.  Observe, says every\none, the motions of the heavens, of public affairs; observe the quarrel\nof such a person, take notice of such a one\u2019s pulse, of such another\u2019s\nlast will and testament; in sum, be always looking high or low, on one\nside, before or behind you.  It was a paradoxical command anciently given\nus by that god of Delphos: \u201cLook into yourself; discover yourself; keep\nclose to yourself; call back your mind and will, that elsewhere consume\nthemselves into yourself; you run out, you spill yourself; carry a more\nsteady hand: men betray you, men spill you, men steal you from yourself.\nDost thou not see that this world we live in keeps all its sight confined\nwithin, and its eyes open to contemplate itself?  \u2018Tis always vanity for\nthee, both within and without; but \u2018tis less vanity when less extended.\nExcepting thee, O man, said that god, everything studies itself first,\nand has bounds to its labours and desires, according to its need.  There\nis nothing so empty and necessitous as thou, who embracest the universe;\nthou art the investigator without knowledge, the magistrate without\njurisdiction, and, after all, the fool of the farce.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n     ETEXT EDITOR\u2019S BOOKMARKS:\n\n     A man may govern himself well who cannot govern others so\n     A man should diffuse joy, but, as much as he can, smother grief\n     A well-bred man is a compound man\n     All over-nice solicitude about riches smells of avarice\n     Always complaining is the way never to be lamented\n     Appetite comes to me in eating\n     Better to be alone than in foolish and troublesome company\n     By suspecting them, have given them a title to do ill\n     Change only gives form to injustice and tyranny\n     Civil innocence is measured according to times and places\n     Conclude the depth of my sense by its obscurity\n     Concluding no beauty can be greater than what they see\n     Confession enervates reproach and disarms slander\n     Counterfeit condolings of pretenders\n     Crates did worse, who threw himself into the liberty of poverty\n     Desire of travel\n     Enough to do to comfort myself, without having to console others\n     Friend, it is not now time to play with your nails\n     Gain to change an ill condition for one that is uncertain\n     Giving is an ambitious and authoritative quality\n     Good does not necessarily succeed evil; another evil may succeed\n     Greedy humour of new and unknown things\n     He must fool it a little who would not be deemed wholly a fool\n     I always find superfluity superfluous\n     I am disgusted with the world I frequent\n     I am hard to be got out, but being once upon the road\n     I am very willing to quit the government of my house\n     I content myself with enjoying the world without bustle\n     I enter into confidence with dying\n     I grudge nothing but care and trouble\n     I hate poverty equally with pain\n     I scorn to mend myself by halves\n     I write my book for few men and for few years\n     Justice als takes cognisance of those who glean after the reaper\n     Known evil was ever more supportable than one that was, new\n     Laws (of Plato on travel), which forbids it after threescore.\n     Liberty and laziness, the qualities most predominant in me\n     Liberty of poverty\n     Liberty to lean, but not to lay our whole weight upon others\n     Little affairs most disturb us\n     Men as often commend as undervalue me beyond reason\n     Methinks I promise it, if I but say it\n     My mind is easily composed at distance\n     Neither be a burden to myself nor to any other\n     No use to this age, I throw myself back upon that other\n     Nothing falls where all falls\n     Nothing presses so hard upon a state as innovation\n     Obstinate in growing worse\n     Occupy our thoughts about the general, and about universal cause\n     One may regret better times, but cannot fly from the present\n     Opposition and contradiction entertain and nourish them\n     Our qualities have no title but in comparison\n     Preferring the universal and common tie to all national ties\n     Proceed so long as there shall be ink and paper in the world\n     Satisfied and pleased with and in themselves\n     Settled my thoughts to live upon less than I have\n     Some wives covetous indeed, but very few that are good managers\n     That looks a nice well-made shoe to you\n     There can be no pleasure to me without communication\n     Think myself no longer worth my own care\n     Tis for youth to subject itself to common opinions\n     Tis more laudable to obey the bad than the good\n     Titles of my chapters do not always comprehend the whole matter\n     Travel with not only a necessary, but a handsome equipage\n     Turn up my eyes to heaven to return thanks, than to crave\n     Weigh, as wise: men should, the burden of obligation\n     What sort of wine he liked the best: \u201cThat of another,\u201d\n      What step ends the near and what step begins the remote\n     When I travel I have nothing to care for but myself\n     Wise man to keep a curbing hand upon the impetus of friendship\n     World where loyalty of one\u2019s own children is unknown\n     Wretched and dangerous thing to depend upon others\n     You have lost a good captain, to make of him a bad general\n\n\n\n\n\n\nESSAYS OF MICHEL DE MONTAIGNE\n\nTranslated by Charles Cotton\n\nEdited by William Carew Hazlitt\n\n1877\n\n\n\n\nCONTENTS OF VOLUME 18.\n\nX.

Of Physiognomy.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nOF MANAGING THE WILL\n\nFew things, in comparison of what commonly affect other men, move, or, to\nsay better, possess me: for \u2018tis but reason they should concern a man,\nprovided they do not possess him.  I am very solicitous, both by study\nand argument, to enlarge this privilege of insensibility, which is in me\nnaturally raised to a pretty degree, so that consequently I espouse and\nam very much moved with very few things.  I have a clear sight enough,\nbut I fix it upon very few objects; I have a sense delicate and tender\nenough; but an apprehension and application hard and negligent.  I am\nvery unwilling to engage myself; as much as in me lies, I employ myself\nwholly on myself, and even in that subject should rather choose to curb\nand restrain my affection from plunging itself over head and ears into\nit, it being a subject that I possess at the mercy of others, and over\nwhich fortune has more right than I; so that even as to health, which I\nso much value, \u2018tis all the more necessary for me not so passionately to\ncovet and heed it, than to find diseases so insupportable.  A man ought\nto moderate himself betwixt the hatred of pain and the love of pleasure:\nand Plato sets down a middle path of life betwixt the two.  But against\nsuch affections as wholly carry me away from myself and fix me elsewhere,\nagainst those, I say, I oppose myself with my utmost power.  \u2018Tis my\nopinion that a man should lend himself to others, and only give himself\nto himself.  Were my will easy to lend itself out and to be swayed, I\nshould not stick there; I am too tender both by nature and use:\n\n            \u201cFugax rerum, securaque in otia natus.\u201d\n\n          [\u201cAvoiding affairs and born to secure ease.\u201d\n           --Ovid, De Trist., iii. 2, 9.]\n\nHot and obstinate disputes, wherein my adversary would at last have the\nbetter, the issue that would render my heat and obstinacy disgraceful\nwould peradventure vex me to the last degree.  Should I set myself to it\nat the rate that others do, my soul would never have the force to bear\nthe emotion and alarms of those who grasp at so much; it would\nimmediately be disordered by this inward agitation.  If, sometimes, I\nhave been put upon the management of other men\u2019s affairs, I have promised\nto take them in hand, but not into my lungs and liver; to take them upon\nme, not to incorporate them; to take pains, yes: to be impassioned about\nit, by no means; I have a care of them, but I will not sit upon them.\nI have enough to do to order and govern the domestic throng of those that\nI have in my own veins and bowels, without introducing a crowd of other\nmen\u2019s affairs; and am sufficiently concerned about my own proper and\nnatural business, without meddling with the concerns of others.  Such as\nknow how much they owe to themselves, and how many offices they are bound\nto of their own, find that nature has cut them out work enough of their\nown to keep them from being idle.  \u201cThou hast business enough at home:\nlook to that.\u201d\n\nMen let themselves out to hire; their faculties are not for themselves,\nbut for those to whom they have enslaved themselves; \u2018tis their tenants\noccupy them, not themselves.  This common humour pleases not me.  We must\nbe thrifty of the liberty of our souls, and never let it out but upon\njust occasions, which are very few, if we judge aright.  Do but observe\nsuch as have accustomed themselves to be at every one\u2019s call: they do it\nindifferently upon all, as well little as great, occasions; in that which\nnothing concerns them; as much as in what imports them most.  They thrust\nthemselves in indifferently wherever there is work to do and obligation,\nand are without life when not in tumultuous bustle:\n\n                    \u201cIn negotiis sunt, negotii cause,\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThey are in business for business\u2019 sake.\u201d--Seneca, Ep., 22.]\n\nIt is not so much that they will go, as it is that they cannot stand\nstill: like a rolling stone that cannot stop till it can go no further.\nOccupation, with a certain sort of men, is a mark of understanding and\ndignity: their souls seek repose in agitation, as children do by being\nrocked in a cradle; they may pronounce themselves as serviceable to their\nfriends, as they are troublesome to themselves.  No one distributes his\nmoney to others, but every one distributes his time and his life: there\nis nothing of which we are so prodigal as of these two things, of which\nto be thrifty would be both commendable and useful.  I am of a quite\ncontrary humour; I look to myself, and commonly covet with no great\nardour what I do desire, and desire little; and I employ and busy myself\nat the same rate, rarely and temperately.  Whatever they take in hand,\nthey do it with their utmost will and vehemence.  There are so many\ndangerous steps, that, for the more safety, we must a little lightly and\nsuperficially glide over the world, and not rush through it.  Pleasure\nitself is painful in profundity:\n\n                              \u201cIncedis per ignes,\n                    Suppositos cineri doloso.\u201d\n\n          [\u201cYou tread on fire, hidden under deceitful ashes.\u201d\n           --Horace, Od., ii. i, 7.]\n\nThe Parliament of Bordeaux chose me mayor of their city at a time when I\nwas at a distance from France,--[At Bagno Della Villa, near Lucca,\nSeptember 1581]--and still more remote from any such thought.\nI entreated to be excused, but I was told by my friends that I had\ncommitted an error in so doing, and the greater because the king had,\nmoreover, interposed his command in that affair.  \u2018Tis an office that\nought to be looked upon so much more honourable, as it has no other\nsalary nor advantage than the bare honour of its execution.  It continues\ntwo years, but may be extended by a second election, which very rarely\nhappens; it was to me, and had never been so but twice before: some years\nago to Monsieur de Lansac, and lately to Monsieur de Biron, Marshal of\nFrance, in whose place I succeeded; and, I left mine to Monsieur de\nMatignon, Marshal of France also: proud of so noble a fraternity--\n\n               \u201cUterque bonus pacis bellique minister.\u201d\n\n          [\u201cEither one a good minister in peace and war.\u201d\n           --AEneid, xi. 658.]\n\nFortune would have a hand in my promotion, by this particular\ncircumstance which she put in of her own, not altogether vain; for\nAlexander disdained the ambassadors of Corinth, who came to offer him a\nburgess-ship of their city; but when they proceeded to lay before him\nthat Bacchus and Hercules were also in the register, he graciously\nthanked them.\n\nAt my arrival, I faithfully and conscientiously represented myself to\nthem for such as I find myself to be--a man without memory, without\nvigilance, without experience, and without vigour; but withal, without\nhatred, without ambition, without avarice, and without violence; that\nthey might be informed of my qualities, and know what they were to expect\nfrom my service.  And whereas the knowledge they had had of my late\nfather, and the honour they had for his memory, had alone incited them to\nconfer this favour upon me, I plainly told them that I should be very\nsorry anything should make so great an impression upon me as their\naffairs and the concerns of their city had made upon him, whilst he held\nthe government to which they had preferred me.  I remembered, when a boy,\nto have seen him in his old age cruelly tormented with these public\naffairs, neglecting the soft repose of his own house, to which the\ndeclension of his age had reduced him for several years before, the\nmanagement of his own affairs, and his health; and certainly despising\nhis own life, which was in great danger of being lost, by being engaged\nin long and painful journeys on their behalf.  Such was he; and this\nhumour of his proceeded from a marvellous good nature; never was there a\nmore charitable and popular soul.  Yet this proceeding which I commend in\nothers, I do not love to follow myself, and am not without excuse.\n\nHe had learned that a man must forget himself for his neighbour, and that\nthe particular was of no manner of consideration in comparison with the\ngeneral.  Most of the rules and precepts of the world run this way; to\ndrive us out of ourselves into the street for the benefit of public\nsociety; they thought to do a great feat to divert and remove us from\nourselves, assuming we were but too much fixed there, and by a too\nnatural inclination; and have said all they could to that purpose: for\n\u2018tis no new thing for the sages to preach things as they serve, not as\nthey are.  Truth has its obstructions, inconveniences, and\nincompatibilities with us; we must often deceive that we may not deceive\nourselves; and shut our eyes and our understandings to redress and amend\nthem:\n\n          \u201cImperiti enim judicant, et qui frequenter\n          in hoc ipsum fallendi sunt, ne errent.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cFor the ignorant judge, and therefore are oft to be deceived,\n     less they should err.\u201d--Quintil., Inst. Orat., xi. 17.]\n\nWhen they order us to love three, four, or fifty degrees of things above\nourselves,  they do like archers, who, to hit the white, take their aim a\ngreat deal higher than the butt; to make a crooked stick straight, we\nbend it the contrary way.\n\nI believe that in the Temple of Pallas, as we see in all other religions,\nthere were apparent mysteries to be exposed to the people; and others,\nmore secret and high, that were only to be shown to such as were\nprofessed; \u2018tis likely that in these the true point of friendship that\nevery one owes to himself is to be found; not a false friendship, that\nmakes us embrace glory, knowledge, riches, and the like, with a principal\nand immoderate affection, as members of our being; nor an indiscreet and\neffeminate friendship, wherein it happens, as with ivy, that it decays\nand ruins the walls it embraces; but a sound and regular friendship,\nequally useful and pleasant.  He who knows the duties of this friendship\nand practises them is truly of the cabinet of the Muses, and has attained\nto the height of human wisdom and of our happiness, such an one, exactly\nknowing what he owes to himself, will on his part find that he ought to\napply to himself the use of the world and of other men; and to do this,\nto contribute to public society the duties and offices appertaining to\nhim.  He who does not in some sort live for others, does not live much\nfor himself:\n\n     \u201cQui sibi amicus est, scito hunc amicum omnibus esse.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cHe who is his own friend, is a friend to everybody else.\u201d\n      --Seneca, Ep., 6.]\n\nThe principal charge we have is, to every one his own conduct; and \u2018tis\nfor this only that we here are.  As he who should forget to live a\nvirtuous and holy life, and should think he acquitted himself of his duty\nin instructing and training others up to it, would be a fool; even so he\nwho abandons his own particular healthful and pleasant living to serve\nothers therewith, takes, in my opinion, a wrong and unnatural course.\n\nI would not that men should refuse, in the employments they take upon\nthem, their attention, pains, eloquence, sweat, and blood if need be:\n\n                         \u201cNon ipse pro caris amicis\n                    Aut patria, timidus perire:\u201d\n\n     [\u201cHimself not afraid to die for beloved friends, or for his\n     country.\u201d--Horace, Od., iv. 9, 51.]\n\nbut \u2018tis only borrowed, and accidentally; his mind being always in repose\nand in health; not without action, but without vexation, without passion.\nTo be simply acting costs him so little, that he acts even sleeping;\nbut it must be set on going with discretion; for the body receives the\noffices imposed upon it just according to what they are; the mind often\nextends and makes them heavier at its own expense, giving them what\nmeasure it pleases.  Men perform like things with several sorts of\nendeavour, and different contention of will; the one does well enough\nwithout the other; for how many people hazard themselves every day in war\nwithout any concern which way it goes; and thrust themselves into the\ndangers of battles, the loss of which will not break their next night\u2019s\nsleep? and such a man may be at home, out of the danger which he durst\nnot have looked upon, who is more passionately concerned for the issue of\nthis war, and whose soul is more anxious about events than the soldier\nwho therein stakes his blood and his life.  I could have engaged myself\nin public employments without quitting my own matters a nail\u2019s breadth,\nand have given myself to others without abandoning myself.  This\nsharpness and violence of desires more hinder than they advance the\nexecution of what we undertake; fill us with impatience against slow or\ncontrary events, and with heat and suspicion against those with whom we\nhave to do.  We never carry on that thing well by which we are\nprepossessed and led:\n\n                         \u201cMale cuncta ministrat\n                         Impetus.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cImpulse manages all things ill.\u201d--Statius, Thebaid, x. 704.]\n\nHe who therein employs only his judgment and address proceeds more\ncheerfully: he counterfeits, he gives way, he defers quite at his ease,\naccording to the necessities of occasions; he fails in his attempt\nwithout trouble and affliction, ready and entire for a new enterprise;\nhe always marches with the bridle in his hand.  In him who is intoxicated\nwith this violent and tyrannical intention, we discover, of necessity,\nmuch imprudence and injustice; the impetuosity of his desire carries him\naway; these are rash motions, and, if fortune do not very much assist,\nof very little fruit.  Philosophy directs that, in the revenge of\ninjuries received, we should strip ourselves of choler; not that the\nchastisement should be less, but, on the contrary, that the revenge may\nbe the better and more heavily laid on, which, it conceives, will be by\nthis impetuosity hindered.  For anger not only disturbs, but, of itself,\nalso wearies the arms of those who chastise; this fire benumbs and wastes\ntheir force; as in precipitation, \u201cfestinatio tarda est,\u201d--haste trips\nup its own heels, fetters, and stops itself:\n\n               \u201cIpsa se velocitas implicat.\u201d--Seneca, Ep. 44\n\nFor example, according to what I commonly see, avarice has no greater\nimpediment than itself; the more bent and vigorous it is, the less it\nrakes together, and commonly sooner grows rich when disguised in a visor\nof liberality.\n\nA very excellent gentleman, and a friend of mine, ran a risk of impairing\nhis faculties by a too passionate attention and affection to the affairs\nof a certain prince his master;--[Probably the King of Navarre, afterward\nHenry IV.]--which master has thus portrayed himself to me; \u201cthat he\nforesees the weight of accidents as well as another, but that in those\nfor which there is no remedy, he presently resolves upon suffering; in\nothers, having taken all the necessary precautions which by the vivacity\nof his understanding he can presently do, he quietly awaits what may\nfollow.\u201d  And, in truth, I have accordingly seen him maintain a great\nindifferency and liberty of actions and serenity of countenance in very\ngreat and difficult affairs: I find him much greater, and of greater\ncapacity in adverse than in prosperous fortune; his defeats are to him\nmore glorious than his victories, and his mourning than his triumph.\n\nConsider, that even in vain and frivolous actions, as at chess, tennis,\nand the like, this eager and ardent engaging with an impetuous desire,\nimmediately throws the mind and members into indiscretion and disorder: a\nman astounds and hinders himself; he who carries himself more moderately,\nboth towards gain and loss, has always his wits about him; the less\npeevish and passionate he is at play, he plays much more advantageously\nand surely.\n\nAs to the rest, we hinder the mind\u2019s grasp and hold, in giving it so many\nthings to seize upon; some things we should only offer to it; tie it to\nothers, and with others incorporate it.  It can feel and discern all\nthings, but ought to feed upon nothing but itself; and should be\ninstructed in what properly concerns itself, and that is properly of its\nown having and substance.  The laws of nature teach us what justly we\nneed.  After the sages have told us that no one is indigent according to\nnature, and that every one is so according to opinion, they very subtly\ndistinguish betwixt the desires that proceed from her, and those that\nproceed from the disorder of our own fancy: those of which we can see the\nend are hers; those that fly before us, and of which we can see no end,\nare our own: the poverty of goods is easily cured; the poverty of the\nsoul is irreparable:\n\n         \u201cNam si, quod satis est homini, id satis esse potesset\n          Hoc sat erat: nunc, quum hoc non est, qui credimus porro\n          Divitias ullas animum mi explere potesse?\u201d\n\n     [\u201cFor if what is for man enough, could be enough, it were enough;\n     but since it is not so, how can I believe that any wealth can give\n     my mind content.\u201d--Lucilius aped Nonium Marcellinum, V. sec. 98.]\n\nSocrates, seeing a great quantity of riches, jewels, and furniture\ncarried in pomp through his city:  \u201cHow many things,\u201d said he, \u201cI do not\ndesire!\u201d--[Cicero, Tusc.  Quaes., V. 32.]--Metrodorus lived on twelve\nounces a day, Epicurus upon less; Metrocles slept in winter abroad\namongst sheep, in summer in the cloisters of churches:\n\n               \u201cSufficit ad id natura, quod poscit.\u201d\n\n          [\u201cNature suffices for what he requires.\u201d--Seneca, Ep., 90.]\n\nCleanthes lived by the labour of his own hands, and boasted that\nCleanthes, if he would, could yet maintain another Cleanthes.\n\nIf that which nature exactly and originally requires of us for the\nconservation of our being be too little (as in truth what it is, and how\ngood cheap life may be maintained, cannot be better expressed than by\nthis consideration, that it is so little that by its littleness it\nescapes the gripe and shock of fortune), let us allow ourselves a little\nmore; let us call every one of our habits and conditions nature; let us\nrate and treat ourselves by this measure; let us stretch our\nappurtenances and accounts so far; for so far, I fancy, we have some\nexcuse.  Custom is a second nature, and no less powerful.  What is\nwanting to my custom, I reckon is wanting to me; and I should be almost\nas well content that they took away my life as cut me short in the way\nwherein I have so long lived.  I am no longer in condition for any great\nchange, nor to put myself into a new and unwonted course, not even to\naugmentation.  \u2018Tis past the time for me to become other than what I am;\nand as I should complain of any great good hap that should now befall me,\nthat it came not in time to be enjoyed:\n\n               \u201cQuo mihi fortunas, si non conceditur uti?\u201d\n\n     [\u201cWhat is the good fortune to me, if it is not granted to me\n     to use it.\u201d--Horace, Ep., i. 5, 12.]\n\nso should I complain of any inward acquisition.  It were almost better\nnever, than so late, to become an honest man, and well fit to live, when\none has no longer to live.  I, who am about to make my exit out of the\nworld, would easily resign to any newcomer, who should desire it, all the\nprudence I am now acquiring in the world\u2019s commerce; after meat, mustard.\nI have no need of goods of which I can make no use; of what use is\nknowledge to him who has lost his head?  \u2018Tis an injury and unkindness in\nfortune to tender us presents that will only inspire us with a just\ndespite that we had them not in their due season.  Guide me no more; I\ncan no longer go.  Of so many parts as make up a sufficiency, patience is\nthe most sufficient.  Give the capacity of an excellent treble to the\nchorister who has rotten lungs, and eloquence to a hermit exiled into the\ndeserts of Arabia.  There needs no art to help a fall; the end finds\nitself of itself at the conclusion of every affair.  My world is at an\nend, my form expired; I am totally of the past, and am bound to authorise\nit, and to conform my outgoing to it.  I will here declare, by way of\nexample, that the Pope\u2019s late ten days\u2019 diminution\n\n     [Gregory XIII., in 1582, reformed the Calendar, and, in consequence,\n     in France they all at once passed from the 9th to the 20th\n     December.]\n\nhas taken me so aback that I cannot well reconcile myself to it; I belong\nto the years wherein we kept another kind of account.  So ancient and so\nlong a custom challenges my adherence to it, so that I am constrained to\nbe somewhat heretical on that point incapable of any, though corrective,\ninnovation.  My imagination, in spite of my teeth, always pushes me ten\ndays forward or backward, and is ever murmuring in my ears: \u201cThis rule\nconcerns those who are to begin to be.\u201d  If health itself, sweet as it\nis, returns to me by fits, \u2018tis rather to give me cause of regret than\npossession of it; I have no place left to keep it in.  Time leaves me;\nwithout which nothing can be possessed.  Oh, what little account should I\nmake of those great elective dignities that I see in such esteem in the\nworld, that are never conferred but upon men who are taking leave of it;\nwherein they do not so much regard how well the man will discharge his\ntrust, as how short his administration will be: from the very entry they\nlook at the exit.  In short, I am about finishing this man, and not\nrebuilding another.  By long use, this form is in me turned into\nsubstance, and fortune into nature.\n\nI say, therefore, that every one of us feeble creatures is excusable in\nthinking that to be his own which is comprised under this measure; but\nwithal, beyond these limits, \u2018tis nothing but confusion; \u2018tis the largest\nextent we can grant to our own claims.  The more we amplify our need and\nour possession, so much the more do we expose ourselves to the blows of\nFortune and adversities.  The career of our desires ought to be\ncircumscribed and restrained to a short limit of the nearest and most\ncontiguous commodities; and their course ought, moreover, to be performed\nnot in a right line, that ends elsewhere, but in a circle, of which the\ntwo points, by a short wheel, meet and terminate in ourselves.  Actions\nthat are carried on without this reflection--a near and essential\nreflection, I mean--such as those of ambitious and avaricious men, and so\nmany more as run point-blank, and to whose career always carries them\nbefore themselves, such actions, I say; are erroneous and sickly.\n\nMost of our business is farce:\n\n               \u201cMundus universus exercet histrioniam.\u201d\n                --[Petronius Arbiter, iii. 8.]\n\nWe must play our part properly, but withal as a part of a borrowed\npersonage; we must not make real essence of a mask and outward\nappearance; nor of a strange person, our own; we cannot distinguish the\nskin from the shirt: \u2018tis enough to meal the face, without mealing the\nbreast.  I see some who transform and transubstantiate themselves into as\nmany new shapes and new beings as they undertake new employments; and who\nstrut and fume even to the heart and liver, and carry their state along\nwith them even to the close-stool: I cannot make them distinguish the\nsalutations made to themselves from those made to their commission, their\ntrain, or their mule:\n\n     \u201cTantum se fortunx permittunt, etiam ut naturam dediscant.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThey so much give themselves up to fortune, as even to unlearn\n     nature.\u201d--Quintus Curtius, iii. 2.]\n\nThey swell and puff up their souls, and their natural way of speaking,\naccording to the height of their magisterial place.  The Mayor of\nBordeaux and Montaigne have ever been two by very manifest separation.\nBecause one is an advocate or a financier, he must not ignore the knavery\nthere is in such callings; an honest man is not accountable for the vice\nor absurdity of his employment, and ought not on that account refuse to\ntake the calling upon him: \u2018tis the usage of his country, and there is\nmoney to be got by it; a man must live by the world; and make his best of\nit, such as it is.  But the judgment of an emperor ought to be above his\nempire, and see and consider it as a foreign accident; and he ought to\nknow how to enjoy himself apart from it, and to communicate himself as\nJames and Peter, to himself, at all events.\n\nI cannot engage myself so deep and so entire; when my will gives me to\nanything, \u2018tis not with so violent an obligation that my judgment is\ninfected with it.  In the present broils of this kingdom, my own interest\nhas not made me blind to the laudable qualities of our adversaries, nor\nto those that are reproachable in those men of our party.  Others adore\nall of their own side; for my part, I do not so much as excuse most\nthings in those of mine: a good work has never the worst grace with me\nfor being made against me.  The knot of the controversy excepted, I have\nalways kept myself in equanimity and pure indifference:\n\n     \u201cNeque extra necessitates belli praecipuum odium gero;\u201d\n\n     [\u201cNor bear particular hatred beyond the necessities of war.\u201d]\n\nfor which I am pleased with myself; and the more because I see others\ncommonly fail in the contrary direction.  Such as extend their anger and\nhatred beyond the dispute in question, as most men do, show that they\nspring from some other occasion and private cause; like one who, being\ncured of an ulcer, has yet a fever remaining, by which it appears that\nthe ulcer had another more concealed beginning.  The reason is that they\nare not concerned in the common cause, because it is wounding to the\nstate and general interest; but are only nettled by reason of their\nparticular concern.  This is why they are so especially animated, and to\na degree so far beyond justice and public reason:\n\n          \u201cNon tam omnia universi, quam ea, quae ad quemque pertinent,\n          singuli carpebant.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cEvery one was not so much angry against things in general, as\n     against those that particularly concern himself.\u201d\n      --Livy, xxxiv. 36.]\n\nI would have the advantage on our side; but if it be not, I shall not run\nmad.  I am heartily for the right party; but I do not want to be taken\nnotice of as an especial enemy to others, and beyond the general quarrel.\nI marvellously challenge this vicious form of opinion: \u201cHe is of the\nLeague because he admires the graciousness of Monsieur de Guise; he is\nastonished at the King of Navarre\u2019s energy, therefore he is a Huguenot;\nhe finds this to say of the manners of the king, he is therefore\nseditious in his heart.\u201d  And I did not grant to the magistrate himself\nthat he did well in condemning a book because it had placed a heretic\n--[Theodore de Beza.]--amongst the best poets of the time.  Shall we not\ndare to say of a thief that he has a handsome leg?  If a woman be a\nstrumpet, must it needs follow that she has a foul smell?  Did they in\nthe wisest ages revoke the proud title of Capitolinus they had before\nconferred on Marcus Manlius as conservator of religion and the public\nliberty, and stifle the memory of his liberality, his feats of arms, and\nmilitary recompenses granted to his valour, because he, afterwards\naspired to the sovereignty, to the prejudice of the laws of his country?\nIf we take a hatred against an advocate, he will not be allowed the next\nday to be eloquent.  I have elsewhere spoken of the zeal that pushed on\nworthy men to the like faults.  For my part, I can say, \u201cSuch an one does\nthis thing ill, and another thing virtuously and well.\u201d  So in the\nprognostication or sinister events of affairs they would have every one\nin his party blind or a blockhead, and that our persuasion and judgment\nshould subserve not truth, but to the project of our desires.  I should\nrather incline towards the other extreme; so much I fear being suborned\nby my desire; to which may be added that I am a little tenderly\ndistrustful of things that I wish.\n\nI have in my time seen wonders in the indiscreet and prodigious facility\nof people in suffering their hopes and belief to be led and governed,\nwhich way best pleased and served their leaders, despite a hundred\nmistakes one upon another, despite mere dreams and phantasms.  I no more\nwonder at those who have been blinded and seduced by the fooleries of\nApollonius and Mahomet.  Their sense and understanding are absolutely\ntaken away by their passion; their discretion has no more any other\nchoice than that which smiles upon them and encourages their cause.\nI had principally observed this in the beginning of our intestine\ndistempers; that other, which has sprung up since, in imitating, has\nsurpassed it; by which I am satisfied that it is a quality inseparable\nfrom popular errors; after the first, that rolls, opinions drive on one\nanother like waves with the wind: a man is not a member of the body, if\nit be in his power to forsake it, and if he do not roll the common way.\nBut, doubtless, they wrong the just side when they go about to assist it\nwith fraud; I have ever been against that practice: \u2018tis only fit to work\nupon weak heads; for the sound, there are surer and more honest ways to\nkeep up their courage and to excuse adverse accidents.\n\nHeaven never saw a greater animosity than that betwixt Caesar and Pompey,\nnor ever shall; and yet I observe, methinks, in those brave souls,\na great moderation towards one another: it was a jealousy of honour and\ncommand, which did not transport them to a furious and indiscreet hatred,\nand was without malignity and detraction: in their hottest exploits upon\none another, I discover some remains of respect and good-will: and am\ntherefore of opinion that, had, it been possible, each of them would\nrather have done his business without the ruin of the other than with it.\nTake notice how much otherwise matters went with Marius and Sylla.\n\nWe must not precipitate ourselves so headlong after our affections and\ninterests.  As, when I was young, I opposed myself to the progress of\nlove which I perceived to advance too fast upon me, and had a care lest\nit should at last become so pleasing as to force, captivate, and wholly\nreduce me to its mercy: so I do the same upon all other occasions where\nmy will is running on with too warm an appetite.  I lean opposite to the\nside it inclines to; as I find it going to plunge and make itself drunk\nwith its own wine; I evade nourishing its pleasure so far, that I cannot\nrecover it without infinite loss.  Souls that, through their own\nstupidity, only discern things by halves, have this happiness, that they\nsmart less with hurtful things: \u2018tis a spiritual leprosy that has some\nshow of health, and such a health as philosophy does not altogether\ncontemn; but yet we have no reason to call it wisdom, as we often do.\nAnd after this manner some one anciently mocked Diogeries, who, in the\ndepth of winter and quite naked, went embracing an image of snow for a\ntrial of his endurance: the other seeing him in this position, \u201cArt thou\nnow very cold?\u201d  said he.  \u201cNot at all,\u201d replied Diogenes.  \u201cWhy, then,\u201d\n pursued the other, \u201cwhat difficult and exemplary thing dost thou think\nthou doest in embracing that snow?\u201d  To take a true measure of constancy,\none must necessarily know what the suffering is.\n\nBut souls that are to meet with adverse events and the injuries of\nfortune, in their depth and sharpness, that are to weigh and taste them\naccording to their natural weight and bitterness, let such show their\nskill in avoiding the causes and diverting the blow.  What did King Cotys\ndo?  He paid liberally for the rich and beautiful vessel that had been\npresented to him, but, seeing it was exceedingly brittle, he immediately\nbroke it betimes, to prevent so easy a matter of displeasure against his\nservants. In like manner, I have willingly avoided all confusion in my\naffairs, and never coveted to have my estate contiguous to those of my\nrelations, and such with whom I coveted a strict friendship; for thence\nmatter of unkindness and falling out often proceeds.  I formerly loved\nhazardous games of cards and dice; but have long since left them off,\nonly for this reason that, with whatever good air I carried my losses,\nI could not help feeling vexed within.  A man of honour, who ought to be\ntouchily sensible of the lie or of an insult, and who is not to take a\nscurvy excuse for satisfaction, should avoid occasions of dispute.\nI shun melancholy, crabbed men, as I would the plague; and in matters I\ncannot talk of without emotion and concern I never meddle, if not\ncompelled by my duty:\n\n               \u201cMelius non incipient, quam desinent.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThey had better never to begin than to have to desist.\u201d\n      --Seneca, Ep., 72.]\n\nThe surest way, therefore, is to prepare one\u2019s self beforehand for\noccasions.\n\nI know very well that some wise men have taken another way, and have not\nfeared to grapple and engage to the utmost upon several subjects these\nare confident of their own strength, under which they protect themselves\nin all ill successes, making their patience wrestle and contend with\ndisaster:\n\n               \u201cVelut rupes, vastum quae prodit in aequor,\n               Obvia ventorum furiis, expostaque ponto,\n               Vim cunctam atque minas perfert coelique marisque;\n               Ipsa immota manens.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cAs a rock, which projects into the vast ocean, exposed to the\n     furious winds and the raging sea, defies the force and menaces of\n     sky and sea, itself unshaken.\u201d--Virgil, AEneid, x. 693.]\n\nLet us not attempt these examples; we shall never come up to them.  They\nset themselves resolutely, and without agitation, to behold the ruin of\ntheir country, which possessed and commanded all their will: this is too\nmuch, and too hard a task for our commoner souls.  Cato gave up the\nnoblest life that ever was upon this account; we meaner spirits must fly\nfrom the storm as far as we can; we must provide for sentiment, and not\nfor patience, and evade the blows we cannot meet.  Zeno, seeing\nChremonides, a young man whom he loved, draw near to sit down by him,\nsuddenly started up; and Cleanthes demanding of him the reason why he did\nso, \u201cI hear,\u201d said he, \u201cthat physicians especially order repose, and\nforbid emotion in all tumours.\u201d  Socrates does not say: \u201cDo not surrender\nto the charms of beauty; stand your ground, and do your utmost to oppose\nit.\u201d  \u201cFly it,\u201d says he; \u201cshun the fight and encounter of it, as of a\npowerful poison that darts and wounds at a distance.\u201d  And his good\ndisciple, feigning or reciting, but, in my opinion, rather reciting than\nfeigning, the rare perfections of the great Cyrus, makes him distrustful\nof his own strength to resist the charms of the divine beauty of that\nillustrous Panthea, his captive, and committing the visiting and keeping\nher to another, who could not have so much liberty as himself.  And the\nHoly Ghost in like manner:\n\n                    \u201cNe nos inducas in tentationem.\u201d\n\n          [\u201cLead us not into temptation.\u201d--St. Matthew, vi. 13.]\n\nWe do not pray that our reason may not be combated and overcome by\nconcupiscence, but that it should not be so much as tried by it; that we\nshould not be brought into a state wherein we are so much as to suffer\nthe approaches, solicitations, and temptations of sin: and we beg of\nAlmighty God to keep our consciences quiet, fully and perfectly delivered\nfrom all commerce of evil.\n\nSuch as say that they have reason for their revenging passion, or any\nother sort of troublesome agitation of mind, often say true, as things\nnow are, but not as they were: they speak to us when the causes of their\nerror are by themselves nourished and advanced; but look backward--recall\nthese causes to their beginning--and there you will put them to a\nnonplus.  Will they have their faults less, for being of longer\ncontinuance; and that of an unjust beginning, the sequel can be just?\nWhoever shall desire the good of his country, as I do, without fretting\nor pining himself, will be troubled, but will not swoon to see it\nthreatening either its own ruin, or a no less ruinous continuance; poor\nvessel, that the waves, the winds, and the pilot toss and steer to so\ncontrary designs!\n\n                        \u201cIn tam diversa magister\n                         Ventus et unda trahunt.\u201d\n\nHe who does not gape after the favour of princes, as after a thing he\ncannot live without, does not much concern himself at the coldness of\ntheir reception and countenance, nor at the inconstancy of their wills.\nHe who does not brood over his children or his honours with a slavish\npropension, ceases not to live commodiously enough after their loss.  He\nwho does good principally for his own satisfaction will not be much\ntroubled to see men judge of his actions contrary to his merit.  A\nquarter of an ounce of patience will provide sufficiently against such\ninconveniences.  I find ease in this receipt, redeeming myself in the\nbeginning as good cheap as I can; and find that by this means I have\nescaped much trouble and many difficulties.  With very little ado I stop\nthe first sally of my emotions, and leave the subject that begins to be\ntroublesome before it transports me.  He who stops not the start will\nnever be able to stop the course; he who cannot keep them out will never,\nget them out when they are once got in; and he who cannot arrive at the\nbeginning will never arrive at the end of all.  Nor will he bear the fall\nwho cannot sustain the shock:\n\n     \u201cEtenim ipsae se impellunt, ubi semel a ratione discessum est;\n     ipsaque sibi imbecillitas indulget, in altumque provehitur\n     imprudens, nec reperit locum consistendi.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cFor they throw themselves headlong when once they lose their\n     reason; and infirmity so far indulges itself, and from want of\n     prudence is carried out into deep water, nor finds a place to\n     shelter it.\u201d--Cicero, Tusc. Quaes., iv. 18.]\n\nI am betimes sensible of the little breezes that begin to sing and\nwhistle within, forerunners of the storm:\n\n                              \u201cCeu flamina prima\n               Cum deprensa fremunt sylvis et caeca volutant\n               Murmura, venturos nautis prodentia ventos.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cAs the breezes, pent in the woods, first send out dull murmurs,\n     announcing the approach of winds to mariners.\u201d--AEneid, x. 97.]\n\nHow often have I done myself a manifest injustice to avoid the hazard of\nhaving yet a worse done me by the judges, after an age of vexations,\ndirty and vile practices, more enemies to my nature than fire or the\nrack?\n\n     \u201cConvenit a litibus, quantum licet, et nescio an paulo plus etiam\n     quam licet, abhorrentem esse: est enim non modo liberale, paululum\n     nonnunquam de suo jure decedere, sed interdum etiam fructuosum.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cA man should abhor lawsuits as much as he may, and I know not\n     whether not something more; for \u2018tis not only liberal, but sometimes\n     also advantageous, too, a little to recede from one\u2019s right.\n     --\u201cCicero, De Offic., ii. 18.]\n\nWere we wise, we ought to rejoice and boast, as I one day heard a young\ngentleman of a good family very innocently do, that his mother had lost\nher cause, as if it had been a cough, a fever, or something very\ntroublesome to keep.  Even the favours that fortune might have given me\nthrough relationship or acquaintance with those who have sovereign\nauthority in those affairs, I have very conscientiously and very\ncarefully avoided employing them to the prejudice of others, and of\nadvancing my pretensions above their true right.  In fine, I have so much\nprevailed by my endeavours (and happily I may say it) that I am to this\nday a virgin from all suits in law; though I have had very fair offers\nmade me, and with very just title, would I have hearkened to them, and a\nvirgin from quarrels too.  I have almost passed over a long life without\nany offence of moment, either active or passive, or without ever hearing\na worse word than my own name: a rare favour of Heaven.\n\nOur greatest agitations have ridiculous springs and causes: what ruin did\nour last Duke of Burgundy run into about a cartload of sheepskins!\nAnd was not the graving of a seal the first and principal cause of the\ngreatest commotion that this machine of the world ever underwent?\n--[The civil war between Marius and Sylla; see Plutarch\u2019s Life of Marius,\nc. 3.]--for Pompey and Caesar were but the offsets and continuation of\nthe two others: and I have in my time seen the wisest heads in this\nkingdom assembled with great ceremony, and at the public expense, about\ntreaties and agreements, of which the true decision, in the meantime,\nabsolutely depended upon the ladies\u2019 cabinet council, and the inclination\nof some bit of a woman.\n\nThe poets very well understood this when they put all Greece and Asia to\nfire and sword about an apple.  Look why that man hazards his life and\nhonour upon the fortune of his rapier and dagger; let him acquaint you\nwith the occasion of the quarrel; he cannot do it without blushing: the\noccasion is so idle and frivolous.\n\nA little thing will engage you in it; but being once embarked, all the\ncords draw; great provisions are then required, more hard and more\nimportant.  How much easier is it not to enter in than it is to get out?\nNow we should proceed contrary to the reed, which, at its first\nspringing, produces a long and straight shoot, but afterwards, as if\ntired and out of breath, it runs into thick and frequent joints and\nknots, as so many pauses which demonstrate that it has no more its first\nvigour and firmness; \u2018twere better to begin gently and coldly, and to\nkeep one\u2019s breath and vigorous efforts for the height and stress of the\nbusiness.  We guide affairs in their beginnings, and have them in our own\npower; but afterwards, when they are once at work, \u2018tis they that guide\nand govern us, and we are to follow them.\n\nYet do I not mean to say that this counsel has discharged me of all\ndifficulty, and that I have not often had enough to do to curb and\nrestrain my passions; they are not always to be governed according to the\nmeasure of occasions, and often have their entries very sharp and\nviolent.  But still good fruit and profit may thence be reaped; except\nfor those who in well-doing are not satisfied with any benefit, if\nreputation be wanting; for, in truth, such an effect is not valued but by\nevery one to himself; you are better contented, but not more esteemed,\nseeing you reformed yourself before you got into the whirl of the dance,\nor that the provocative matter was in sight.  Yet not in this only, but\nin all other duties of life also, the way of those who aim at honour is\nvery different from that they proceed by, who propose to themselves order\nand reason.  I find some who rashly and furiously rush into the lists and\ncool in the course.  As Plutarch says, that those who, through false\nshame, are soft and facile to grant whatever is desired of them, are\nafterwards as facile to break their word and to recant; so he who enters\nlightly into a quarrel is apt to go as lightly out of it.  The same\ndifficulty that keeps me from entering into it, would, when once hot and\nengaged in quarrel, incite me to maintain it with great obstinacy and\nresolution.  \u2018Tis the tyranny of custom; when a man is once engaged; he\nmust go through with it, or die.  \u201cUndertake coolly,\u201d said Bias,\n\u201cbut pursue with ardour.\u201d  For want of prudence, men fall into want of\ncourage, which is still more intolerable.\n\nMost accommodations of the quarrels of these days of ours are shameful\nand false; we only seek to save appearances, and in the meantime betray\nand disavow our true intentions; we salve over the fact.  We know very\nwell how we said the thing, and in what sense we spoke it, and the\ncompany know it, and our friends whom we have wished to make sensible of\nour advantage, understand it well enough too: \u2018tis at the expense of our\nfrankness and of the honour of our courage, that we disown our thoughts,\nand seek refuge in falsities, to make matters up.  We give ourselves the\nlie, to excuse the lie we have given to another.  You are not to consider\nif your word or action may admit of another interpretation; \u2018tis your own\ntrue and sincere interpretation, your real meaning in what you said or\ndid, that you are thenceforward to maintain, whatever it cost you.  Men\nspeak to your virtue and conscience, which are not things to be put under\na mask; let us leave these pitiful ways and expedients to the jugglers of\nthe law.  The excuses and reparations that I see every day made and given\nto repair indiscretion, seem to me more scandalous than the indiscretion\nitself.  It were better to affront your adversary a second time than to\noffend yourself by giving him so unmanly a satisfaction.  You have braved\nhim in your heat and anger, and you would flatter and appease him in your\ncooler and better sense; and by that means lay yourself lower and at his\nfeet, whom before you pretended to overtop.  I do not find anything a\ngentleman can say so vicious in him as unsaying what he has said is\ninfamous, when to unsay it is authoritatively extracted from him;\nforasmuch as obstinacy is more excusable in a man of honour than\npusillanimity.  Passions are as easy for me to evade, as they are hard\nfor me to moderate:\n\n          \u201cExscinduntur facilius ammo, quam temperantur.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThey are more easily to be eradicated than governed.\u201d]\n\nHe who cannot attain the noble Stoical impassibility, let him secure\nhimself in the bosom of this popular stolidity of mine; what they\nperformed by virtue, I inure myself to do by temperament.  The middle\nregion harbours storms and tempests; the two extremes, of philosophers\nand peasants, concur in tranquillity and happiness:\n\n               \u201cFelix, qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas,\n               Atque metus omnes et inexorabile fatum\n               Subjecit pedibus, strepitumque Acherontis avari!\n               Fortunatus et ille, Deos qui novit agrestes,\n               Panaque, Sylvanumque senem, Nymphasque sorores!\u201d\n\n     [\u201cHappy is he who could discover the causes of things, and place\n     under his feet all fears and inexorable fate, and the sound of\n     rapacious Acheron: he is blest who knows the country gods, and Pan,\n     and old Sylvanus, and the sister nymphs.\u201d--Virgil, Georg., ii. 490.]\n\nThe births of all things are weak and tender; and therefore we should\nhave our eyes intent on beginnings; for as when, in its infancy, the\ndanger is not perceived, so when it is grown up, the remedy is as little\nto be found.  I had every day encountered a million of crosses, harder to\ndigest in the progress of ambition, than it has been hard for me to curb\nthe natural propension that inclined me to it:\n\n                    \u201cJure perhorrui\n                    Lath conspicuum tollere verticem.\u201d\n\n          [\u201cI ever justly feared to raise my head too high.\u201d\n           --Horace, Od.,iii. 16, 18.]\n\nAll public actions are subject to uncertain and various interpretations;\nfor too many heads judge of them.  Some say of this civic employment of\nmine (and I am willing to say a word or two about it, not that it is\nworth so much, but to give an account of my manners in such things), that\nI have behaved myself in it as a man who is too supine and of a languid\ntemperament; and they have some colour for what they say.  I endeavoured\nto keep my mind and my thoughts in repose;\n\n          \u201cCum semper natura, tum etiam aetate jam quietus;\u201d\n\n          [\u201cAs being always quiet by nature, so also now by age.\u201d\n           --Cicero, De Petit. Consul., c. 2.]\n\nand if they sometimes lash out upon some rude and sensible impression,\n\u2018tis in truth without my advice.  Yet from this natural heaviness of\nmine, men ought not to conclude a total inability in me (for want of care\nand want of sense are two very different things), and much less any\nunkindness or ingratitude towards that corporation who employed the\nutmost means they had in their power to oblige me, both before they knew\nme and after; and they did much more for me in choosing me anew than in\nconferring that honour upon me at first.  I wish them all imaginable\ngood; and assuredly had occasion been, there is nothing I would have\nspared for their service; I did for them as I would have done for myself.\n\u2018Tis a good, warlike, and generous people, but capable of obedience and\ndiscipline, and of whom the best use may be made, if well guided.  They\nsay also that my administration passed over without leaving any mark or\ntrace.  Good!  They moreover accuse my cessation in a time when everybody\nalmost was convicted of doing too much.  I am impatient to be doing where\nmy will spurs me on; but this itself is an enemy to perseverance.  Let\nhim who will make use of me according to my own way, employ me in affairs\nwhere vigour and liberty are required, where a direct, short, and,\nmoreover, a hazardous conduct are necessary; I may do something; but if\nit must be long, subtle, laborious, artificial and intricate, he had\nbetter call in somebody else.  All important offices are not necessarily\ndifficult: I came prepared to do somewhat rougher work, had there been\ngreat occasion; for it is in my power to do something more than I do, or\nthan I love to do.  I did not, to my knowledge, omit anything that my\nduty really required.  I easily forgot those offices that ambition mixes\nwith duty and palliates with its title; these are they that, for the most\npart, fill the eyes and ears, and give men the most satisfaction; not the\nthing but the appearance contents them; if they hear no noise, they think\nmen sleep.  My humour is no friend to tumult; I could appease a commotion\nwithout commotion, and chastise a disorder without being myself\ndisorderly; if I stand in need of anger and inflammation, I borrow it,\nand put it on.  My manners are languid, rather faint than sharp.  I do\nnot condemn a magistrate who sleeps, provided the people under his charge\nsleep as well as he: the laws in that case sleep too.  For my part, I\ncommend a gliding, staid, and silent life:\n\n          \u201cNeque submissam et abjectam, neque se efferentem;\u201d\n\n          [\u201cNeither subject and abject, nor obtrusive.\u201d\n           --Cicero, De Offic., i. 34]\n\nmy fortune will have it so.  I am descended from a family that has lived\nwithout lustre or tumult, and, time out of mind, particularly ambitious\nof a character for probity.\n\nOur people nowadays are so bred up to bustle and ostentation, that good\nnature, moderation, equability, constancy, and such like quiet and\nobscure qualities, are no more thought on or regarded.  Rough bodies make\nthemselves felt; the smooth are imperceptibly handled: sickness is felt,\nhealth little or not at all; no more than the oils that foment us, in\ncomparison of the pains for which we are fomented.  \u2018Tis acting for one\u2019s\nparticular reputation and profit, not for the public good, to refer that\nto be done in the public squares which one may do in the council chamber;\nand to noon day what might have been done the night before; and to be\njealous to do that himself which his colleague can do as well as he; so\nwere some surgeons of Greece wont to perform their operations upon\nscaffolds in the sight of the people, to draw more practice and profit.\nThey think that good rules cannot be understood but by the sound of\ntrumpet.  Ambition is not a vice of little people, nor of such modest\nmeans as ours.  One said to Alexander: \u201cYour father will leave you a\ngreat dominion, easy and pacific\u201d; this youth was emulous of his father\u2019s\nvictories and of the justice of his government; he would not have enjoyed\nthe empire of the world in ease and peace.  Alcibiades, in Plato, had\nrather die young, beautiful, rich, noble, and learned, and all this in\nfull excellence, than to stop short of such condition; this disease is,\nperadventure, excusable in so strong and so full a soul.  When wretched\nand dwarfish little souls cajole and deceive themselves, and think to\nspread their fame for having given right judgment in an affair, or\nmaintained the discipline of the guard of a gate of their city, the more\nthey think to exalt their heads the more they show their tails.  This\nlittle well-doing has neither body nor life; it vanishes in the first\nmouth, and goes no further than from one street to another.  Talk of it\nby all means to your son or your servant, like that old fellow who,\nhaving no other auditor of his praises nor approver of his valour,\nboasted to his chambermaid, crying, \u201cO Perrete, what a brave, clever man\nhast thou for thy master!\u201d  At the worst, talk of it to yourself, like a\ncouncillor of my acquaintance, who, having disgorged a whole cartful of\nlaw jargon with great heat and as great folly, coming out of the council\nchamber to make water, was heard very complacently to mutter betwixt his\nteeth:\n\n          \u201cNon nobis, domine, non nobis, sed nomini tuo da gloriam.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cNot unto us, O Lord, not to us: but unto Thy name be the glory.\u201d\n      --Psalm cxiii. I.]\n\nHe who gets it of nobody else, let him pay himself out of his own purse.\n\nFame is not prostituted at so cheap a rate: rare and exemplary actions,\nto which it is due, would not endure the company of this prodigious crowd\nof petty daily performances.  Marble may exalt your titles, as much as\nyou please, for having repaired a rod of wall or cleansed a public sewer;\nbut not men of sense.  Renown does not follow all good deeds, if novelty\nand difficulty be not conjoined; nay, so much as mere esteem, according\nto the Stoics, is not due to every action that proceeds from virtue; nor\nwill they allow him bare thanks who, out of temperance, abstains from an\nold blear-eyed crone.  Those who have known the admirable qualities of\nScipio Africanus, deny him the glory that Panaetius attributes to him, of\nbeing abstinent from gifts, as a glory not so much his as that of his\nage.  We have pleasures suitable to our lot; let us not usurp those of\ngrandeur: our own are more natural, and by so much more solid and sure,\nas they are lower.  If not for that of conscience, yet at least for\nambition\u2019s sake, let us reject ambition; let us disdain that thirst of\nhonour and renown, so low and mendicant, that it makes us beg it of all\nsorts of people:\n\n          \u201cQuae est ista laus quae: possit e macello peti?\u201d\n\n     [\u201cWhat praise is that which is to be got in the market-place (meat\n     market)?\u201d  Cicero, De Fin., ii. 15.]\n\nby abject means, and at what cheap rate soever: \u2018tis dishonour to be so\nhonoured.  Let us learn to be no more greedy, than we are capable, of\nglory.  To be puffed up with every action that is innocent or of use, is\nonly for those with whom such things are extraordinary and rare: they\nwill value it as it costs them.  The more a good effect makes a noise,\nthe more do I abate of its goodness as I suspect that it was more\nperformed for the noise, than upon account of the goodness: exposed upon\nthe stall, \u2018tis half sold.  Those actions have much more grace and\nlustre, that slip from the hand of him that does them, negligently and\nwithout noise, and that some honest man thereafter finds out and raises\nfrom the shade, to produce it to the light upon its own account,\n\n          \u201cMihi quidem laudabiliora videntur omnia, quae sine\n          venditatione, et sine populo teste fiunt,\u201d\n\n     [\u201cAll things truly seem more laudable to me that are performed\n     without ostentation, and without the testimony of the people.\u201d\n      --Cicero, Tusc.  Quaes., ii. 26.]\n\nsays the most ostentatious man that ever lived.\n\nI had but to conserve and to continue, which are silent and insensible\neffects: innovation is of great lustre; but \u2018tis interdicted in this age,\nwhen we are pressed upon and have nothing to defend ourselves from but\nnovelties.  To forbear doing is often as generous as to do; but \u2018tis less\nin the light, and the little good I have in me is of this kind.  In fine,\noccasions in this employment of mine have been confederate with my\nhumour, and I heartily thank them for it.  Is there any who desires to be\nsick, that he may see his physician at work? and would not the physician\ndeserve to be whipped who should wish the plague amongst us, that he\nmight put his art in practice?  I have never been of that wicked humour,\nand common enough, to desire that troubles and disorders in this city\nshould elevate and honour my government; I have ever heartily contributed\nall I could to their tranquillity and ease.\n\nHe who will not thank me for the order, the sweet and silent calm that\nhas accompanied my administration, cannot, however, deprive me of the\nshare that belongs to me by title of my good fortune.  And I am of such a\ncomposition, that I would as willingly be lucky as wise, and had rather\nowe my successes purely to the favour of Almighty God, than to any\noperation of my own.  I had sufficiently published to the world my\nunfitness for such public offices; but I have something in me yet worse\nthan incapacity itself; which is, that I am not much displeased at it,\nand that I do not much go about to cure it, considering the course of\nlife that I have proposed to myself.\n\nNeither have I satisfied myself in this employment; but I have very near\narrived at what I expected from my own performance, and have much\nsurpassed what I promised them with whom I had to do: for I am apt to\npromise something less than what I am able to do, and than what I hope to\nmake good.  I assure myself that I have left no offence or hatred behind\nme; to leave regret or desire for me amongst them, I at least know very\nwell that I never much aimed at it:\n\n              \u201cMene huic confidere monstro!\n               Mene salis placidi vultum, fluctusque quietos\n               Ignorare?\u201d\n\n     [\u201cShould I place confidence in this monster?  Should I be ignorant\n     of the dangers of that seeming placid sea, those now quiet waves?\u201d\n      --Virgil, Aeneid, V. 849.]\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nOF CRIPPLES\n\n\u2018Tis now two or three years ago that they made the year ten days shorter\nin France.--[By the adoption of the Gregorian calendar.]--How many\nchanges may we expect should follow this reformation! it was really\nmoving heaven and earth at once.  Yet nothing for all that stirs from its\nplace my neighbours still find their seasons of sowing and reaping, the\nopportunities of doing their business, the hurtful and propitious days,\ndust at the same time where they had, time out of mind, assigned them;\nthere was no more error perceived in our old use, than there is amendment\nfound in the alteration; so great an uncertainty there is throughout; so\ngross, obscure, and obtuse is our perception.  \u2018Tis said that this\nregulation might have been carried on with less inconvenience, by\nsubtracting for some years, according to the example of Augustus, the\nBissextile, which is in some sort a day of impediment and trouble, till\nwe had exactly satisfied this debt, the which itself is not done by this\ncorrection, and we yet remain some days in arrear: and yet, by this\nmeans, such order might be taken for the future, arranging that after the\nrevolution of such or such a number of years, the supernumerary day might\nbe always thrown out, so that we could not, henceforward, err above\nfour-and-twenty hours in our computation.  We have no other account of\ntime but years; the world has for many ages made use of that only; and\nyet it is a measure that to this day we are not agreed upon, and one that\nwe still doubt what form other nations have variously given to it, and\nwhat was the true use of it.  What does this saying of some mean, that\nthe heavens in growing old bow themselves down nearer towards us, and put\nus into an uncertainty even of hours and days? and that which Plutarch\nsays of the months, that astrology had not in his time determined as to\nthe motion of the moon; what a fine condition are we in to keep records\nof things past.\n\nI was just now ruminating, as I often do, what a free and roving thing\nhuman reason is.  I ordinarily see that men, in things propounded to\nthem, more willingly study to find out reasons than to ascertain truth:\nthey slip over presuppositions, but are curious in examination of\nconsequences; they leave the things, and fly to the causes.  Pleasant\ntalkers!  The knowledge of causes only concerns him who has the conduct\nof things; not us, who are merely to undergo them, and who have perfectly\nfull and accomplished use of them, according to our need, without\npenetrating into the original and essence; wine is none the more pleasant\nto him who knows its first faculties.  On the contrary, both the body and\nthe soul interrupt and weaken the right they have of the use of the world\nand of themselves, by mixing with it the opinion of learning; effects\nconcern us, but the means not at all.  To determine and to distribute\nappertain to superiority and command; as it does to subjection to accept.\nLet me reprehend our custom.  They commonly begin thus: \u201cHow is such a\nthing done?\u201d  Whereas they should say, \u201cIs such a thing done?\u201d  Our\nreason is able to create a hundred other worlds, and to find out the\nbeginnings and contexture; it needs neither matter nor foundation: let it\nbut run on, it builds as well in the air as on the earth, and with\ninanity as well as with matter:\n\n                    \u201cDare pondus idonea fumo.\u201d\n\n          [\u201cAble to give weight to smoke.\u201d--Persius, v. 20.]\n\nI find that almost throughout we should say, \u201cthere is no such thing,\u201d\n and should myself often make use of this answer, but I dare not: for they\ncry that it is an evasion produced from ignorance and weakness of\nunderstanding; and I am fain, for the most part, to juggle for company,\nand prate of frivolous subjects and tales that I believe not a word of;\nbesides that, in truth, \u2018tis a little rude and quarrelsome flatly to deny\na stated fact; and few people but will affirm, especially in things hard\nto be believed, that they have seen them, or at least will name witnesses\nwhose authority will stop our mouths from contradiction.  In this way, we\nknow the foundations and means of things that never were; and the world\nscuffles about a thousand questions, of which both the Pro and the Con\nare false.\n\n          \u201cIta finitima sunt falsa veris, ut in praecipitem\n          locum non debeat se sapiens committere.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cFalse things are so near the true, that a wise man should not\n     trust himself in a precipitous place\u201d--Cicero, Acad., ii.  21.]\n\nTruth and lies are faced alike; their port, taste, and proceedings are\nthe same, and we look upon them with the same eye.  I find that we are\nnot only remiss in defending ourselves from deceit, but that we seek and\noffer ourselves to be gulled; we love to entangle ourselves in vanity, as\na thing conformable to our being.\n\nI have seen the birth of many miracles in my time; which, although they\nwere abortive, yet have we not failed to foresee what they would have\ncome to, had they lived their full age.  \u2018Tis but finding the end of the\nclew, and a man may wind off as much as he will; and there is a greater\ndistance betwixt nothing and the least thing in the world than there is\nbetwixt this and the greatest.  Now the first that are imbued with this\nbeginning of novelty, when they set out with their tale, find, by the\noppositions they meet with, where the difficulty of persuasion lies, and\nso caulk up that place with some false piece;\n\n     [Voltaire says of this passage, \u201cHe who would learn to doubt should\n     read this whole chapter of Montaigne, the least methodical of all\n     philosophers, but the wisest and most amiable.\u201d\n      --Melanges Historiques, xvii.  694, ed. of Lefevre.]\n\nbesides that:\n\n     \u201cInsita hominibus libido alendi de industria rumores,\u201d\n\n          [\u201cMen having a natural desire to nourish reports.\u201d\n           --Livy, xxviii. 24.]\n\nwe naturally make a conscience of restoring what has been lent us,\nwithout some usury and accession of our own.  The particular error first\nmakes the public error, and afterwards, in turn, the public error makes\nthe particular one; and thus all this vast fabric goes forming and piling\nitself up from hand to hand, so that the remotest witness knows more\nabout it than those who were nearest, and the last informed is better\npersuaded than the first.\n\n\u2018Tis a natural progress; for whoever believes anything, thinks it a work\nof charity to persuade another into the same opinion; which the better to\ndo, he will make no difficulty of adding as much of his own invention as\nhe conceives necessary to his tale to encounter the resistance or want of\nconception he meets with in others.  I myself, who make a great\nconscience of lying, and am not very solicitous of giving credit and\nauthority to what I say, yet find that in the arguments I have in hand,\nbeing heated with the opposition of another, or by the proper warmth of\nmy own narration, I swell and puff up my subject by voice, motion,\nvigour, and force of words, and moreover, by extension and amplification,\nnot without some prejudice to the naked truth; but I do it conditionally\nwithal, that to the first who brings me to myself, and who asks me the\nplain and bare truth, I presently surrender my passion, and deliver the\nmatter to him without exaggeration, without emphasis, or any painting of\nmy own.  A quick and earnest way of speaking, as mine is, is apt to run\ninto hyperbole.  There is nothing to which men commonly are more inclined\nthan to make way for their own opinions; where the ordinary means fail\nus, we add command, force, fire, and sword.  \u2018Tis a misfortune to be at\nsuch a pass, that the best test of truth is the multitude of believers in\na crowd, where the number of fools so much exceeds the wise:\n\n     \u201cQuasi vero quidquam sit tam valde, quam nil sapere, vulgare.\u201d\n\n          [\u201cAs if anything were so common as ignorance.\u201d\n           --Cicero, De Divin., ii.]\n\n          \u201cSanitatis patrocinium est, insanientium turba.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThe multitude of fools is a protection to the wise.\u201d\n      --St. Augustine, De Civit. Dei, vi. 10.]\n\n\u2018Tis hard to resolve a man\u2019s judgment against the common opinions: the\nfirst persuasion, taken from the very subject itself, possesses the\nsimple, and from them diffuses itself to the wise, under the authority of\nthe number and antiquity of the witnesses.  For my part, what I should\nnot believe from one, I should not believe from a hundred and one: and I\ndo not judge opinions by years.\n\n\u2018Tis not long since one of our princes, in whom the gout had spoiled an\nexcellent nature and sprightly disposition, suffered himself to be so far\npersuaded with the report made to him of the marvellous operations of a\ncertain priest who by words and gestures cured all sorts of diseases,\nas to go a long journey to seek him out, and by the force of his mere\nimagination, for some hours so persuaded and laid his legs asleep, as to\nobtain that service from them they had long time forgotten.  Had fortune\nheaped up five or six such-like incidents, it had been enough to have\nbrought this miracle into nature.  There was afterwards discovered so\nmuch simplicity and so little art in the author of these performances,\nthat he was thought too contemptible to be punished, as would be thought\nof most such things, were they well examined:\n\n               \u201cMiramur ex intervallo fallentia.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cWe admire after an interval (or at a distance) things that\n     deceive.\u201d--Seneca, Ep., 118, 2.]\n\nSo does our sight often represent to us strange images at a distance that\nvanish on approaching near:\n\n               \u201cNunquam ad liquidum fama perducitur.\u201d\n\n               [\u201cReport is never fully substantiated.\u201d\n                --Quintus Curtius, ix. 2.]\n\n\u2018Tis wonderful from how many idle beginnings and frivolous causes such\nfamous impressions commonly, proceed.  This it is that obstructs\ninformation; for whilst we seek out causes and solid and weighty ends,\nworthy of so great a name, we lose the true ones; they escape our sight\nby their littleness.  And, in truth, a very prudent, diligent, and subtle\ninquisition is required in such searches, indifferent, and not\nprepossessed.  To this very hour, all these miracles and strange events\nhave concealed themselves from me: I have never seen greater monster or\nmiracle in the world than myself: one grows familiar with all strange\nthings by time and custom, but the more I frequent and the better I know\nmyself, the more does my own deformity astonish me, the less I understand\nmyself.\n\nThe principal right of advancing and producing such accidents is reserved\nto fortune.  Passing the day before yesterday through a village two\nleagues from my house, I found the place yet warm with a miracle that had\nlately failed of success there, where with first the neighbourhood had\nbeen several months amused; then the neighbouring provinces began to take\nit up, and to run thither in great companies of all sorts of people.\nA young fellow of the place had one night in sport counterfeited the\nvoice of a spirit in his own house, without any other design at present,\nbut only for sport; but this having succeeded with him better than he\nexpected, to extend his farce with more actors he associated with him a\nstupid silly country girl, and at last there were three of them of the\nsame age and understanding, who from domestic, proceeded to public,\npreachings, hiding themselves under the altar of the church, never\nspeaking but by night, and forbidding any light to be brought.  From\nwords which tended to the conversion of the world, and threats of the day\nof judgment (for these are subjects under the authority and reverence of\nwhich imposture most securely lurks), they proceeded to visions and\ngesticulations so simple and ridiculous that--nothing could hardly be so\ngross in the sports of little children.  Yet had fortune never so little\nfavoured the design, who knows to what height this juggling might have at\nlast arrived?  These poor devils are at present in prison, and are like\nshortly to pay for the common folly; and I know not whether some judge\nwill not also make them smart for his.  We see clearly into this, which\nis discovered; but in many things of the like nature that exceed our\nknowledge, I am of opinion that we ought to suspend our judgment, whether\nas to rejection or as to reception.\n\nGreat abuses in the world are begotten, or, to speak more boldly, all the\nabuses of the world are begotten, by our being taught to be afraid of\nprofessing our ignorance, and that we are bound to accept all things we\nare not able to refute: we speak of all things by precepts and decisions.\nThe style at Rome was that even that which a witness deposed to having\nseen with his own eyes, and what a judge determined with his most certain\nknowledge, was couched in this form of speaking: \u201cit seems to me.\u201d  They\nmake me hate things that are likely, when they would impose them upon me\nas infallible.  I love these words which mollify and moderate the\ntemerity of our propositions: \u201cperadventure; in some sort; some; \u2018tis\nsaid, I think,\u201d and the like: and had I been set to train up children I\nhad put this way of answering into their mouths, inquiring and not\nresolving: \u201cWhat does this mean?  I understand it not; it may be: is it\ntrue?\u201d so that they should rather have retained the form of pupils at\nthreescore years old than to go out doctors, as they do, at ten.  Whoever\nwill be cured of ignorance must confess it.\n\nIris is the daughter of Thaumas;\n\n     [\u201cThat is, of Admiration.  She (Iris, the rainbow) is beautiful, and\n     for that reason, because she has a face to be admired, she is said\n     to have been the daughter of Thamus.\u201d\n      --Cicero, De Nat. Deor., iii. 20.]\n\nadmiration is the foundation of all philosophy, inquisition the progress,\nignorance the end.  But there is a sort of ignorance, strong and\ngenerous, that yields nothing in honour and courage to knowledge; an\nignorance which to conceive requires no less knowledge than to conceive\nknowledge itself.  I read in my younger years a trial that Corras,\n\n     [A celebrated Calvinist lawyer, born at Toulouse; 1513, and\n     assassinated there, 4th October 1572.]\n\na councillor of Toulouse, printed, of a strange incident, of two men who\npresented themselves the one for the other.  I remember (and I hardly\nremember anything else) that he seemed to have rendered the imposture of\nhim whom he judged to be guilty, so wonderful and so far exceeding both\nour knowledge and his own, who was the judge, that I thought it a very\nbold sentence that condemned him to be hanged.  Let us have some form of\ndecree that says, \u201cThe court understands nothing of the matter\u201d more\nfreely and ingenuously than the Areopagites did, who, finding themselves\nperplexed with a cause they could not unravel, ordered the parties to\nappear again after a hundred years.\n\nThe witches of my neighbourhood run the hazard of their lives upon the\nreport of every new author who seeks to give body to their dreams.  To\naccommodate the examples that Holy Writ gives us of such things, most\ncertain and irrefragable examples, and to tie them to our modern events,\nseeing that we neither see the causes nor the means, will require another\nsort-of wit than ours.  It, peradventure, only appertains to that sole\nall-potent testimony to tell us.  \u201cThis is, and that is, and not that\nother.\u201d  God ought to be believed; and certainly with very good reason;\nbut not one amongst us for all that who is astonished at his own\nnarration (and he must of necessity be astonished if he be not out of his\nwits), whether he employ it about other men\u2019s affairs or against himself.\n\nI am plain and heavy, and stick to the solid and the probable, avoiding\nthose ancient reproaches:\n\n          \u201cMajorem fidem homines adhibent iis, quae non intelligunt;\n          --Cupidine humani ingenii libentius obscura creduntur.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cMen are most apt to believe what they least understand: and from\n     the acquisitiveness of the human intellect, obscure things are more\n     easily credited.\u201d The second sentence is from Tacitus, Hist. 1. 22.]\n\nI see very well that men get angry, and that I am forbidden to doubt upon\npain of execrable injuries; a new way of persuading!  Thank God, I am not\nto be cuffed into belief.  Let them be angry with those who accuse their\nopinion of falsity; I only accuse it of difficulty and boldness, and\ncondemn the opposite affirmation equally, if not so imperiously, with\nthem.  He who will establish this proposition by authority and huffing\ndiscovers his reason to be very weak.  For a verbal and scholastic\naltercation let them have as much appearance as their contradictors;\n\n               \u201cVideantur sane, non affirmentur modo;\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThey may indeed appear to be; let them not be affirmed (Let them\n     state the probabilities, but not affirm.)\u201d\n      --Cicero, Acad., n. 27.]\n\nbut in the real consequence they draw from it these have much the\nadvantage.  To kill men, a clear and strong light is required, and our\nlife is too real and essential to warrant these supernatural and\nfantastic accidents.\n\nAs to drugs and poisons, I throw them out of my count, as being the worst\nsort of homicides: yet even in this, \u2018tis said, that men are not always\nto rely upon the personal confessions of these people; for they have\nsometimes been known to accuse themselves of the murder of persons who\nhave afterwards been found living and well.  In these other extravagant\naccusations, I should be apt to say, that it is sufficient a man, what\nrecommendation soever he may have, be believed as to human things; but of\nwhat is beyond his conception, and of supernatural effect, he ought then\nonly to be believed when authorised by a supernatural approbation.  The\nprivilege it has pleased Almighty God to give to some of our witnesses,\nought not to be lightly communicated and made cheap.  I have my ears\nbattered with a thousand such tales as these: \u201cThree persons saw him such\na day in the east three, the next day in the west: at such an hour, in\nsuch a place, and in such habit\u201d; assuredly I should not believe it\nmyself.  How much more natural and likely do I find it that two men\nshould lie than that one man in twelve hours\u2019 time should fly with the\nwind from east to west?  How much more natural that our understanding\nshould be carried from its place by the volubility of our disordered\nminds, than that one of us should be carried by a strange spirit upon a\nbroomstaff, flesh and bones as we are, up the shaft of a chimney?  Let\nnot us seek illusions from without and unknown, we who are perpetually\nagitated with illusions domestic and our own.  Methinks one is pardonable\nin disbelieving a miracle, at least, at all events where one can elude\nits verification as such, by means not miraculous; and I am of St.\nAugustine\u2019s opinion, that, \u201c\u2018tis better to lean towards doubt than\nassurance, in things hard to prove and dangerous to believe.\u201d\n\n\u2018Tis now some years ago that I travelled through the territories of a\nsovereign prince, who, in my favour, and to abate my incredulity, did me\nthe honour to let me see, in his own presence, and in a private place,\nten or twelve prisoners of this kind, and amongst others, an old woman,\na real witch in foulness and deformity, who long had been famous in that\nprofession.  I saw both proofs and free confessions, and I know not what\ninsensible mark upon the miserable creature: I examined and talked with\nher and the rest as much and as long as I would, and gave the best and\nsoundest attention I could, and I am not a man to suffer my judgment to\nbe made captive by prepossession.  In the end, and in all conscience, I\nshould rather have prescribed them hellebore than hemlock;\n\n     \u201cCaptisque res magis mentibus, quam consceleratis similis visa;\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThe thing was rather to be attributed to madness, than malice.\u201d\n      (\u201cThe thing seemed to resemble minds possessed rather than guilty.\u201d)\n     --Livy, viii, 18.]\n\njustice has its corrections proper for such maladies.  As to the\noppositions and arguments that worthy men have made to me, both there,\nand often in other places, I have met with none that have convinced me,\nand that have not admitted a more likely solution than their conclusions.\nIt is true, indeed, that the proofs and reasons that are founded upon\nexperience and fact, I do not go about to untie, neither have they any\nend; I often cut them, as Alexander did the Gordian knot.  After all,\n\u2018tis setting a man\u2019s conjectures at a very high price upon them to cause\na man to be roasted alive.\n\nWe are told by several examples, as Praestantius of his father, that\nbeing more profoundly, asleep than men usually are, he fancied himself\nto be a mare, and that he served the soldiers for a sumpter; and what\nhe fancied himself to be, he really proved.  If sorcerers dream so\nmaterially; if dreams can sometimes so incorporate themselves with\neffects, still I cannot believe that therefore our will should be\naccountable to justice; which I say as one who am neither judge nor privy\ncouncillor, and who think myself by many degrees unworthy so to be, but a\nman of the common sort, born and avowed to the obedience of the public\nreason, both in its words and acts.  He who should record my idle talk as\nbeing to the prejudice of the pettiest law, opinion, or custom of his\nparish, would do himself a great deal of wrong, and me much more; for, in\nwhat I say, I warrant no other certainty, but that \u2018tis what I had then\nin my thought, a tumultuous and wavering thought.  All I say is by way of\ndiscourse, and nothing by way of advice:\n\n          \u201cNec me pudet, ut istos fateri nescire, quod nesciam;\u201d\n\n     [\u201cNeither am I ashamed, as they are, to confess my ignorance of what\n     I do not know.\u201d--Cicero, Tusc. Quaes., i. 25.]\n\nI should not speak so boldly, if it were my due to be believed; and so I\ntold a great man, who complained of the tartness and contentiousness of\nmy exhortations.  Perceiving you to be ready and prepared on one part, I\npropose to you the other, with all the diligence and care I can, to clear\nyour judgment, not to compel it.  God has your hearts in His hands, and\nwill furnish you with the means of choice.  I am not so presumptuous even\nas to desire that my opinions should bias you--in a thing of so great\nimportance: my fortune has not trained them up to so potent and elevated\nconclusions.  Truly, I have not only a great many humours, but also a\ngreat many opinions, that I would endeavour to make my son dislike, if I\nhad one.  What, if the truest are not always the most commodious to man,\nbeing of so wild a composition?\n\nWhether it be to the purpose or not, tis no great matter: \u2018tis a common\nproverb in Italy, that he knows not Venus in her perfect sweetness who\nhas never lain with a lame mistress.  Fortune, or some particular\nincident, long ago put this saying into the mouths of the people; and the\nsame is said of men as well as of women; for the queen of the Amazons\nanswered the Scythian who courted her to love, \u201cLame men perform best.\u201d\n In this feminine republic, to evade the dominion of the males, they\nlamed them in their infancy--arms, legs, and other members that gave them\nadvantage over them, and only made use of them in that wherein we, in\nthese parts of the world, make use of them.  I should have been apt to\nthink; that the shuffling pace of the lame mistress added some new\npleasure to the work, and some extraordinary titillation to those who\nwere at the sport; but I have lately learnt that ancient philosophy has\nitself determined it, which says that the legs and thighs of lame women,\nnot receiving, by reason of their imperfection, their due aliment, it\nfalls out that the genital parts above are fuller and better supplied and\nmuch more vigorous; or else that this defect, hindering exercise, they\nwho are troubled with it less dissipate their strength, and come more\nentire to the sports of Venus; which also is the reason why the Greeks\ndecried the women-weavers as being more hot than other women by reason of\ntheir sedentary trade, which they carry on without any great exercise of\nthe body.  What is it we may not reason of at this rate?  I might also\nsay of these, that the jaggling about whilst so sitting at work, rouses\nand provokes their desire, as the swinging and jolting of coaches does\nthat of our ladies.\n\nDo not these examples serve to make good what I said at first: that our\nreasons often anticipate the effect, and have so infinite an extent of\njurisdiction that they judge and exercise themselves even on inanity\nitself and non-existency?  Besides the flexibility of our invention to\nforge reasons of all sorts of dreams, our imagination is equally facile\nto receive impressions of falsity by very frivolous appearances; for, by\nthe sole authority of the ancient and common use of this proverb, I have\nformerly made myself believe that I have had more pleasure in a woman by\nreason she was not straight, and accordingly reckoned that deformity\namongst her graces.\n\nTorquato Tasso, in the comparison he makes betwixt France and Italy,\nsays that he has observed that our legs are generally smaller than those\nof the Italian gentlemen, and attributes the cause of it to our being\ncontinually on horseback; which is the very same cause from which\nSuetonius draws a quite opposite conclusion; for he says, on the\ncontrary, that Germanicus had made his legs bigger by the continuation of\nthe same exercise.\n\nNothing is so supple and erratic as our understanding; it is the shoe of\nTheramenes, fit for all feet.  It is double and diverse, and the matters\nare double and diverse too.  \u201cGive me a drachm of silver,\u201d said a Cynic\nphilosopher to Antigonus.  \u201cThat is not a present befitting a king,\u201d\n replied he.  \u201cGive me then a talent,\u201d said the other.  \u201cThat is not a\npresent befitting a Cynic.\u201d\n\n              \u201cSeu plures calor ille vias et caeca relaxat\n               Spiramenta, novas veniat qua succus in herbas\n               Seu durat magis, et venas astringit hiantes;\n               Ne tenues pluviae, rapidive potentia colic\n               Acrior, aut Boreae penetrabile frigus adurat.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cWhether the heat opens more passages and secret pores through\n     which the sap may be derived into the new-born herbs; or whether it\n     rather hardens and binds the gaping veins that the small showers and\n     keen influence of the violent sun or penetrating cold of Boreas may\n     not hurt them.\u201d--Virg., Georg., i. 89.]\n\n                    \u201cOgni medaglia ha il suo rovescio.\u201d\n\n          [\u201cEvery medal has its reverse.\u201d--Italian Proverb.]\n\nThis is the reason why Clitomachus said of old that Carneades had outdone\nthe labours of Hercules, in having eradicated consent from men, that is\nto say, opinion and the courage of judging.  This so vigorous fancy of\nCarneades sprang, in my opinion, anciently from the impudence of those\nwho made profession of knowledge and their immeasurable self-conceit.\nAEsop was set to sale with two other slaves; the buyer asked the first of\nthese what he could do; he, to enhance his own value, promised mountains\nand marvels, saying he could do this and that, and I know not what; the\nsecond said as much of himself or more: when it came to AEsop\u2019s turn, and\nthat he was also asked what he could do; \u201cNothing,\u201d said he, \u201cfor these\ntwo have taken up all before me; they know everything.\u201d  So has it\nhappened in the school of philosophy: the pride of those who attributed\nthe capacity of all things to the human mind created in others, out of\ndespite and emulation, this opinion, that it is capable of nothing: the\none maintain the same extreme in ignorance that the others do in\nknowledge; to make it undeniably manifest that man is immoderate\nthroughout, and can never stop but of necessity and the want of ability\nto proceed further.\n\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nOF PHYSIOGNOMY\n\nAlmost all the opinions we have are taken on authority and trust; and\n\u2018tis not amiss; we could not choose worse than by ourselves in so weak an\nage.  That image of Socrates\u2019 discourses, which his friends have\ntransmitted to us, we approve upon no other account than a reverence to\npublic sanction: \u2018tis not according to our own knowledge; they are not\nafter our way; if anything of the kind should spring up now, few men\nwould value them.  We discern no graces that are not pointed and puffed\nout and inflated by art; such as glide on in their own purity and\nsimplicity easily escape so gross a sight as ours; they have a delicate\nand concealed beauty, such as requires a clear and purified sight to\ndiscover its secret light.  Is not simplicity, as we take it,\ncousin-german to folly and a quality of reproach?  Socrates makes his\nsoul move a natural and common motion: a peasant said this; a woman said\nthat; he has never anybody in his mouth but carters, joiners, cobblers,\nand masons; his are inductions and similitudes drawn from the most common\nand known actions of men; every one understands him.  We should never\nhave recognised the nobility and splendour of his admirable conceptions\nunder so mean a form; we, who think all things low and flat that are not\nelevated, by learned doctrine, and who discern no riches but in pomp and\nshow.  This world of ours is only formed for ostentation: men are only\npuffed up with wind, and are bandied to and fro like tennis-balls.  He\nproposed to himself no vain and idle fancies; his design was to furnish\nus with precepts and things that more really and fitly serve to the use\nof life;\n\n                       \u201cServare modum, finemque tenere,\n                    Naturamque sequi.\u201d\n\n               [\u201cTo keep a just mean, to observe a just limit,\n               and to follow Nature.\u201d--Lucan, ii. 381.]\n\nHe was also always one and the same, and raised himself, not by starts\nbut by complexion, to the highest pitch of vigour; or, to say better,\nmounted not at all, but rather brought down, reduced, and subjected all\nasperities and difficulties to his original and natural condition; for in\nCato \u2018tis most manifest that \u2018tis a procedure extended far beyond the\ncommon ways of men: in the brave exploits of his life, and in his death,\nwe find him always mounted upon the great horse; whereas the other ever\ncreeps upon the ground, and with a gentle and ordinary pace, treats of\nthe most useful matters, and bears himself, both at his death and in the\nrudest difficulties that could present themselves, in the ordinary way of\nhuman life.\n\nIt has fallen out well that the man most worthy to be known and to be\npresented to the world for example should be he of whom we have the most\ncertain knowledge; he has been pried into by the most clear-sighted men\nthat ever were; the testimonies we have of him are admirable both in\nfidelity and fulness.  \u2018Tis a great thing that he was able so to order\nthe pure imaginations of a child, that, without altering or wresting\nthem, he thereby produced the most beautiful effects of our soul: he\npresents it neither elevated nor rich; he only represents it sound, but\nassuredly with a brisk and full health.  By these common and natural\nsprings, by these ordinary and popular fancies, without being moved or\nput out, he set up not only the most regular, but the most high and\nvigorous beliefs, actions, and manners that ever were.  \u2018Tis he who\nbrought again from heaven, where she lost her time, human wisdom, to\nrestore her to man with whom her most just and greatest business lies.\nSee him plead before his judges; observe by what reasons he rouses his\ncourage to the hazards of war; with what arguments he fortifies his\npatience against calumny, tyranny, death, and the perverseness of his\nwife: you will find nothing in all this borrowed from arts and sciences:\nthe simplest may there discover their own means and strength; \u2018tis not\npossible more to retire or to creep more low.  He has done human nature a\ngreat kindness in showing it how much it can do of itself.\n\nWe are all of us richer than we think we are; but we are taught to borrow\nand to beg, and brought up more to make use of what is another\u2019s than of\nour own.  Man can in nothing fix himself to his actual necessity: of\npleasure, wealth, and power, he grasps at more than he can hold; his\ngreediness is incapable of moderation.  And I find that in curiosity of\nknowing he is the same; he cuts himself out more work than he can do, and\nmore than he needs to do: extending the utility of knowledge to the full\nof its matter:\n\n     \u201cUt omnium rerum, sic litterarum quoque, intemperantia laboramus.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cWe carry intemperance into the study of literature, as well as\n     into everything else.\u201d--Seneca, Ep., 106.]\n\nAnd Tacitus had reason to commend the mother of Agricola for having\nrestrained her son in his too violent appetite for learning.\n\nTis a good, if duly considered, which has in it, as the other goods of\nmen have, a great deal of vanity and weakness, proper and natural to\nitself, and that costs very dear.  Its acquisition is far more hazardous\nthan that of all other meat or drink; for, as to other things, what we\nhave bought we carry home in some vessel, and there have full leisure to\nexamine our purchase, how much we shall eat or drink of it, and when: but\nsciences we can, at the very first, stow into no other vessel than the\nsoul; we swallow them in buying, and return from the market, either\nalready infected or amended: there are some that only burden and\novercharge the stomach, instead of nourishing; and, moreover, some that,\nunder colour of curing, poison us.  I have been pleased, in places where\nI have been, to see men in devotion vow ignorance as well as chastity,\npoverty, and penitence: \u2018tis also a gelding of our unruly appetites, to\nblunt this cupidity that spurs us on to the study of books, and to\ndeprive the soul of this voluptuous complacency that tickles us with the\nopinion of knowledge: and \u2018tis plenarily to accomplish the vow of\npoverty, to add unto it that of the mind.  We need little doctrine to\nlive at our ease; and Socrates teaches us that this is in us, and the way\nhow to find it, and the manner how to use it: All our sufficiency which\nexceeds the natural is well-nigh superfluous and vain: \u2018tis much if it\ndoes not rather burden and cumber us than do us good:\n\n               \u201cPaucis opus est literis ad mentem bonam:\u201d\n\n          [\u201cLittle learning is needed to form a sound mind.\u201d\n           --Seneca, Ep., 106.]\n\n\u2018tis a feverish excess of the mind; a tempestuous and unquiet instrument.\nDo but recollect yourself, and you will find in yourself natural\narguments against death, true, and the fittest to serve you in time of\nnecessity: \u2018tis they that make a peasant, and whole nations, die with as\nmuch firmness as a philosopher.  Should I have died less cheerfully\nbefore I had read Cicero\u2019s Tusculan Quastiones?  I believe not; and when\nI find myself at the best, I perceive that my tongue is enriched indeed,\nbut my courage little or nothing elevated by them; that is just as nature\nframed it at first, and defends itself against the conflict only after a\nnatural and ordinary way.  Books have not so much served me for\ninstruction as exercise.  What if knowledge, trying to arm us with new\ndefences against natural inconveniences, has more imprinted in our\nfancies their weight and greatness, than her reasons and subtleties to\nsecure us from them?  They are subtleties, indeed, with which she often\nalarms us to little purpose.  Do but observe how many slight and\nfrivolous, and, if nearly examined, incorporeal arguments, the closest\nand wisest authors scatter about one good one: they are but verbal quirks\nand fallacies to amuse and gull us: but forasmuch as it may be with some\nprofit, I will sift them no further; many of that sort are here and there\ndispersed up and down this book, either borrowed or by imitation.\nTherefore one ought to take a little heed not to call that force which is\nonly a pretty knack of writing, and that solid which is only sharp, or\nthat good which is only fine:\n\n               \u201cQuae magis gustata quam potata, delectant,\u201d\n\n          [\u201cWhich more delight in the tasting than in being drunk.\u201d\n           --Cicero, Tusc. Quaes., v. 5.]\n\neverything that pleases does not nourish:\n\n               \u201cUbi non ingenii, sed animi negotium agitur.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cWhere the question is not about the wit, but about the soul.\u201d\n      --Seneca, Ep., 75.]\n\nTo see the trouble that Seneca gives himself to fortify himself against\ndeath; to see him so sweat and pant to harden and encourage himself, and\nbustle so long upon this perch, would have lessened his reputation with\nme, had he not very bravely held himself at the last.  His so ardent and\nfrequent agitations discover that he was in himself impetuous and\npassionate,\n\n          \u201cMagnus animus remissius loquitur, et securius .  .  .\n          non est alius ingenio, alius ammo color;\u201d\n\n     [\u201cA great courage speaks more calmly and more securely.  There is\n     not one complexion for the wit and another for the mind.\u201d\n      --Seneca, Ep. 114, 115]\n\nhe must be convinced at his own expense; and he in some sort discovers\nthat he was hard pressed by his enemy.  Plutarch\u2019s way, by how much it is\nmore disdainful and farther stretched, is, in my opinion, so much more\nmanly and persuasive: and I am apt to believe that his soul had more\nassured and more regular motions.  The one more sharp, pricks and makes\nus start, and more touches the soul; the other more constantly solid,\nforms, establishes, and supports us, and more touches the understanding.\nThat ravishes the judgment, this wins it.  I have likewise seen other\nwritings, yet more reverenced than these, that in the representation of\nthe conflict they maintain against the temptations of the flesh, paint\nthem, so sharp, so powerful and invincible, that we ourselves, who are of\nthe common herd, are as much to wonder at the strangeness and unknown\nforce of their temptation, as at the resisting it.\n\nTo what end do we so arm ourselves with this harness of science?  Let us\nlook down upon the poor people that we see scattered upon the face of the\nearth, prone and intent upon their business, that neither know Aristotle\nnor Cato, example nor precept; from these nature every day extracts\neffects of constancy and patience, more pure and manly than those we so\ninquisitively study in the schools: how many do I ordinarily see who\nslight poverty?  how many who desire to die, or who die without alarm or\nregret?  He who is now digging in my garden, has this morning buried his\nfather or his son.  The very names by which they call diseases sweeten\nand mollify the sharpness of them: the phthisic is with them no more than\na cough, dysentery but a looseness, the pleurisy but a stitch; and, as\nthey gently name them, so they patiently endure them; they are very great\nand grievous indeed when they hinder their ordinary labour; they never\nkeep their beds but to die:\n\n          \u201cSimplex illa et aperta virtus in obscuram et solertem\n          scientiam versa est.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThat overt and simple virtue is converted into an obscure and\n     subtle science.\u201d--Seneca, Ep., 95.]\n\nI was writing this about the time when a great load of our intestine\ntroubles for several months lay with all its weight upon me; I had the\nenemy at my door on one side, and the freebooters, worse enemies, on the\nother,\n\n               \u201cNon armis, sed vitiis, certatur;\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThe fight is not with arms, but with vices.\u201d--Seneca, Ep. 95.]\n\nand underwent all sorts of military injuries at once:\n\n         \u201cHostis adest dextra laevaque a parte timendus.\n          Vicinoque malo terret utrumque latus.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cRight and left a formidable enemy is to be feared, and threatens\n     me on both sides with impending danger.\u201d--Ovid, De Ponto, i. 3, 57.]\n\nA monstrous war!  Other wars are bent against strangers, this against\nitself, destroying itself with its own poison.  It is of so malignant and\nruinous a nature, that it ruins itself with the rest; and with its own\nrage mangles and tears itself to pieces.  We more often see it dissolve\nof itself than through scarcity of any necessary thing or by force of the\nenemy.  All discipline evades it; it comes to compose sedition, and is\nitself full of it; would chastise disobedience, and itself is the\nexample; and, employed for the defence of the laws, rebels against its\nown.  What a condition are we in!  Our physic makes us sick!\n\n                    \u201cNostre mal s\u2019empoisonne\n                    Du secours qu\u2019on luy donne.\u201d\n\n               \u201cExuperat magis, aegrescitque medendo.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cOur disease is poisoned with its very remedies\u201d--AEnead, xii. 46.]\n\n               \u201cOmnia fanda, nefanda, malo permista furore,\n               Justificam nobis mentem avertere deorum.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cRight and wrong, all shuffled together in this wicked fury, have\n     deprived us of the gods\u2019 protection.\u201d\n      --Catullus, De Nuptiis Pelei et Thetidos, V. 405.]\n\nIn the beginning of these popular maladies, one may distinguish the sound\nfrom the sick; but when they come to continue, as ours have done, the\nwhole body is then infected from head to foot; no part is free from\ncorruption, for there is no air that men so greedily draw in that\ndiffuses itself so soon and that penetrates so deep as that of licence.\nOur armies only subsist and are kept together by the cement of\nforeigners; for of Frenchmen there is now no constant and regular army to\nbe made.  What a shame it is! there is no longer any discipline but what\nwe see in the mercenary soldiers.  As to ourselves, our conduct is at\ndiscretion, and that not of the chief, but every one at his own.  The\ngeneral has a harder game to play within than he has without; he it is\nwho has to follow, to court the soldiers, to give way to them; he alone\nhas to obey: all the rest if disolution and free licence.  It pleases me\nto observe how much pusillanimity and cowardice there is in ambition; by\nhow abject and servile ways it must arrive at its end; but it displeases\nme to see good and generous natures, and that are capable of justice,\nevery day corrupted in the management and command of this confusion.\nLong toleration begets habit; habit, consent and imitation.  We had\nill-formed souls enough, without spoiling those that were generous and\ngood; so that, if we hold on, there will scarcely remain any with whom to\nintrust the health of this State of ours, in case fortune chance to\nrestore it:\n\n              \u201cHunc saltem everso juvenem succurrere seclo,\n               Ne prohibete.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cForbid not, at least, that this young man repair this ruined age.\u201d\n      --Virgil, Georg., i.  500.  Montaigne probably refers to Henry, king\n     of Navarre, afterwards Henry IV.]\n\nWhat has become of the old precept, \u201cThat soldiers ought more to fear\ntheir chief than the enemy\u201d?--[Valerius Maximus, Ext. 2.]--and of that\nwonderful example, that an orchard being enclosed within the precincts of\na camp of the Roman army, was seen at their dislodgment the next day in\nthe same condition, not an apple, though ripe and delicious, being pulled\noff, but all left to the possessor?  I could wish that our youth, instead\nof the time they spend in less fruitful travels and less honourable\nemployments, would bestow one half of that time in being an eye-witness\nof naval exploits, under some good captain of Rhodes, and the other half\nin observing the discipline of the Turkish armies; for they have many\ndifferences and advantages over ours; one of these is, that our soldiers\nbecome more licentious in expeditions, theirs more temperate and\ncircumspect; for the thefts and insolencies committed upon the common\npeople, which are only punished with a cudgel in peace, are capital in\nwar; for an egg taken by a Turkish soldier without paying for it, fifty\nblows with a stick is the fixed rate; for anything else, of what sort or\nhow trivial soever, not necessary to nourishment, they are presently\nimpaled or beheaded without mercy.  I am astonished, in the history of\nSelim, the most cruel conqueror that ever was, to see that when he\nsubdued Egypt, the beautiful gardens about Damascus being all open, and\nin a conquered land, and his army encamped upon the very place, should be\nleft untouched by the hands of the soldiers, by reason they had not\nreceived the signal of pillage.\n\nBut is there any disease in a government that it is worth while to physic\nwith such a mortal drug?--[i.e.  as civil war.]--No, said Favonius, not\neven the tyrannical usurpation of a Commonwealth.  Plato, likewise, will\nnot consent that a man should violate the peace of his country in order\nto cure it, and by no means approves of a reformation that disturbs and\nhazards all, and that is to be purchased at the price of the citizens\u2019\nblood and ruin; determining it to be the duty of a good patriot in such a\ncase to let it alone, and only to pray to God for his extraordinary\nassistance: and he seems to be angry with his great friend Dion, for\nhaving proceeded somewhat after another manner.  I was a Platonist in\nthis point before I knew there had ever been such a man as Plato in the\nworld.  And if this person ought absolutely to be rejected from our\nsociety (he who by the sincerity of his conscience merited from the\ndivine favour to penetrate so far into the Christian light, through the\nuniversal darkness wherein the world was involved in his time), I do not\nthink it becomes us to suffer ourselves to be instructed by a heathen,\nhow great an impiety it is not to expect from God any relief simply his\nown and without our co-operation.  I often doubt, whether amongst so many\nmen as meddle in such affairs, there is not to be found some one of so\nweak understanding as to have been really persuaded that he went towards\nreformation by the worst of deformations; and advanced towards salvation\nby the most express causes that we have of most assured damnation; that\nby overthrowing government, the magistracy, and the laws, in whose\nprotection God has placed him, by dismembering his good mother, and\ngiving her limbs to be mangled by her old enemies, filling fraternal\nhearts with parricidal hatreds, calling devils and furies to his aid, he\ncan assist the most holy sweetness and justice of the divine law.\nAmbition, avarice, cruelty, and revenge have not sufficient natural\nimpetuosity of their own; let us bait them with the glorious titles of\njustice and devotion.  There cannot a worse state of things be imagined\nthan where wickedness comes to be legitimate, and assumes, with the\nmagistrates\u2019 permission, the cloak of virtue:\n\n          \u201cNihil in speciem fallacius, quam prava religio,\n          ubi deorum numen prxtenditur sceleribus.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cNothing has a more deceiving face than false religion, where the\n     divinity of the gods is obscured by crimes.\u201d--Livy, xxxix. 16.]\n\nThe extremest sort of injustice, according to Plato,  is where that which\nis unjust should be reputed for just.\n\nThe common people then suffered very much, and not present damage only:\n\n                              \u201cUndique totis\n                    Usque adeo turbatur agris,\u201d\n\n          [\u201cSuch great disorders overtake our fields on every side.\u201d\n           --Virgil, Eclog., i. II.]\n\nbut future too; the living were to suffer, and so were they who were yet\nunborn; they stript them, and consequently myself, even of hope, taking\nfrom them all they had laid up in store to live on for many years:\n\n         \u201cQuae nequeunt secum ferre aut abducere, perdunt;\n          Et cremat insontes turba scelesta casas .  .  .\n          Muris nulla fides, squalent populatibus agri.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cWhat they cannot bear away, they spoil; and the wicked mob burn\n     harmless houses; walls cannot secure their masters, and the fields\n     are squalid with devastation.\u201d\n      --Ovid, Trist., iii. 10, 35; Claudianus, In Eutyop., i. 244.]\n\nBesides this shock, I suffered others: I underwent the inconveniences\nthat moderation brings along with it in such a disease: I was robbed on\nall hands; to the Ghibelline I was a Guelph, and to the Guelph a\nGhibelline; one of my poets expresses this very well, but I know not\nwhere it is.\n\n     [\u201cSo Tories called me Whig, and Whigs a Tory.\u201d--Pope, after Horace.]\n\nThe situation of my house, and my friendliness with my neighbours,\npresented me with one face; my life and my actions with another.  They\ndid not lay formal accusations to my charge, for they had no foundation\nfor so doing; I never hide my head from the laws, and whoever would have\nquestioned me, would have done himself a greater prejudice than me; they\nwere only mute suspicions that were whispered about, which never want\nappearance in so confused a mixture, no more than envious or idle heads.\nI commonly myself lend a hand to injurious presumptions that fortune\nscatters abroad against me, by a way I have ever had of evading to\njustify, excuse, or explain myself; conceiving that it were to compromise\nmy conscience to plead in its behalf:\n\n               \u201cPerspicuitas enim argumentatione elevatur;\u201d\n\n     [\u201cFor perspicuity is lessened by argument.\u201d\n      (\u201cThe clearness of a cause is clouded by argumentation.\u201d)\n     --Cicero, De Nat.  Deor., iii.  4.]\n\nand, as if every one saw as clearly into me as I do myself, instead of\nretiring from an accusation, I step up to meet it, and rather give it\nsome kind of colour by an ironical and scoffing confession, if I do not\nsit totally mute, as of a thing not worth my answer.  But such as look\nupon this kind of behaviour of mine as too haughty a confidence, have as\nlittle kindness for me as they who interpret the weakness of an\nindefensible cause; namely, the great folks, towards whom want of\nsubmission is the great fault, harsh towards all justice that knows and\nfeels itself, and is not submissive humble, and suppliant; I have often\nknocked my head against this pillar.  So it is that at what then befell\nme, an ambitious man would have hanged himself, and a covetous man would\nhave done the same.  I have no manner of care of getting;\n\n         \u201cSi mihi, quod nunc est, etiam minus; et mihi vivam\n          Quod superest aevi, si quid superesse volent dii:\u201d\n\n     [\u201cIf I may have what I now own, or even less, and may live for\n     myself what of life remains, if the gods grant me remaining years.\u201d\n      --Horace, Ep., i. 18, 107.]\n\nbut the losses that befall me by the injury of others, whether by theft\nor violence, go almost as near my heart as they would to that of the most\navaricious man.  The offence troubles me, without comparison, more than\nthe loss.  A thousand several sorts of mischiefs fell upon me in the neck\nof one another; I could more cheerfully have borne them all at once.\n\nI was already considering to whom, amongst my friends, I might commit a\nnecessitous and discredited old age; and having turned my eyes quite\nround, I found myself bare.  To let one\u2019s self fall plump down, and from\nso great a height, it ought to be in the arms of a solid, vigorous, and\nfortunate friendship: these are very rare, if there be any.  At last, I\nsaw that it was safest for me to trust to myself in my necessity; and if\nit should so fall out, that I should be but upon cold terms in Fortune\u2019s\nfavour, I should so much the more pressingly recommend me to my own, and\nattach myself and look to myself all the more closely.  Men on all\noccasions throw themselves upon foreign assistance to spare their own,\nwhich is alone certain and sufficient to him who knows how therewith to\narm himself.  Every one runs elsewhere, and to the future, forasmuch as\nno one is arrived at himself.  And I was satisfied that they were\nprofitable inconveniences; forasmuch as, first, ill scholars are to be\nadmonished with the rod, when reason will not do, as a crooked piece of\nwood is by fire and straining reduced to straightness.  I have a great\nwhile preached to myself to stick close to my own concerns, and separate\nmyself from the affairs of others; yet I am still turning my eyes aside.\nA bow, a favourable word, a kind look from a great person tempts me; of\nwhich God knows if there is scarcity in these days, and what they\nsignify.  I, moreover, without wrinkling my forehead, hearken to the\npersuasions offered me, to draw me into the marketplace, and so gently\nrefuse, as if I were half willing to be overcome.  Now for so indocile a\nspirit blows are required; this vessel which thus chops and cleaves, and\nis ready to fall one piece from another, must have the hoops forced down\nwith good sound strokes of a mallet.  Secondly, that this accident served\nme for exercise to prepare me for worse, if I, who both by the benefit of\nfortune, and by the condition of my manners, hoped to be among the last,\nshould happen to be one of the first assailed by this storm; instructing\nmyself betimes to constrain my life, and fit it for a new state.  The\ntrue liberty is to be able to do what a man will with himself:\n\n          \u201cPotentissimus est, qui se habet in potestate.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cHe is most potent who is master of himself.\u201d--Seneca, Ep., 94.]\n\nIn an ordinary and quiet time, a man prepares himself for moderate and\ncommon accidents; but in the confusion wherein we have been for these\nthirty years, every Frenchman, whether personal or in general, sees\nhimself every hour upon the point of the total ruin and overthrow of his\nfortune: by so much the more ought he to have his courage supplied with\nthe strongest and most vigorous provisions.  Let us thank fortune, that\nhas not made us live in an effeminate, idle, and languishing age; some\nwho could never have been so by other means will be made famous by their\nmisfortunes.  As I seldom read in histories the confusions of other\nstates without regret that I was not present, the better to consider\nthem, so does my curiosity make me in some sort please myself in seeing\nwith my own eyes this notable spectacle of our public death, its form and\nsymptoms; and since I cannot hinder it, I am content to have been\ndestined to be present therein, and thereby to instruct myself.  So do\nwe eagerly covet to see, though but in shadow and the fables of theatres,\nthe pomp of tragic representations of human fortune; \u2018tis not without\ncompassion at what we hear, but we please ourselves in rousing our\ndispleasure, by the rarity of these pitiable events.  Nothing tickles\nthat does not pinch.  And good historians skip over, as stagnant water\nand dead sea, calm narrations, to return to seditions, to wars, to which\nthey know that we invite them.\n\nI question whether I can decently confess with how small a sacrifice of\nits repose and tranquillity I have passed over above the one half of my\nlife amid the ruin of my country.  I lend myself my patience somewhat too\ncheap, in accidents that do not privately assail me; and do not so much\nregard what they take from me, as what remains safe, both within and\nwithout.  There is comfort in evading, one while this, another while\nthat, of the evils that are levelled at ourselves too, at last, but at\npresent hurt others only about us; as also, that in matters of public\ninterest, the more universally my affection is dispersed, the weaker it\nis: to which may be added, that it is half true:\n\n               \u201cTantum ex publicis malis sentimus,\n               quantum ad privatas res pertinet;\u201d\n\n     [\u201cWe are only so far sensible of public evils as they respect our\n     private affairs.\u201d--Livy, xxx. 44.]\n\nand that the health from which we fell was so ill, that itself relieves\nthe regret we should have for it.  It was health, but only in comparison\nwith the sickness that has succeeded it: we are not fallen from any great\nheight; the corruption and brigandage which are in dignity and office\nseem to me the least supportable: we are less injuriously rifled in a\nwood than in a place of security.  It was an universal juncture of\nparticular members, each corrupted by emulation of the others, and most\nof them with old ulcers, that neither received nor required any cure.\nThis convulsion, therefore, really more animated than pressed me, by the\nassistance of my conscience, which was not only at peace within itself,\nbut elevated, and I did not find any reason to complain of myself.  Also,\nas God never sends evils, any more than goods, absolutely pure to men,\nmy health continued at that time more than usually good; and, as I can\ndo nothing without it, there are few things that I cannot do with it.\nIt afforded me means to rouse up all my faculties, and to lay my hand\nbefore the wound that would else, peradventure, have gone farther; and I\nexperienced, in my patience, that I had some stand against fortune, and\nthat it must be a great shock could throw me out of the saddle.  I do not\nsay this to provoke her to give me a more vigorous charge: I am her\nhumble servant, and submit to her pleasure: let her be content, in God\u2019s\nname.  Am I sensible of her assaults?  Yes, I am. But, as those who are\npossessed and oppressed with sorrow sometimes suffer themselves,\nnevertheless, by intervals to taste a little pleasure, and are sometimes\nsurprised with a smile, so have I so much power over myself, as to make\nmy ordinary condition quiet and free from disturbing thoughts; yet I\nsuffer myself, withal, by fits to be surprised with the stings of those\nunpleasing imaginations that assault me, whilst I am arming myself to\ndrive them away, or at least to wrestle with them.\n\nBut behold another aggravation of the evil which befell me in the tail of\nthe rest: both without doors and within I was assailed with a most\nviolent plague, violent in comparison of all others; for as sound bodies\nare subject to more grievous maladies, forasmuch as they, are not to be\nforced but by such, so my very healthful air, where no contagion, however\nnear, in the memory of man, ever took footing, coming to be corrupted,\nproduced strange effects:\n\n         \u201cMista senum et juvenum densentur funera; nullum\n          Saeva caput Proserpina fugit;\u201d\n\n     [\u201cOld and young die in mixed heaps.  Cruel Proserpine forbears\n     none.\u201d--Horace, Od., i. 28, 19.]\n\nI had to suffer this pleasant condition, that the sight of my house, was\nfrightful to me; whatever I had there was without guard, and left to the\nmercy of any one who wished to take it.  I myself, who am so hospitable,\nwas in very great distress for a retreat for my family; a distracted\nfamily, frightful both to its friends and itself, and filling every place\nwith horror where it attempted to settle, having to shift its abode so\nsoon as any one\u2019s finger began but to ache; all diseases are then\nconcluded to be the plague, and people do not stay to examine whether\nthey are so or no.  And the mischief on\u2019t is that, according to the rules\nof art, in every danger that a man comes near, he must undergo a\nquarantine in fear of the evil, your imagination all the while tormenting\nyou at pleasure, and turning even your health itself into a fever.  Yet\nall this would have much less affected me had I not withal been compelled\nto be sensible of the sufferings of others, and miserably to serve six\nmonths together for a guide to this caravan; for I carry my own antidotes\nwithin myself, which are resolution and patience.  Apprehension, which is\nparticularly feared in this disease, does not much trouble me; and, if\nbeing alone, I should have been taken, it had been a less cheerless and\nmore remote departure; \u2018tis a kind of death that I do not think of the\nworst sort; \u2018tis commonly short, stupid, without pain, and consoled by\nthe public condition; without ceremony, without mourning, without a\ncrowd.  But as to the people about us, the hundredth part of them could\nnot be saved:\n\n              \u201cVideas desertaque regna\n               Pastorum, et longe saltus lateque vacantes.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cYou would see shepherds\u2019 haunts deserted, and far and wide empty\n     pastures.\u201d--Virgil, Georg., iii. 476.]\n\nIn this place my largest revenue is manual: what an hundred men ploughed\nfor me, lay a long time fallow.\n\nBut then, what example of resolution did we not see in the simplicity of\nall this people?  Generally, every one renounced all care of life; the\ngrapes, the principal wealth of the country, remained untouched upon the\nvines; every man indifferently prepared for and expected death, either\nto-night or to-morrow, with a countenance and voice so far from fear,\nas if they had come to terms with this necessity, and that it was an\nuniversal and inevitable sentence.  \u2018Tis always such; but how slender\nhold has the resolution of dying?  The distance and difference of a few\nhours, the sole consideration of company, renders its apprehension\nvarious to us.  Observe these people; by reason that they die in the same\nmonth, children, young people, and old, they are no longer astonished at\nit; they no longer lament.  I saw some who were afraid of staying behind,\nas in a dreadful solitude; and I did not commonly observe any other\nsolicitude amongst them than that of sepulture; they were troubled to see\nthe dead bodies scattered about the fields, at the mercy of the wild\nbeasts that presently flocked thither.  How differing are the fancies of\nmen; the Neorites, a nation subjected by Alexander, threw the bodies of\ntheir dead into the deepest and less frequented part of their woods, on\npurpose to have them there eaten; the only sepulture reputed happy\namongst them.  Some, who were yet in health, dug their own graves; others\nlaid themselves down in them whilst alive; and a labourer of mine, in\ndying, with his hands and feet pulled the earth upon him.  Was not this\nto nestle and settle himself to sleep at greater ease?  A bravery in some\nsort like that of the Roman soldiers who, after the battle of Cannae,\nwere found with their heads thrust into holes in the earth, which they\nhad made, and in suffocating themselves, with their own hands pulled the\nearth about their ears.  In short, a whole province was, by the common\nusage, at once brought to a course nothing inferior in undauntedness to\nthe most studied and premeditated resolution.\n\nMost of the instructions of science to encourage us herein have in them\nmore of show than of force, and more of ornament than of effect.  We have\nabandoned Nature, and will teach her what to do; teach her who so happily\nand so securely conducted us; and in the meantime, from the footsteps of\nher instruction, and that little which, by the benefit of ignorance,\nremains of her image imprinted in the life of this rustic rout of\nunpolished men, science is constrained every day to borrow patterns for\nher disciples of constancy, tranquillity, and innocence.  It is pretty to\nsee that these persons, full of so much fine knowledge, have to imitate\nthis foolish simplicity, and this in the primary actions of virtue; and\nthat our wisdom must learn even from beasts the most profitable\ninstructions in the greatest and most necessary concerns of our life;\nas, how we are to live and die, manage our property, love and bring up\nour children, maintain justice: a singular testimony of human infirmity;\nand that this reason we so handle at our pleasure, finding evermore some\ndiversity and novelty, leaves in us no apparent trace of nature.  Men\nhave done with nature as perfumers with oils; they have sophisticated her\nwith so many argumentations and far-fetched discourses, that she is\nbecome variable and particular to each, and has lost her proper,\nconstant, and universal face; so that we must seek testimony from beasts,\nnot subject to favour, corruption, or diversity of opinions.  It is,\nindeed, true that even these themselves do not always go exactly in the\npath of nature, but wherein they swerve, it is so little that you may\nalways see the track; as horses that are led make many bounds and\ncurvets, but \u2018tis always at the length of the halter, and still follow\nhim that leads them; and as a young hawk takes its flight, but still\nunder the restraint of its tether:\n\n          \u201cExsilia, torments, bells, morbos, naufragia meditare .  .  .\n          ut nullo sis malo tiro.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cTo meditate upon banishments, tortures, wars, diseases, and\n     shipwrecks, that thou mayest not be a novice in any disaster.\u201d\n      --Seneca, Ep., 91, 107.]\n\nWhat good will this curiosity do us, to anticipate all the inconveniences\nof human nature, and to prepare ourselves with so much trouble against\nthings which, peradventure, will never befall us?\n\n          \u201cParem passis tristitiam facit, pati posse;\u201d\n\n          [\u201cIt troubles men as much that they may possibly suffer,\n          as if they really did suffer.\u201d--Idem, ibid., 74.]\n\nnot only the blow, but the wind of the blow strikes us: or, like\nphrenetic people--for certainly it is a phrensy--to go immediately and\nwhip yourself, because it may so fall out that Fortune may one day make\nyou undergo it; and to put on your furred gown at Midsummer, because you\nwill stand in need of it at Christmas!  Throw yourselves, say they, into\nthe experience of all the evils, the most extreme evils that can possibly\nbefall you, and so be assured of them.  On the contrary, the most easy\nand most natural way would be to banish even the thoughts of them; they\nwill not come soon enough; their true being will not continue with us\nlong enough; our mind must lengthen and extend them; we must incorporate\nthem in us beforehand, and there entertain them, as if they would not\notherwise sufficiently press upon our senses.  \u201cWe shall find them heavy\nenough when they come,\u201d says one of our masters, of none of the tender\nsects, but of the most severe; \u201cin the meantime, favour thyself; believe\nwhat pleases thee best; what good will it do thee to anticipate thy ill\nfortune, to lose the present for fear of the future: and to make thyself\nmiserable now, because thou art to be so in time?\u201d  These are his words.\nScience, indeed, does us one good office in instructing us exactly as to\nthe dimensions of evils,\n\n                    \u201cCuris acuens mortalia corda!\u201d\n\n     [\u201cProbing mortal hearts with cares.\u201d--Virgil, Georg., i. 23.]\n\n\u2018Twere pity that any part of their greatness should escape our sense and\nknowledge.\n\n\u2018Tis certain that for the most part the preparation for death has\nadministered more torment than the thing itself.  It was of old truly\nsaid, and by a very judicious author:\n\n          \u201cMinus afficit sensus fatigatio, quam cogitatio.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cSuffering itself less afflicts the senses than the apprehension\n     of suffering.\u201d--Quintilian, Inst. Orat., i. 12.]\n\nThe sentiment of present death sometimes, of itself, animates us with a\nprompt resolution not to avoid a thing that is utterly inevitable: many\ngladiators have been seen in the olden time, who, after having fought\ntimorously and ill, have courageously entertained death, offering their\nthroats to the enemies\u2019 sword and bidding them despatch.  The sight of\nfuture death requires a courage that is slow, and consequently hard to be\ngot.  If you know not how to die, never trouble yourself; nature will, at\nthe time, fully and sufficiently instruct you: she will exactly do that\nbusiness for you; take you no care--\n\n              \u201cIncertam frustra, mortales, funeris horam,\n               Quaeritis et qua sit mors aditura via....\n               Poena minor certam subito perferre ruinam;\n               Quod timeas, gravius sustinuisse diu.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cMortals, in vain you seek to know the uncertain hour of death,\n     and by what channel it will come upon you.\u201d--Propertius, ii. 27, 1.\n     \u201c\u2018Tis less painful to undergo sudden destruction; \u2018tis hard to bear\n     that which you long fear.\u201d--Incert. Auct.]\n\nWe trouble life by the care of death, and death by the care of life: the\none torments, the other frights us.  It is not against death that we\nprepare, that is too momentary a thing; a quarter of an hour\u2019s suffering,\nwithout consequence and without damage, does not deserve especial\nprecepts: to say the truth, we prepare ourselves against the preparations\nof death.  Philosophy ordains that we should always have death before our\neyes, to see and consider it before the time, and then gives us rules and\nprecautions to provide that this foresight and thought do us no harm;\njust so do physicians, who throw us into diseases, to the end they may\nhave whereon to employ their drugs and their art.  If we have not known\nhow to live, \u2018tis injustice to teach us how to die, and make the end\ndifform from all the rest; if we have known how to live firmly and\nquietly, we shall know how to die so too.  They may boast as much as they\nplease:\n\n          \u201cTota philosophorum vita commentatio mortis est;\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThe whole life of philosophers is the meditation of death.\u201d\n      --Cicero, Tusc.  Quaes., ii. 30.]\n\nbut I fancy that, though it be the end, it is not the aim of life; \u2018tis\nits end, its extremity, but not, nevertheless, its object; it ought\nitself to be its own aim and design; its true study is to order, govern,\nand suffer itself.  In the number of several other offices, that the\ngeneral and principal chapter of Knowing how to live comprehends, is this\narticle of Knowing how to die; and, did not our fears give it weight,\none of the lightest too.\n\nTo judge of them by utility and by the naked truth, the lessons of\nsimplicity are not much inferior to those which learning teaches us: nay,\nquite the contrary.  Men differ in sentiment and force; we must lead them\nto their own good according to their capacities and by various ways:\n\n          \u201cQuo me comque rapit tempestas, deferor hospes.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cWherever the season takes me,(where the tempest drives me)\n     there I am carried as a guest.\u201d--Horace, Ep., i. i, 15.]\n\nI never saw any peasant among my neighbours cogitate with what\ncountenance and assurance he should pass over his last hour; nature\nteaches him not to think of death till he is dying; and then he does it\nwith a better grace than Aristotle, upon whom death presses with a double\nweight, both of itself and from so long a premeditation; and, therefore,\nit was the opinion of Caesar, that the least premeditated death was the\neasiest and the most happy:\n\n     \u201cPlus dolet quam necesse est, qui ante dolet, quam necesse est.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cHe grieves more than is necessary, who grieves before it is\n     necessary.\u201d--Seneca, Ep., 98.]\n\nThe sharpness of this imagination springs from our curiosity: \u2018tis thus\nwe ever impede ourselves, desiring to anticipate and regulate natural\nprescripts.  It is only for the doctors to dine worse for it, when in the\nbest health, and to frown at the image of death; the common sort stand in\nneed of no remedy or consolation, but just in the shock, and when the\nblow comes; and consider on\u2019t no more than just what they endure.  Is it\nnot then, as we say, that the stolidity and want of apprehension in the\nvulgar give them that patience m present evils, and that profound\ncarelessness of future sinister accidents?  That their souls, in being\nmore gross and dull, are less penetrable and not so easily moved?  If it\nbe so, let us henceforth, in God\u2019s name, teach nothing but ignorance;\n\u2018tis the utmost fruit the sciences promise us, to which this stolidity so\ngently leads its disciples.\n\nWe have no want of good masters, interpreters of natural simplicity.\nSocrates shall be one; for, as I remember, he speaks something to this\npurpose to the judges who sat upon his life and death.\n\n     [That which follows is taken from the Apology of Socrates in Plato,\n     chap.  17, &c.]\n\n\u201cI am afraid, my masters, that if I entreat you not to put me to death, I\nshall confirm the charge of my accusers, which is, that I pretend to be\nwiser than others, as having some more secret knowledge of things that\nare above and below us.  I have neither frequented nor known death, nor\nhave ever seen any person that has tried its qualities, from whom to\ninform myself.  Such as fear it, presuppose they know it; as for my part,\nI neither know what it is, nor what they do in the other world.  Death\nis, peradventure, an indifferent thing; peradventure, a thing to be\ndesired.  \u2018Tis nevertheless to be believed, if it be a transmigration\nfrom one place to another, that it is a bettering of one\u2019s condition to\ngo and live with so many great persons deceased, and to be exempt from\nhaving any more to do with unjust and corrupt judges; if it be an\nannihilation of our being, \u2018tis yet a bettering of one\u2019s condition to\nenter into a long and peaceable night; we find nothing more sweet in life\nthan quiet repose and a profound sleep without dreams.  The things that\nI know to be evil, as to injure one\u2019s neighbour and to disobey one\u2019s\nsuperior, whether it be God or man, I carefully avoid; such as I do not\nknow whether they be good or evil, I cannot fear them.  If I am to die\nand leave you alive, the gods alone only know whether it will go better\nwith you or with me.  Wherefore, as to what concerns me, you may do as\nyou shall think fit.  But according to my method of advising just and\nprofitable things, I say that you will do your consciences more right to\nset me at liberty, unless you see further into my cause than I do; and,\njudging according to my past actions, both public and private, according\nto my intentions, and according to the profit that so many of our\ncitizens, both young and old, daily extract from my conversation, and the\nfruit that you all reap from me, you cannot more duly acquit yourselves\ntowards my merit than in ordering that, my poverty considered, I should\nbe maintained at the Prytanaeum, at the public expense, a thing that I\nhave often known you, with less reason, grant to others.  Do not impute\nit to obstinacy or disdain that I do not, according to the custom,\nsupplicate and go about to move you to commiseration.  I have both\nfriends and kindred, not being, as Homer says, begotten of wood or of\nstone, no more than others, who might well present themselves before you\nwith tears and mourning, and I have three desolate children with whom to\nmove you to compassion; but I should do a shame to our city at the age I\nam, and in the reputation of wisdom which is now charged against me, to\nappear in such an abject form.  What would men say of the other\nAthenians?  I have always admonished those who have frequented my\nlectures, not to redeem their lives by an unbecoming action; and in the\nwars of my country, at Amphipolis, Potidea, Delia, and other expeditions\nwhere I have been, I have effectually manifested how far I was from\nsecuring my safety by my shame.  I should, moreover, compromise your\nduty, and should invite you to unbecoming things; for \u2018tis not for my\nprayers to persuade you, but for the pure and solid reasons of justice.\nYou have sworn to the gods to keep yourselves upright; and it would seem\nas if I suspected you, or would recriminate upon you that I do not\nbelieve that you are so; and I should testify against myself, not to\nbelieve them as I ought, mistrusting their conduct, and not purely\ncommitting my affair into their hands.  I wholly rely upon them; and hold\nmyself assured they will do in this what shall be most fit both for you\nand for me: good men, whether living or dead, have no reason to fear the\ngods.\u201d\n\nIs not this an innocent child\u2019s pleading of an unimaginable loftiness,\ntrue, frank, and just, unexampled?--and in what a necessity employed!\nTruly, he had very good reason to prefer it before that which the great\norator Lysias had penned for him: admirably couched, indeed, in the\njudiciary style, but unworthy of so noble a criminal.  Had a suppliant\nvoice been heard out of the mouth of Socrates, that lofty virtue had\nstruck sail in the height of its glory; and ought his rich and powerful\nnature to have committed her defence to art, and, in her highest proof,\nhave renounced truth and simplicity, the ornaments of his speaking, to\nadorn and deck herself with the embellishments of figures and the\nflourishes of a premeditated speech?  He did very wisely, and like\nhimself, not to corrupt the tenor of an incorrupt life, and so sacred an\nimage of the human form, to spin out his decrepitude another year, and to\nbetray the immortal memory of that glorious end.  He owed his life not to\nhimself, but to the example of the world; had it not been a public\ndamage, that he should have concluded it after a lazy and obscure manner?\nAssuredly, that careless and indifferent consideration of his death\ndeserved that posterity should consider it so much the more, as indeed\nthey did; and there is nothing so just in justice than that which fortune\nordained for his recommendation; for the Athenians abominated all those\nwho had been causers of his death to such a degree, that they avoided\nthem as excommunicated persons, and looked upon everything as polluted\nthat had been touched by them; no one would wash with them in the public\nbaths, none would salute or own acquaintance with them: so that, at last,\nunable longer to support this public hatred, they hanged themselves.\n\nIf any one shall think that, amongst so many other examples that I had to\nchoose out of in the sayings of Socrates for my present purpose, I have\nmade an ill choice of this, and shall judge this discourse of his\nelevated above common conceptions, I must tell them that I have properly\nselected it; for I am of another opinion, and hold it to be a discourse,\nin rank and simplicity, much below and behind common conceptions.  He\nrepresents, in an inartificial boldness and infantine security, the pure\nand first impression and ignorance of nature; for it is to be believed\nthat we have naturally a fear of pain, but not of death, by reason of\nitself; \u2018tis a part of our being, and no less essential than living.\n\nTo what end should nature have begotten in us a hatred to it and a horror\nof it, considering that it is of so great utility to her in maintaining\nthe succession and vicissitude of her works? and that in this universal\nrepublic, it conduces more to birth and augmentation than to loss or\nruin?\n\n                  \u201cSic rerum summa novatur.\u201d\n\n               \u201cMille animas una necata dedit.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe failing of one life is the passage to a thousand other lives.\u201d\n\nNature has imprinted in beasts the care of themselves and of their\nconservation; they proceed so far as hitting or hurting to be timorous of\nbeing worse, of themselves, of our haltering and beating them, accidents\nsubject to their sense and experience; but that we should kill them, they\ncannot fear, nor have they the faculty to imagine and conclude such a\nthing as death; it is said, indeed, that we see them not only cheerfully\nundergo it, horses for the most part neighing and swans singing when they\ndie, but, moreover, seek it at need, of which elephants have given many\nexamples.\n\nBesides, the method of arguing, of which Socrates here makes use, is it\nnot equally admirable both in simplicity and vehemence?  Truly it is much\nmore easy to speak like Aristotle and to live like Caesar than to speak\nand live as Socrates did; there lies the extreme degree of perfection and\ndifficulty; art cannot reach it.  Now, our faculties are not so trained\nup; we do not try, we do not know them; we invest ourselves with those of\nothers, and let our own lie idle; as some one may say of me, that I have\nhere only made a nosegay of foreign flowers, having furnished nothing of\nmy own but the thread to tie them.\n\nCertainly I have so far yielded to public opinion, that those borrowed\nornaments accompany me; but I do not mean that they shall cover me and\nhide me; that is quite contrary to my design, who desire to make a show\nof nothing but what is my own, and what is my own by nature; and had I\ntaken my own advice, I had at all hazards spoken purely alone, I more and\nmore load myself every day,\n\n     [In fact, the first edition of the Essays (Bordeaux, 1580) has very\n     few quotations.  These became more numerous in the edition of 1588;\n     but the multitude of classical texts which at times encumber\n     Montaigne\u2019s text, only dates from the posthumous edition of 1595, he\n     had made these collections in the four last years of his life, as an\n     amusement of his \u201cidleness.\u201d--Le Clerc.  They grow, however, more\n     sparing in the Third Book.]\n\nbeyond my purpose and first method, upon the account of idleness and the\nhumour of the age.  If it misbecome me, as I believe it does, \u2018tis no\nmatter; it may be of use to some others.  Such there are who quote Plato\nand Homer, who never saw either of them; and I also have taken things out\nof places far enough distant from their source.  Without pains and\nwithout learning, having a thousand volumes about me in the place where I\nwrite, I can presently borrow, if I please, from a dozen such\nscrap-gatherers, people about whom I do not much trouble myself, wherewith\nto trick up this treatise of Physiognomy; there needs no more but a\npreliminary epistle of a German to stuff me with quotations.  And so it\nis we go in quest of a tickling story to cheat the foolish world.  These\nlumber pies of commonplaces, wherewith so many furnish their studies, are\nof little use but to common subjects, and serve but to show us, and not\nto direct us: a ridiculous fruit of learning, that Socrates so pleasantly\ndiscusses against Euthydemus.  I have seen books made of things that were\nnever either studied or understood; the author committing to several of\nhis learned friends the examination of this and t\u2019other matter to compile\nit, contenting himself, for his share, with having projected the design,\nand by his industry to have tied together this faggot of unknown\nprovisions; the ink and paper, at least, are his.  This is to buy or\nborrow a book, and not to make one; \u2018tis to show men not that he can make\na book, but that, whereof they may be in doubt, he cannot make one.\nA president, where I was, boasted that he had amassed together two\nhundred and odd commonplaces in one of his judgments; in telling which,\nhe deprived himself of the glory he had got by it: in my opinion, a\npusillanimous and absurd vanity for such a subject and such a person.\nI do the contrary; and amongst so many borrowed things, am glad if I can\nsteal one, disguising and altering it for some new service; at the hazard\nof having it said that \u2018tis for want of understanding its natural use;\nI give it some particular touch of my own hand, to the end it may not be\nso absolutely foreign.  These set their thefts in show and value\nthemselves upon them, and so have more credit with the laws than I have:\nwe naturalists I think that there is a great and incomparable preference\nin the honour of invention over that of allegation.\n\nIf I would have spoken by learning, I had spoken sooner; I had written of\nthe time nearer to my studies, when I had more wit and better memory, and\nshould sooner have trusted to the vigour of that age than of this, would\nI have made a business of writing.  And what if this gracious favour\n--[His acquaintance with Mademoiselle de Gournay.]--which Fortune has\nlately offered me upon the account of this work, had befallen me in that\ntime of my life, instead of this, wherein \u2018tis equally desirable to\npossess, soon to be lost!  Two of my acquaintance, great men in this\nfaculty, have, in my opinion, lost half, in refusing to publish at forty\nyears old, that they might stay till threescore.  Maturity has its\ndefects as well as green years, and worse; and old age is as unfit for\nthis kind of business as any other.  He who commits his decrepitude to\nthe press plays the fool if he think to squeeze anything out thence that\ndoes not relish of dreaming, dotage, and drivelling; the mind grows\ncostive and thick in growing old.  I deliver my ignorance in pomp and\nstate, and my learning meagrely and poorly; this accidentally and\naccessorily, that principally and expressly; and write specifically of\nnothing but nothing, nor of any science but of that inscience.  I have\nchosen a time when my life, which I am to give an account of, lies wholly\nbefore me; what remains has more to do with death; and of my death\nitself, should I find it a prating death, as others do, I would willingly\ngive an account at my departure.\n\nSocrates was a perfect exemplar in all great qualities, and I am vexed\nthat he had so deformed a face and body as is said, and so unsuitable to\nthe beauty of his soul, himself being so amorous and such an admirer of\nbeauty: Nature did him wrong.  There is nothing more probable than the\nconformity and relation of the body to the soul:\n\n     \u201cIpsi animi magni refert, quali in corpore locati sint: multo enim a\n     corpore existunt, qux acuant mentem: multa qua obtundant;\u201d\n\n     [\u201cIt is of great consequence in what bodies minds are placed, for\n     many things spring from the body that may sharpen the mind, and many\n     that may blunt it.\u201d--Cicero, Tusc.  Quaes., i. 33.]\n\nthis refers to an unnatural ugliness and deformity of limbs; but we call\nugliness also an unseemliness at first sight, which is principally lodged\nin the face, and disgusts us on very slight grounds: by the complexion, a\nspot, a rugged countenance, for some reasons often wholly inexplicable,\nin members nevertheless of good symmetry and perfect.  The deformity,\nthat clothed a very beautiful soul in La Boetie, was of this predicament:\nthat superficial ugliness, which nevertheless is always the most\nimperious, is of least prejudice to the state of the mind, and of little\ncertainty in the opinion of men.  The other, which is never properly\ncalled deformity, being more substantial, strikes deeper in.  Not every\nshoe of smooth shining leather, but every shoe well-made, shews the shape\nof the foot within.  As Socrates said of his, it betrayed equal ugliness\nin his soul, had he not corrected it by education; but in saying so, I\nhold he was in jest, as his custom was; never so excellent a soul formed\nitself.\n\nI cannot often enough repeat how great an esteem I have for beauty, that\npotent and advantageous quality; he (La Boetie) called it \u201ca short\ntyranny,\u201d and Plato, \u201cthe privilege of nature.\u201d  We have nothing that\nexcels it in reputation; it has the first place in the commerce of men;\nit presents itself in the front; seduces and prepossesses our judgments\nwith great authority and wonderful impression.  Phryne had lost her cause\nin the hands of an excellent advocate, if, opening her robe, she had not\ncorrupted her judges by the lustre of her beauty.  And I find that Cyrus,\nAlexander, and Caesar, the three masters of the world, never neglected\nbeauty in their greatest affairs; no more did the first Scipio.  The same\nword in Greek signifies both fair and good; and the Holy Word often says\ngood when it means fair: I should willingly maintain the priority in good\nthings, according to the song that Plato calls an idle thing, taken out\nof some ancient poet: \u201chealth, beauty, riches.\u201d  Aristotle says that the\nright of command appertains to the beautiful; and that, when there is a\nperson whose beauty comes near the images of the gods, veneration is\nequally due to him.  To him who asked why people oftener and longer\nfrequent the company of handsome persons: \u201cThat question,\u201d said he, \u201cis\nonly to be asked by the blind.\u201d  Most of the philosophers, and the\ngreatest, paid for their schooling, and acquired wisdom by the favour and\nmediation of their beauty.  Not only in the men that serve me, but also\nin the beasts, I consider it within two fingers\u2019 breadth of goodness.\n\nAnd yet I fancy that those features and moulds of face, and those\nlineaments, by which men guess at our internal complexions and our\nfortunes to come, is a thing that does not very directly and simply lie\nunder the chapter of beauty and deformity, no more than every good odour\nand serenity of air promises health, nor all fog and stink infection in a\ntime of pestilence.  Such as accuse ladies of contradicting their beauty\nby their manners, do not always hit right; for, in a face which is none\nof the best, there may dwell some air of probity and trust; as, on the\ncontrary, I have read, betwixt two beautiful eyes, menaces of a dangerous\nand malignant nature.  There are favourable physiognomies, so that in a\ncrowd of victorious enemies, you shall presently choose, amongst men you\nnever saw before, one rather than another to whom to surrender, and with\nwhom to intrust your life; and yet not properly upon the consideration of\nbeauty.\n\nA person\u2019s look is but a feeble warranty; and yet it is something\nconsiderable too; and if I had to lash them, I would most severely\nscourge the wicked ones who belie and betray the promises that nature has\nplanted in their foreheads; I should with greater severity punish malice\nunder a mild and gentle aspect.  It seems as if there were some lucky and\nsome unlucky faces; and I believe there is some art in distinguishing\naffable from merely simple faces, severe from rugged, malicious from\npensive, scornful from melancholic, and such other bordering qualities.\nThere are beauties which are not only haughty, but sour, and others that\nare not only gentle, but more than that, insipid; to prognosticate from\nthem future events is a matter that I shall leave undecided.\n\nI have, as I have said elsewhere as to my own concern, simply and\nimplicitly embraced this ancient rule, \u201cThat we cannot fail in following\nNature,\u201d and that the sovereign precept is to conform ourselves to her.\nI have not, as Socrates did, corrected my natural composition by the\nforce of reason, and have not in the least disturbed my inclination by\nart; I have let myself go as I came: I contend not; my two principal\nparts live, of their own accord, in peace and good intelligence, but my\nnurse\u2019s milk, thank God, was tolerably wholesome and good.  Shall I say\nthis by the way, that I see in greater esteem than \u2018tis worth, and in use\nsolely among ourselves, a certain image of scholastic probity, a slave to\nprecepts, and fettered with hope and fear?  I would have it such as that\nlaws and religions should not make, but perfect and authorise it; that\nfinds it has wherewithal to support itself without help, born and rooted\nin us from the seed of universal reason, imprinted in every man by\nnature.  That reason which strengthens Socrates from his vicious bend\nrenders him obedient to the gods and men of authority in his city:\ncourageous in death, not because his soul is immortal, but because he is\nmortal.  \u2018Tis a doctrine ruinous to all government, and much more hurtful\nthan ingenious and subtle, which persuades the people that a religious\nbelief is alone sufficient, and without conduct, to satisfy the divine\njustice.  Use demonstrates to us a vast distinction betwixt devotion and\nconscience.\n\nI have a favourable aspect, both in form and in interpretation:\n\n               \u201cQuid dixi, habere me? imo habui, Chreme.\u201d\n\n          [\u201cWhat did I say?  that I have?  no, Chremes, I had.\u201d\n           --Terence, Heaut., act i., sec. 2, v. 42.]\n\n               \u201cHeu!  tantum attriti corporis ossa vides;\u201d\n\n          [\u201cAlas! of a worn body thou seest only the bones\u201d]\n\nand that makes a quite contrary show to that of Socrates.  It has often\nbefallen me, that upon the mere credit of my presence and air, persons\nwho had no manner of knowledge of me have put a very great confidence in\nme, whether in their own affairs or mine; and I have in foreign parts\nthence obtained singular and rare favours.  But the two following\nexamples are, peradventure, worth particular relation.  A certain person\nplanned to surprise my house and me in it; his scheme was to come to my\ngates alone, and to be importunate to be let in.  I knew him by name,\nand had fair reason to repose confidence in him, as being my neighbour\nand something related to me.  I caused the gates to be opened to him,\nas I do to every one.  There I found him, with every appearance of alarm,\nhis horse panting and very tired.  He entertained me with this story:\n\u201cThat, about half a league off, he had met with a certain enemy of his,\nwhom I also knew, and had heard of their quarrel; that his enemy had\ngiven him a very brisk chase, and that having been surprised in disorder,\nand his party being too weak, he had fled to my gates for refuge;\nand that he was in great trouble for his followers, whom (he said) he\nconcluded to be all either dead or taken.\u201d  I innocently did my best to\ncomfort, assure, and refresh him.  Shortly after came four or five of his\nsoldiers, who presented themselves in the same countenance and affright,\nto get in too; and after them more, and still more, very well mounted and\narmed, to the number of five-and-twenty or thirty, pretending that they\nhad the enemy at their heels.  This mystery began a little to awaken my\nsuspicion; I was not ignorant what an age I lived in, how much my house\nmight be envied, and I had several examples of others of my acquaintance\nto whom a mishap of this sort had happened.  But thinking there was\nnothing to be got by having begun to do a courtesy, unless I went through\nwith it, and that I could not disengage myself from them without spoiling\nall, I let myself go the most natural and simple way, as I always do, and\ninvited them all to come in. And in truth I am naturally very little\ninclined to suspicion and distrust; I willingly incline towards excuse\nand the gentlest interpretation; I take men according to the common\norder, and do not more believe in those perverse and unnatural\ninclinations, unless convinced by manifest evidence, than I do in\nmonsters and miracles; and I am, moreover, a man who willingly commit\nmyself to Fortune, and throw myself headlong into her arms; and I have\nhitherto found more reason to applaud than to blame myself for so doing,\nhaving ever found her more discreet about, and a greater friend to, my\naffairs than I am myself.  There are some actions in my life whereof the\nconduct may justly be called difficult, or, if you please, prudent; of\nthese, supposing the third part to have been my own, doubtless the other\ntwo-thirds were absolutely hers.  We make, methinks, a mistake in that we\ndo not enough trust Heaven with our affairs, and pretend to more from our\nown conduct than appertains to us; and therefore it is that our designs\nso often miscarry. Heaven is jealous of the extent that we attribute to\nthe right of human prudence above its own, and cuts it all the shorter by\nhow much the more we amplify it.  The last comers remained on horseback\nin my courtyard, whilst their leader, who was with me in the parlour,\nwould not have his horse put up in the stable, saying he should\nimmediately retire, so soon as he had news of his men.  He saw himself\nmaster of his enterprise, and nothing now remained but its execution.\nHe has since several times said (for he was not ashamed to tell the story\nhimself) that my countenance and frankness had snatched the treachery out\nof his hands.  He again mounted his horse; his followers, who had their\neyes intent upon him, to see when he would give the signal, being very\nmuch astonished to find him come away and leave his prey behind him.\n\nAnother time, relying upon some truce just published in the army, I took\na journey through a very ticklish country.  I had not ridden far, but I\nwas discovered, and two or three parties of horse, from various places,\nwere sent out to seize me; one of them overtook me on the third day, and\nI was attacked by fifteen or twenty gentlemen in vizors, followed at a\ndistance by a band of foot-soldiers.  I was taken, withdrawn into the\nthick of a neighbouring forest, dismounted, robbed, my trunks rifled, my\nmoney-box taken, and my horses and equipage divided amongst new masters.\nWe had, in this copse, a very long contest about my ransom, which they\nset so high, that it was manifest that I was not known to them.  They\nwere, moreover, in a very great debate about my life; and, in truth,\nthere were various circumstances that clearly showed the danger I was in:\n\n          \u201cTunc animis opus, AEnea, tunc pectore firmo.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThen, AEneas, there is need of courage, of a firm heart.\u201d\n      --AEneid, vi. 261.]\n\nI still insisted upon the truce, too willing they should have the gain of\nwhat they had already taken from me, which was not to be despised,\nwithout promise of any other ransom.  After two or three hours that we\nhad been in this place, and that they had mounted me upon a horse that\nwas not likely to run from them, and committed me to the guard of fifteen\nor twenty harquebusiers, and dispersed my servants to others, having\ngiven order that they should carry us away prisoners several ways, and I\nbeing already got some two or three musket-shots from the place,\n\n          \u201cJam prece Pollucis, jam Castoris, implorata,\u201d\n\n          [\u201cBy a prayer addressed now to Pollux, now to Castor.\u201d\n           --Catullus, lxvi. 65.]\n\nbehold a sudden and unexpected alteration; I saw the chief return to me\nwith gentler language, making search amongst the troopers for my\nscattered property, and causing as much as could be recovered to be\nrestored to me, even to my money-box; but the best present they made was\nmy liberty, for the rest did not much concern me at that time.  The true\ncause of so sudden a change, and of this reconsideration, without any\napparent impulse, and of so miraculous a repentance, in such a time, in a\nplanned and deliberate enterprise, and become just by usage (for, at the\nfirst dash, I plainly confessed to them of what party I was, and whither\nI was going), truly, I do not yet rightly understand.  The most prominent\namongst them, who pulled off his vizor and told me his name, repeatedly\ntold me at the time, over and over again, that I owed my deliverance to\nmy countenance, and the liberty and boldness of my speech, that rendered\nme unworthy of such a misadventure, and should secure me from its\nrepetition.  \u2018Tis possible that the Divine goodness willed to make use of\nthis vain instrument for my preservation; and it, moreover, defended me\nthe next day from other and worse ambushes, of which these my assailants\nhad given me warning.  The last of these two gentlemen is yet living\nhimself to tell the story; the first was killed not long ago.\n\nIf my face did not answer for me, if men did not read in my eyes and in\nmy voice the innocence of intention, I had not lived so long without\nquarrels and without giving offence, seeing the indiscreet whatever comes\ninto my head, and to judge so rashly of things.  This way may, with\nreason, appear uncivil, and ill adapted to our way of conversation; but\nI have never met with any who judged it outrageous or malicious, or that\ntook offence at my liberty, if he had it from my own mouth; words\nrepeated have another kind of sound and sense.  Nor do I hate any person;\nand I am so slow to offend, that I cannot do it, even upon the account of\nreason itself; and when occasion has required me to sentence criminals,\nI have rather chosen to fail in point of justice than to do it:\n\n               \u201cUt magis peccari nolim, quam satis animi\n               ad vindicanda peccata habeam.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cSo that I had rather men should not commit faults than that I\n     should have sufficient courage to condemn them.\u201d---Livy, xxxix. 21.]\n\nAristotle, \u2018tis said, was reproached for having been too merciful to a\nwicked man: \u201cI was indeed,\u201d said he, \u201cmerciful to the man, but not to his\nwickedness.\u201d  Ordinary judgments exasperate themselves to punishment by\nthe horror of the fact: but it cools mine; the horror of the first murder\nmakes me fear a second; and the deformity of the first cruelty makes me\nabhor all imitation of it.\u2019 That may be applied to me, who am but a\nSquire of Clubs, which was said of Charillus, king of Sparta: \u201cHe cannot\nbe good, seeing he is not evil even to the wicked.\u201d  Or thus--for\nPlutarch delivers it both these ways, as he does a thousand other things,\nvariously and contradictorily--\u201cHe must needs be good, because he is so\neven to the wicked.\u201d  Even as in lawful actions I dislike to employ\nmyself when for such as are displeased at it;

Of Experience.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nOF EXPERIENCE\n\nThere is no desire more natural than that of knowledge.  We try all ways\nthat can lead us to it; where reason is wanting, we therein employ\nexperience,\n\n              \u201cPer varios usus artem experientia fecit,\n               Exemplo monstrante viam,\u201d\n\n     [\u201cBy various trials experience created art, example shewing the\n     way.\u201d--Manilius, i. 59.]\n\nwhich is a means much more weak and cheap; but truth is so great a thing\nthat we ought not to disdain any mediation that will guide us to it.\nReason has so many forms that we know not to which to take; experience\nhas no fewer; the consequence we would draw from the comparison of events\nis unsure, by reason they are always unlike.  There is no quality so\nuniversal in this image of things as diversity and variety.  Both the\nGreeks and the Latins and we, for the most express example of similitude,\nemploy that of eggs; and yet there have been men, particularly one at\nDelphos, who could distinguish marks of difference amongst eggs so well\nthat he never mistook one for another, and having many hens, could tell\nwhich had laid it.\n\nDissimilitude intrudes itself of itself in our works; no art can arrive\nat perfect similitude: neither Perrozet nor any other can so carefully\npolish and blanch the backs of his cards that some gamesters will not\ndistinguish them by seeing them only shuffled by another.  Resemblance\ndoes not so much make one as difference makes another.  Nature has\nobliged herself to make nothing other that was not unlike.\n\nAnd yet I am not much pleased with his opinion, who thought by the\nmultitude of laws to curb the authority of judges in cutting out for them\ntheir several parcels; he was not aware that there is as much liberty and\nlatitude in the interpretation of laws as in their form; and they but\nfool themselves, who think to lessen and stop our disputes by recalling\nus to the express words of the Bible: forasmuch as our mind does not find\nthe field less spacious wherein to controvert the sense of another than\nto deliver his own; and as if there were less animosity and tartness in\ncommentary than in invention.  We see how much he was mistaken, for we\nhave more laws in France than all the rest of the world put together, and\nmore than would be necessary for the government of all the worlds of\nEpicurus:\n\n          \u201cUt olim flagitiis, sic nunc legibus, laboramus.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cAs we were formerly by crimes, so we are now overburdened by\n     laws.\u201d--Tacitus, Annal., iii. 25.]\n\nand yet we have left so much to the opinions and decisions of our judges\nthat there never was so full a liberty or so full a license.  What have\nour legislators gained by culling out a hundred thousand particular\ncases, and by applying to these a hundred thousand laws?  This number\nholds no manner of proportion with the infinite diversity of human\nactions; the multiplication of our inventions will never arrive at the\nvariety of examples; add to these a hundred times as many more, it will\nstill not happen that, of events to come, there shall one be found that,\nin this vast number of millions of events so chosen and recorded, shall\nso tally with any other one, and be so exactly coupled and matched with\nit that there will not remain some circumstance and diversity which will\nrequire a diverse judgment.  There is little relation betwixt our\nactions, which are in perpetual mutation, and fixed and immutable laws;\nthe most to be desired are those that are the most rare, the most simple\nand general; and I am even of opinion that we had better have none at all\nthan to have them in so prodigious a number as we have.\n\nNature always gives them better and happier than those we make ourselves;\nwitness the picture of the Golden Age of the Poets and the state wherein\nwe see nations live who have no other.  Some there are, who for their\nonly judge take the first passer-by that travels along their mountains,\nto determine their cause; and others who, on their market day, choose out\nsome one amongst them upon the spot to decide their controversies.  What\ndanger would there be that the wisest amongst us should so determine\nours, according to occurrences and at sight, without obligation of\nexample and consequence?  For every foot its own shoe.  King Ferdinand,\nsending colonies to the Indies, wisely provided that they should not\ncarry along with them any students of jurisprudence, for fear lest suits\nshould get footing in that new world, as being a science in its own\nnature, breeder of altercation and division; judging with Plato, \u201cthat\nlawyers and physicians are bad institutions of a country.\u201d\n\nWhence does it come to pass that our common language, so easy for all\nother uses, becomes obscure and unintelligible in wills and contracts?\nand that he who so clearly expresses himself in whatever else he speaks\nor writes, cannot find in these any way of declaring himself that does\nnot fall into doubt and contradiction? if it be not that the princes of\nthat art, applying themselves with a peculiar attention to cull out\nportentous words and to contrive artificial sentences, have so weighed\nevery syllable, and so thoroughly sifted every sort of quirking\nconnection that they are now confounded and entangled in the infinity of\nfigures and minute divisions, and can no more fall within any rule or\nprescription, nor any certain intelligence:\n\n          \u201cConfusum est, quidquid usque in pulverem sectum est.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cWhatever is beaten into powder is undistinguishable (confused).\u201d\n      --Seneca, Ep., 89.]\n\nAs you see children trying to bring a mass of quicksilver to a certain\nnumber of parts, the more they press and work it and endeavour to reduce\nit to their own will, the more they irritate the liberty of this generous\nmetal; it evades their endeavour and sprinkles itself into so many\nseparate bodies as frustrate all reckoning; so is it here, for in\nsubdividing these subtilties we teach men to increase their doubts; they\nput us into a way of extending and diversifying difficulties, and\nlengthen and disperse them.  In sowing and retailing questions they make\nthe world fructify and increase in uncertainties and disputes, as the\nearth is made fertile by being crumbled and dug deep.\n\n                    \u201cDifficultatem facit doctrina.\u201d\n\n               [\u201cLearning (Doctrine) begets difficulty.\u201d\n                --Quintilian, Insat. Orat., x. 3.]\n\nWe doubted of Ulpian, and are still now more perplexed with Bartolus and\nBaldus.  We should efface the trace of this innumerable diversity of\nopinions; not adorn ourselves with it, and fill posterity with crotchets.\nI know not what to say to it; but experience makes it manifest, that so\nmany interpretations dissipate truth and break it.  Aristotle wrote to be\nunderstood; if he could not do this, much less will another that is not\nso good at it; and a third than he, who expressed his own thoughts.  We\nopen the matter, and spill it in pouring out: of one subject we make a\nthousand, and in multiplying and subdividing them, fall again into the\ninfinity of atoms of Epicurus.  Never did two men make the same judgment\nof the same thing; and \u2018tis impossible to find two opinions exactly\nalike, not only in several men, but in the same man, at diverse hours.\nI often find matter of doubt in things of which the commentary has\ndisdained to take notice; I am most apt to stumble in an even country,\nlike some horses that I have known, that make most trips in the smoothest\nway.\n\nWho will not say that glosses augment doubts and ignorance, since there\u2019s\nno book to be found, either human or divine, which the world busies\nitself about, whereof the difficulties are cleared by interpretation.\nThe hundredth commentator passes it on to the next, still more knotty and\nperplexed than he found it.  When were we ever agreed amongst ourselves:\n\u201cThis book has enough; there is now no more to be said about it\u201d?  This\nis most apparent in the law; we give the authority of law to infinite\ndoctors, infinite decrees, and as many interpretations; yet do we find\nany end of the need of interpretating?  is there, for all that, any\nprogress or advancement towards peace, or do we stand in need of any\nfewer advocates and judges than when this great mass of law was yet in\nits first infancy?  On the contrary, we darken and bury intelligence; we\ncan no longer discover it, but at the mercy of so many fences and\nbarriers.  Men do not know the natural disease of the mind; it does\nnothing but ferret and inquire, and is eternally wheeling, juggling, and\nperplexing itself like silkworms, and then suffocates itself in its work;\n\u201cMus in pice.\u201d--[\u201cA mouse in a pitch barrel.\u201d]--It thinks it discovers\nat a great distance, I know not what glimpses of light and imaginary\ntruth: but whilst running to it, so many difficulties, hindrances, and\nnew inquisitions cross it, that it loses its way, and is made drunk with\nthe motion: not much unlike AEsop\u2019s dogs, that seeing something like a\ndead body floating in the sea, and not being able to approach it, set to\nwork to drink the water and lay the passage dry, and so choked\nthemselves.  To which what one Crates\u2019 said of the writings of Heraclitus\nfalls pat enough, \u201cthat they required a reader who could swim well,\u201d so\nthat the depth and weight of his learning might not overwhelm and stifle\nhim.  \u2018Tis nothing but particular weakness that makes us content with\nwhat others or ourselves have found out in this chase after knowledge:\none of better understanding will not rest so content; there is always\nroom for one to follow, nay, even for ourselves; and another road; there\nis no end of our inquisitions; our end is in the other world.  \u2018Tis a\nsign either that the mind has grown shortsighted when it is satisfied, or\nthat it has got weary.  No generous mind can stop in itself; it will\nstill tend further and beyond its power; it has sallies beyond its\neffects; if it do not advance and press forward, and retire, and rush and\nwheel about, \u2018tis but half alive; its pursuits are without bound or\nmethod; its aliment is admiration, the chase, ambiguity, which Apollo\nsufficiently declared in always speaking to us in a double, obscure, and\noblique sense: not feeding, but amusing and puzzling us.  \u2018Tis an\nirregular and perpetual motion, without model and without aim; its\ninventions heat, pursue, and interproduce one another:\n\nEstienne de la Boetie; thus translated by Cotton:\n\n         \u201cSo in a running stream one wave we see\n          After another roll incessantly,\n          And as they glide, each does successively\n          Pursue the other, each the other fly\n          By this that\u2019s evermore pushed on, and this\n          By that continually preceded is:\n          The water still does into water swill,\n          Still the same brook, but different water still.\u201d\n\nThere is more ado to interpret interpretations than to interpret things,\nand more books upon books than upon any other subject; we do nothing but\ncomment upon one another.  Every place swarms with commentaries; of\nauthors there is great scarcity.  Is it not the principal and most\nreputed knowledge of our later ages to understand the learned?  Is it not\nthe common and final end of all studies?  Our opinions are grafted upon\none another; the first serves as a stock to the second, the second to the\nthird, and so forth; thus step by step we climb the ladder; whence it\ncomes to pass that he who is mounted highest has often more honour than\nmerit, for he is got up but an inch upon the shoulders of the last, but\none.\n\nHow often, and, peradventure, how foolishly, have I extended my book to\nmake it speak of itself; foolishly, if for no other reason but this, that\nit should remind me of what I say of others who do the same: that the\nfrequent amorous glances they cast upon their work witness that their\nhearts pant with self-love, and that even the disdainful severity\nwherewith they scourge them are but the dandlings and caressings of\nmaternal love; as Aristotle, whose valuing and undervaluing himself often\nspring from the same air of arrogance.  My own excuse is, that I ought in\nthis to have more liberty than others, forasmuch as I write specifically\nof myself and of my writings, as I do of my other actions; that my theme\nturns upon itself; but I know not whether others will accept this excuse.\n\nI observed in Germany that Luther has left as many divisions and disputes\nabout the doubt of his opinions, and more, than he himself raised upon\nthe Holy Scriptures.  Our contest is verbal: I ask what nature is, what\npleasure, circle, and substitution are?  the question is about words, and\nis answered accordingly.  A stone is a body; but if a man should further\nurge: \u201cAnd what is a body?\u201d--\u201cSubstance\u201d; \u201cAnd what is substance?\u201d  and\nso on, he would drive the respondent to the end of his Calepin.\n\n     [Calepin (Ambrogio da Calepio), a famous lexicographer of the\n     fifteenth century.  His Polyglot Dictionary became so famous, that\n     Calepin became a common appellation for a lexicon]\n\nWe exchange one word for another, and often for one less understood.\nI better know what man is than I know what Animal is, or Mortal, or\nRational.  To satisfy one doubt, they give me three; \u2018tis the Hydra\u2019s\nhead.  Socrates asked Menon, \u201cWhat virtue was.\u201d  \u201cThere is,\u201d says Menon,\n\u201cthe virtue of a man and of a woman, of a magistrate and of a private\nperson, of an old man and of a child.\u201d  \u201cVery fine,\u201d cried Socrates,\n\u201cwe were in quest of one virtue, and thou hast  brought us a whole\nswarm.\u201d  We put one question, and they return us a whole hive.  As no\nevent, no face, entirely resembles another, so do they not entirely\ndiffer: an ingenious mixture of nature.  If our faces were not alike, we\ncould not distinguish man from beast; if they were not unlike, we could\nnot distinguish one man from another; all things hold by some similitude;\nevery example halts, and the relation which is drawn from experience is\nalways faulty and imperfect.  Comparisons are ever-coupled at one end or\nother: so do the laws serve, and are fitted to every one of our affairs,\nby some wrested, biassed, and forced interpretation.\n\nSince the ethic laws, that concern the particular duty of every one in\nhimself, are so hard to be framed, as we see they are, \u2018tis no wonder if\nthose which govern so many particulars are much more so.  Do but consider\nthe form of this justice that governs us; \u2018tis a true testimony of human\nweakness, so full is it of error and contradiction.  What we find to be\nfavour and severity in justice--and we find so much of them both, that I\nknow not whether the medium is as often met with are sickly and unjust\nmembers of the very body and essence of justice.  Some country people\nhave just brought me news in great haste, that they presently left in a\nforest of mine a man with a hundred wounds upon him, who was yet\nbreathing, and begged of them water for pity\u2019s sake, and help to carry\nhim to some place of relief; they tell me they durst not go near him, but\nhave run away, lest the officers of justice should catch them there; and\nas happens to those who are found near a murdered person, they should be\ncalled in question about this accident, to their utter ruin, having\nneither money nor friends to defend their innocence.  What could I have\nsaid to these people?  \u2018Tis certain that this office of humanity would\nhave brought them into trouble.\n\nHow many innocent people have we known that have been punished, and this\nwithout the judge\u2019s fault; and how many that have not arrived at our\nknowledge?  This happened in my time: certain men were condemned to die\nfor a murder committed; their sentence, if not pronounced, at least\ndetermined and concluded on.  The judges, just in the nick, are informed\nby the officers of an inferior court hard by, that they have some men in\ncustody, who have directly confessed the murder, and made an indubitable\ndiscovery of all the particulars of the fact.  Yet it was gravely\ndeliberated whether or not they ought to suspend the execution of the\nsentence already passed upon the first accused: they considered the\nnovelty of the example judicially, and the consequence of reversing\njudgments; that the sentence was passed, and the judges deprived of\nrepentance; and in the result, these poor devils were sacrificed by the\nforms of justice.  Philip, or some other,  provided against a like\ninconvenience after this manner.  He had condemned a man in a great fine\ntowards another by an absolute judgment.  The truth some time after being\ndiscovered, he found that he had passed an unjust sentence.  On one side\nwas the reason of the cause; on the other side, the reason of the\njudicial forms: he in some sort satisfied both, leaving the sentence in\nthe state it was, and out of his own purse recompensing the condemned\nparty.  But he had to do with a reparable affair; my men were irreparably\nhanged.  How many condemnations have I seen more criminal than the crimes\nthemselves?\n\nAll which makes me remember the ancient opinions, \u201cThat \u2018tis of necessity\na man must do wrong by retail who will do right in gross; and injustice\nin little things, who would come to do justice in great: that human\njustice is formed after the model of physic, according to which, all that\nis useful is also just and honest: and of what is held by the Stoics,\nthat Nature herself proceeds contrary to justice in most of her works:\nand of what is received by the Cyrenaics, that there is nothing just of\nitself, but that customs and laws make justice: and what the Theodorians\nheld that theft, sacrilege, and all sorts of uncleanness, are just in a\nsage, if he knows them to be profitable to him.\u201d  There is no remedy: I\nam in the same case that Alcibiades was, that I will never, if I can help\nit, put myself into the hands of a man who may determine as to my head,\nwhere my life and honour shall more depend upon the skill and diligence\nof my attorney than on my own innocence.  I would venture myself with\nsuch justice as would take notice of my good deeds, as well as my ill;\nwhere I had as much to hope as to fear: indemnity is not sufficient pay\nto a man who does better than not to do amiss.  Our justice presents to\nus but one hand, and that the left hand, too; let him be who he may, he\nshall be sure to come off with loss.\n\nIn China, of which kingdom the government and arts, without commerce with\nor knowledge of ours, surpass our examples in several excellent features,\nand of which the history teaches me how much greater and more various the\nworld is than either the ancients or we have been able to penetrate, the\nofficers deputed by the prince to visit the state of his provinces, as\nthey punish those who behave themselves ill in their charge, so do they\nliberally reward those who have conducted themselves better than the\ncommon sort, and beyond the necessity of their duty; these there present\nthemselves, not only to be approved but to get; not simply to be paid,\nbut to have a present made to them.\n\nNo judge, thank God, has ever yet spoken to me in the quality of a judge,\nupon any account whatever, whether my own or that of a third party,\nwhether criminal or civil; nor no prison has ever received me, not even\nto walk there.  Imagination renders the very outside of a jail\ndispleasing to me; I am so enamoured of liberty, that should I be\ninterdicted the access to some corner of the Indies, I should live a\nlittle less at my ease; and whilst I can find earth or air open\nelsewhere, I shall never lurk in any place where I must hide myself.\nMy God!  how ill should I endure the condition wherein I see so many\npeople, nailed to a corner of the kingdom, deprived of the right to enter\nthe principal cities and courts, and the liberty of the public roads,\nfor having quarrelled with our laws.  If those under which I live should\nshake a finger at me by way of menace, I would immediately go seek out\nothers, let them be where they would.  All my little prudence in the\ncivil wars wherein we are now engaged is employed that they may not\nhinder my liberty of going and coming.\n\nNow, the laws keep up their credit, not for being just, but because they\nare laws; \u2018tis the mystic foundation of their authority; they have no\nother, and it well answers their purpose.  They are often made by fools,\nstill oftener by men who, out of hatred to equality, fail in equity, but\nalways by men, vain and irresolute authors.  There is nothing so much,\nnor so grossly, nor so ordinarily faulty, as the laws.  Whoever obeys\nthem because they are just, does not justly obey them as he ought.  Our\nFrench laws, by their irregularity and deformity, lend, in some sort, a\nhelping hand to the disorder and corruption that all manifest in their\ndispensation and execution: the command is so perplexed and inconstant,\nthat it in some sort excuses alike disobedience and defect in the\ninterpretation, the administration and the observation of it.  What fruit\nthen soever we may extract from experience, that will little advantage\nour institution, which we draw from foreign examples, if we make so\nlittle profit of that we have of our own, which is more familiar to us,\nand, doubtless, sufficient to instruct us in that whereof we have need.\nI study myself more than any other subject; \u2018tis my metaphysic, my\nphysic:\n\n              \u201cQuis deus hanc mundi temperet arte domum:\n               Qua venit exoriens, qua deficit: unde coactis\n               Cornibus in plenum menstrua luna redit\n               Unde salo superant venti, quid flamine captet\n               Eurus, et in nubes unde perennis aqua;\n               Sit ventura dies mundi quae subruat arces....\u201d\n\n\n     [\u201cWhat god may govern with skill this dwelling of the world?  whence\n     rises the monthly moon, whither wanes she?  how is it that her horns\n     are contracted and reopen?  whence do winds prevail on the main?\n     what does the east wind court with its blasts?  and whence are the\n     clouds perpetually supplied with water?  is a day to come which may\n     undermine the world?\u201d--Propertius, iii. 5, 26.]\n\n               \u201cQuaerite, quos agitat mundi labor.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cAsk whom the cares of the world trouble\u201d--Lucan, i. 417.]\n\nIn this universality, I suffer myself to be ignorantly and negligently\nled by the general law of the world: I shall know it well enough when I\nfeel it; my learning cannot make it alter its course; it will not change\nitself for me; \u2018tis folly to hope it, and a greater folly to concern\none\u2019s self about it, seeing it is necessarily alike public and common.\nThe goodness and capacity of the governor ought absolutely to discharge\nus of all care of the government: philosophical inquisitions and\ncontemplations serve for no other use but to increase our curiosity.\nThe philosophers; with great reason, send us back to the rules of nature;\nbut they have nothing to do with so sublime a knowledge; they falsify\nthem, and present us her face painted with too high and too adulterate a\ncomplexion, whence spring so many different pictures of so uniform a\nsubject.  As she has given us feet to walk with, so has she given us\nprudence to guide us in life: not so ingenious, robust, and pompous a\nprudence as that of their invention; but yet one that is easy, quiet, and\nsalutary, and that very well performs what the other promises, in him who\nhas the good luck to know how to employ it sincerely and regularly, that\nis to say, according to nature.  The most simply to commit one\u2019s self to\nnature is to do it most wisely.  Oh, what a soft, easy, and wholesome\npillow is ignorance and incuriosity, whereon to repose a well-ordered\nhead!\n\nI had rather understand myself well in myself, than in Cicero.  Of the\nexperience I have of myself, I find enough to make me wise, if I were but\na good scholar: whoever will call to mind the excess of his past anger,\nand to what a degree that fever transported him, will see the deformity\nof this passion better than in Aristotle, and conceive a more just hatred\nagainst it; whoever will remember the ills he has undergone, those that\nhave threatened him, and the light occasions that have removed him from\none state to another, will by that prepare himself for future changes,\nand the knowledge of his condition.  The life of Caesar has no greater\nexample for us than our own: though popular and of command, \u2018tis still a\nlife subject to all human accidents.  Let us but listen to it; we apply\nto ourselves all whereof we have principal need; whoever shall call to\nmemory how many and many times he has been mistaken in his own judgment,\nis he not a great fool if he does not ever after suspect it?  When I find\nmyself convinced, by the reason of another, of a false opinion, I do not\nso much learn what he has said to me that is new and the particular\nignorance--that would be no great acquisition--as, in general, I learn my\nown debility and the treachery of my understanding, whence I extract the\nreformation of the whole mass.  In all my other errors I do the same, and\nfind from this rule great utility to life; I regard not the species and\nindividual as a stone that I have stumbled at; I learn to suspect my\nsteps throughout, and am careful to place them right.  To learn that a\nman has said or done a foolish thing is nothing: a man must learn that he\nis nothing but a fool, a much more ample, and important instruction.  The\nfalse steps that my memory has so often made, even then when it was most\nsecure and confident of itself, are not idly thrown away; it vainly\nswears and assures me I shake my ears; the first opposition that is made\nto its testimony puts me into suspense, and I durst not rely upon it in\nanything of moment, nor warrant it in another person\u2019s concerns: and were\nit not that what I do for want of memory, others do more often for want\nof good faith, I should always, in matter of fact, rather choose to take\nthe truth from another\u2019s mouth than from my own.  If every one would pry\ninto the effects and circumstances of the passions that sway him, as I\nhave done into those which I am most subject to, he would see them\ncoming, and would a little break their impetuosity and career; they do\nnot always seize us on a sudden; there is threatening and degrees\n\n              \u201cFluctus uti primo coepit cum albescere vento,\n               Paulatim sese tollit mare, et altius undas\n               Erigit, inde imo consurgit ad aethera fundo.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cAs with the first wind the sea begins to foam, and swells, thence\n     higher swells, and higher raises the waves, till the ocean rises\n     from its depths to the sky.\u201d--AEneid, vii. 528.]\n\nJudgment holds in me a magisterial seat; at least it carefully endeavours\nto make it so: it leaves my appetites to take their own course, hatred\nand friendship, nay, even that I bear to myself, without change or\ncorruption; if it cannot reform the other parts according to its own\nmodel, at least it suffers not itself to be corrupted by them, but plays\nits game apart.\n\nThe advice to every one, \u201cto know themselves,\u201d should be of important\neffect, since that god of wisdom and light\u2019 caused it to be written on\nthe front of his temple,--[At Delphi]--as comprehending all he had to\nadvise us.  Plato says also, that prudence is no other thing than the\nexecution of this ordinance; and Socrates minutely verifies it in\nXenophon.  The difficulties and obscurity are not discerned in any\nscience but by those who are got into it; for a certain degree of\nintelligence is required to be able to know that a man knows not, and we\nmust push against a door to know whether it be bolted against us or no:\nwhence this Platonic subtlety springs, that \u201cneither they who know are to\nenquire, forasmuch as they know; nor they who do not know, forasmuch as\nto inquire they must know what they inquire of.\u201d  So in this, \u201cof knowing\na man\u2019s self,\u201d that every man is seen so resolved and satisfied with\nhimself, that every man thinks himself sufficiently intelligent,\nsignifies that every one knows nothing about the matter; as Socrates\ngives Euthydemus to understand.  I, who profess nothing else, therein\nfind so infinite a depth and variety, that all the fruit I have reaped\nfrom my learning serves only to make me sensible how much I have to\nlearn.  To my weakness, so often confessed, I owe the propension I have\nto modesty, to the obedience of belief prescribed me, to a constant\ncoldness and moderation of opinions, and a hatred of that troublesome and\nwrangling arrogance, wholly believing and trusting in itself, the capital\nenemy of discipline and truth.  Do but hear them domineer; the first\nfopperies they utter, \u2018tis in the style wherewith men establish religions\nand laws:\n\n          \u201cNihil est turpius, quam cognitioni et perceptions\n          assertionem approbationemque praecurrere.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cNothing is worse than that assertion and decision should precede\n     knowledge and perception.\u201d--Cicero, Acad., i. 13.]\n\nAristarchus said that anciently there were scarce seven sages to be found\nin the world, and in his time scarce so many fools: have not we more\nreason than he to say so in this age of ours?  Affirmation and obstinacy\nare express signs of want of wit.  This fellow may have knocked his nose\nagainst the ground a hundred times in a day, yet he will be at his Ergo\u2019s\nas resolute and sturdy as before.  You would say he had had some new soul\nand vigour of understanding infused into him since, and that it happened\nto him, as to that ancient son of the earth, who took fresh courage and\nvigour by his fall;\n\n                      \u201cCui cum tetigere parentem,\n            jam defecta vigent renovata robore membra:\u201d\n\n     [\u201cWhose broken limbs, when they touched his mother earth,\n     immediately new force acquired.\u201d--Lucan, iv. 599.]\n\ndoes not this incorrigible coxcomb think that he assumes a new\nunderstanding by undertaking a new dispute?  \u2018Tis by my own experience\nthat I accuse human ignorance, which is, in my opinion, the surest part\nof the world\u2019s school.  Such as will not conclude it in themselves, by so\nvain an example as mine, or their own, let them believe it from Socrates,\nthe master of masters; for the philosopher Antisthenes said to his\ndisciples, \u201cLet us go and hear Socrates; there I will be a pupil with you\u201d;\nand, maintaining this doctrine of the Stoic sect, \u201cthat virtue was\nsufficient to make a life completely happy, having no need of any other\nthing whatever\u201d; except of the force of Socrates, added he.\n\nThat long attention that I employ in considering myself, also fits rile\nto judge tolerably enough of others; and there are few things whereof I\nspeak better and with better excuse.  I happen very often more exactly to\nsee and distinguish the qualities of my friends than they do themselves:\nI have astonished some with the pertinence of my description, and have\ngiven them warning of themselves.  By having from my infancy been\naccustomed to contemplate my own life in those of others, I have acquired\na complexion studious in that particular; and when I am once interit upon\nit, I let few things about me, whether countenances, humours,\nor discourses, that serve to that purpose, escape me.  I study all,\nboth what I am to avoid and what I am to follow.  Also in my friends,\nI discover by their productions their inward inclinations; not by\narranging this infinite variety of so diverse and unconnected actions\ninto certain species and chapters, and distinctly distributing my parcels\nand divisions under known heads and classes;\n\n          \u201cSed neque quam multae species, nec nomina quae sint,\n          Est numerus.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cBut neither can we enumerate how many kinds there what are their\n     names.\u201d--Virgil, Georg., ii. 103.]\n\nThe wise speak and deliver their fancies more specifically, and piece by\npiece; I, who see no further into things than as use informs me, present\nmine generally without rule and experimentally: I pronounce my opinion by\ndisjointed articles, as a thing that cannot be spoken at once and in\ngross; relation and conformity are not to be found in such low and common\nsouls as ours.  Wisdom is a solid and entire building, of which every\npiece keeps its place and bears its mark:\n\n               \u201cSola sapientia in se tota conversa est.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cWisdom only is wholly within itself\u201d--Cicero, De Fin., iii. 7.]\n\nI leave it to artists, and I know not whether or no they will be able to\nbring it about, in so perplexed, minute, and fortuitous a thing, to\nmarshal into distinct bodies this infinite diversity of faces, to settle\nour inconstancy, and set it in order.  I do not only find it hard to\npiece our actions to one another, but I moreover find it hard properly to\ndesign each by itself by any principal quality, so ambiguous and variform\nthey are with diverse lights.  That which is remarked for rare in\nPerseus, king of Macedon, \u201cthat his mind, fixing itself to no one\ncondition, wandered in all sorts of living, and represented manners so\nwild and erratic that it was neither known to himself or any other what\nkind of man he was,\u201d seems almost to fit all the world; and, especially,\nI have seen another of his make, to whom I think this conclusion might\nmore properly be applied; no moderate settledness, still running headlong\nfrom one extreme to another, upon occasions not to be guessed at; no line\nof path without traverse and wonderful contrariety: no one quality simple\nand unmixed; so that the best guess men can one day make will be, that he\naffected and studied to make himself known by being not to be known.  A\nman had need have sound ears to hear himself frankly criticised; and as\nthere are few who can endure to hear it without being nettled, those who\nhazard the undertaking it to us manifest a singular effect of friendship;\nfor \u2018tis to love sincerely indeed, to venture to wound and offend us, for\nour own good.  I think it harsh to judge a man whose ill qualities are\nmore than his good ones: Plato requires three things in him who will\nexamine the soul of another: knowledge, benevolence, boldness.\n\nI was sometimes asked, what I should have thought myself fit for, had any\none designed to make use of me, while I was of suitable years:\n\n         \u201cDum melior vires sanguis dabat, aemula necdum\n          Temporibus geminis canebat sparsa senectus:\u201d\n\n     [\u201cWhilst better blood gave me vigour, and before envious old age\n     whitened and thinned my temples.\u201d--AEneid, V. 415.]\n\n\u201cfor nothing,\u201d said I; and I willingly excuse myself from knowing\nanything which enslaves me to others.  But I had told the truth to my\nmaster,--[Was this Henri VI.?  D.W.]--and had regulated his manners, if\nhe had so pleased, not in gross, by scholastic lessons, which I\nunderstand not, and from which I see no true reformation spring in those\nthat do; but by observing them by leisure, at all opportunities, and\nsimply and naturally judging them as an eye-witness, distinctly one by\none; giving him to understand upon what terms he was in the common\nopinion, in opposition to his flatterers.  There is none of us who would\nnot be worse than kings, if so continually corrupted as they are with\nthat sort of canaille.  How, if Alexander, that great king and\nphilosopher, cannot defend himself from them!\n\nI should have had fidelity, judgment, and freedom enough for that\npurpose.  It would be a nameless office, otherwise it would lose its\ngrace and its effect; and \u2018tis a part that is not indifferently fit for\nall men; for truth itself has not the privilege to be spoken at all times\nand indiscriminately; its use, noble as it is, has its circumspections\nand limits.  It often falls out, as the world goes, that a man lets it\nslip into the ear of a prince, not only to no purpose, but moreover\ninjuriously and unjustly; and no man shall make me believe that a\nvirtuous remonstrance may not be viciously applied, and that the interest\nof the substance is not often to give way to that of the form.\n\nFor such a purpose, I would  have a man who is content with his own\nfortune:\n\n               \u201cQuod sit, esse velit, nihilque malit,\u201d\n\n          [\u201cWho is pleased with what he is and desires nothing further.\u201d\n           --Martial, x. ii, 18.]\n\nand of moderate station; forasmuch as, on the one hand, he would not be\nafraid to touch his master\u2019s heart to the quick, for fear by that means\nof losing his preferment: and, on the other hand, being of no high\nquality, he would have more easy communication with all sorts of people.\nI would have this office limited to only one person; for to allow the\nprivilege of his liberty and privacy to many, would beget an inconvenient\nirreverence; and of that one, I would above all things require the\nfidelity of silence.\n\nA king is not to be believed when he brags of his constancy in standing\nthe shock of the enemy for his glory, if for his profit and amendment he\ncannot stand the liberty of a friend\u2019s advice, which has no other power\nbut to pinch his ear, the remainder of its effect being still in his own\nhands.  Now, there is no condition of men whatever who stand in so great\nneed of true and free advice and warning, as they do: they sustain a\npublic life, and have to satisfy the opinion of so many spectators, that,\nas those about them conceal from them whatever should divert them from\ntheir own way, they insensibly find themselves involved in the hatred and\ndetestation of their people, often upon occasions which they might have\navoided without any prejudice even of their pleasures themselves, had\nthey been advised and set right in time.  Their favourites commonly have\nmore regard to themselves than to their master; and indeed it answers\nwith them, forasmuch as, in truth, most offices of real friendship, when\napplied to the sovereign, are under a rude and dangerous hazard, so that\ntherein there is great need, not only of very great affection and\nfreedom, but of courage too.\n\nIn fine, all this hodge-podge which I scribble here, is nothing but a\nregister of the essays of my own life, which, for the internal soundness,\nis exemplary enough to take instruction against the grain; but as to\nbodily health, no man can furnish out more profitable experience than I,\nwho present it pure, and no way corrupted and changed by art or opinion.\nExperience is properly upon its own dunghill in the subject of physic,\nwhere reason wholly gives it place: Tiberius said that whoever had lived\ntwenty years ought to be responsible to himself for all things that were\nhurtful or wholesome to him, and know how to order himself without\nphysic;\n\n     [All that Suetonius says in his Life of Tiberius is that this\n     emperor, after he was thirty years old, governed his health without\n     the aid of physicians; and what Plutarch tells us, in his essay on\n     the Rules and Precepts of Health, is that Tiberius said that the man\n     who, having attained sixty years, held out his pulse to a physician\n     was a fool.]\n\nand he might have learned it of Socrates, who, advising his disciples to\nbe solicitous of their health as a chief study, added that it was hard if\na man of sense, having a care to his exercise and diet, did not better\nknow than any physician what was good or ill for him.  And physic itself\nprofesses always to have experience for the test of its operations: so\nPlato had reason to say that, to be a right physician, it would be\nnecessary that he who would become such, should first himself have passed\nthrough all the diseases he pretends to cure, and through all the\naccidents and circumstances whereof he is to judge.  \u2018Tis but reason they\nshould get the pox, if they will know how to cure it; for my part,\nI should put myself into such hands; the others but guide us, like him\nwho paints seas and rocks and ports sitting at table, and there makes the\nmodel of a ship sailing in all security; but put him to the work itself,\nhe knows not at which end to begin.  They make such a description of our\nmaladies as a town crier does of a lost horse or dog--such a color, such\na height, such an ear--but bring it to him and he knows it not, for all\nthat.  If physic should one day give me some good and visible relief,\nthen truly I will cry out in good earnest:\n\n               \u201cTandem effcaci do manus scientiae.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cShow me and efficacious science, and I will take it by the hand.\u201d\n      --Horace, xvii. I.]\n\nThe arts that promise to keep our bodies and souls in health promise a\ngreat deal; but, withal, there are none that less keep their promise.\nAnd, in our time, those who make profession of these arts amongst us,\nless manifest the effects than any other sort of men; one may say of\nthem, at the most, that they sell medicinal drugs; but that they are\nphysicians, a man cannot say.\n\n     [The edition of 1588 adds: \u201cJudging by themselves, and those\n     who are ruled by them.\u201d]\n\nI have lived long enough to be able to give an account of the custom that\nhas carried me so far; for him who has a mind to try it, as his taster,\nI have made the experiment.  Here are some of the articles, as my memory\nshall supply me with them; I have no custom that has not varied according\nto circumstances; but I only record those that I have been best\nacquainted with, and that hitherto have had the greatest possession of\nme.\n\nMy form of life is the same in sickness as in health; the same bed, the\nsame hours, the same meat, and even the same drink, serve me in both\nconditions alike; I add nothing to them but the moderation of more or\nless, according to my strength and appetite.  My health is to maintain my\nwonted state without disturbance.  I see that sickness puts me off it on\none side, and if I will be ruled by the physicians, they will put me off\non the other; so that by fortune and by art I am out of my way.\nI believe nothing more certainly than this, that I cannot be hurt by the\nuse of things to which I have been so long accustomed.  \u2018Tis for custom\nto give a form to a man\u2019s life, such as it pleases him; she is all in all\nin that: \u2018tis the potion of Circe, that varies our nature as she best\npleases.  How many nations, and but three steps from us, think the fear\nof the night-dew, that so manifestly is hurtful to us, a ridiculous\nfancy; and our own watermen and peasants laugh at it.  You make a German\nsick if you lay him upon a mattress, as you do an Italian if you lay him\non a feather-bed, and a Frenchman, if without curtains or fire. A Spanish\nstomach cannot hold out to eat as we can, nor ours to drink like the\nSwiss.  A German made me very merry at Augsburg, by finding fault with\nour hearths, by the same arguments which we commonly make use of in\ndecrying their stoves: for, to say the truth, the smothered heat, and\nthen the smell of that heated matter of which the fire is composed, very\nmuch offend such as are not used to them; not me; and, indeed, the heat\nbeing always equal, constant, and universal, without flame, without\nsmoke, and without the wind that comes down our chimneys, they may many\nways sustain comparison with ours.  Why do we not imitate the Roman\narchitecture? for they say that anciently fires were not made in the\nhouses, but on the outside, and at the foot of them, whence the heat was\nconveyed to the whole fabric by pipes contrived in the wall, which were\ndrawn twining about the rooms that were to be warmed: which I have seen\nplainly described somewhere in Seneca.  This German hearing me commend\nthe conveniences and beauties of his city, which truly deserves it, began\nto compassionate me that I had to leave it; and the first inconvenience\nhe alleged to me was, the heaviness of head that the chimneys elsewhere\nwould bring upon me.  He had heard some one make this complaint, and\nfixed it upon us, being by custom deprived of the means of perceiving it\nat home.  All heat that comes from the fire weakens and dulls me.  Evenus\nsaid that fire was the best condiment of life: I rather choose any other\nway of making myself warm.\n\nWe are afraid to drink our wines, when toward the bottom of the cask; in\nPortugal those fumes are reputed delicious, and it is the beverage of\nprinces.  In short, every nation has many customs and usages that are not\nonly unknown to other nations, but savage and miraculous in their sight.\nWhat should we do with those people who admit of no evidence that is not\nin print, who believe not men if they are not in a book, nor truth if it\nbe not of competent age? we dignify our fopperies when we commit them to\nthe press: \u2018tis of a great deal more weight to say, \u201cI have read such a\nthing,\u201d than if you only say, \u201cI have heard such a thing.\u201d  But I, who no\nmore disbelieve a man\u2019s mouth than his pen, and who know that men write\nas indiscreetly as they speak, and who look upon this age as one that is\npast, as soon quote a friend as Aulus Gelliusor Macrobius; and what I\nhave seen, as what they have written.  And, as \u2018tis held of virtue, that\nit is not greater for having continued longer, so do I hold of truth,\nthat for being older it is none the wiser.  I often say, that it is mere\nfolly that makes us run after foreign and scholastic examples; their\nfertility is the same now that it was in the time of Homer and Plato.\nBut is it not that we seek more honour from the quotation, than from the\ntruth of the matter in hand?  As if it were more to the purpose to borrow\nour proofs from the shops of Vascosan or Plantin, than from what is to be\nseen in our own village; or else, indeed, that we have not the wit to\ncull out and make useful what we see before us, and to judge of it\nclearly enough to draw it into example: for if we say that we want\nauthority to give faith to our testimony, we speak from the purpose;\nforasmuch as, in my opinion, of the most ordinary, common, and known\nthings, could we but find out their light, the greatest miracles of\nnature might be formed, and the most wonderful examples, especially upon\nthe subject of human actions.\n\nNow, upon this subject, setting aside the examples I have gathered from\nbooks, and what Aristotle says of Andron the Argian, that he travelled\nover the arid sands of Lybia without drinking: a gentleman, who has very\nwell behaved himself in several employments, said, in a place where I\nwas, that he had ridden from Madrid to Lisbon, in the heat of summer,\nwithout any drink at all.  He is very healthful and vigorous for his age,\nand has nothing extraordinary in the use of his life, but this, to live\nsometimes two or three months, nay, a whole year, as he has told me,\nwithout drinking.  He is sometimes thirsty, but he lets it pass over,\nand he holds that it is an appetite which easily goes off of itself;\nand he drinks more out of caprice than either for need or pleasure.\n\nHere is another example: \u2018tis not long ago that I found one of the\nlearnedest men in France, among those of not inconsiderable fortune,\nstudying in a corner of a hall that they had separated for him with\ntapestry, and about him a rabble of his servants full of licence.  He\ntold me, and Seneca almost says the same of himself,  he made an\nadvantage of this hubbub; that, beaten with this noise, he so much\nthe more collected and retired himself into himself for contemplation,\nand that this tempest of voices drove back his thoughts within himself.\nBeing a student at Padua, he had his study so long situated amid the\nrattle of coaches and the tumult of the square, that he not only formed\nhimself to the contempt, but even to the use of noise, for the service of\nhis studies.  Socrates answered Alcibiades, who was astonished how he\ncould endure the perpetual scolding of his wife, \u201cWhy,\u201d said he, \u201cas\nthose do who are accustomed to the ordinary noise of wheels drawing\nwater.\u201d  I am quite otherwise; I have a tender head and easily\ndiscomposed; when \u2018tis bent upon anything, the least buzzing of a fly\nmurders it.\n\nSeneca in his youth having warmly espoused the example of Sextius, of\neating nothing that had died, for a whole year dispensed with such food,\nand, as he said, with pleasure, and discontinued it that he might not be\nsuspected of taking up this rule from some new religion by which it was\nprescribed: he adopted, in like manner, from the precepts of Attalus a\ncustom not to lie upon any sort of bedding that gave way under his\nweight, and, even to his old age, made use of such as would not yield to\nany pressure.  What the usage of his time made him account roughness,\nthat of ours makes us look upon as effeminacy.\n\nDo but observe the difference betwixt the way of living of my labourers\nand my own; the Scythians and Indians have nothing more remote both from\nmy capacity and my form.  I have picked up charity  boys to serve me: who\nsoon after have quitted both my kitchen and livery, only that they might\nreturn to their former course of life; and I found one afterwards,\npicking mussels out of the sewer for his dinner, whom I could neither by\nentreaties nor threats reclaim from the sweetness he found in indigence.\nBeggars have their magnificences and delights, as well as the rich, and,\n\u2018tis said, their dignities and polities.  These are the effects of\ncustom; she can mould us, not only into what form she pleases (the sages\nsay we ought to apply ourselves to the best, which she will soon make\neasy to us), but also to change and variation, which is the most noble\nand most useful instruction of all she teaches us.  The best of my bodily\nconditions is that I am flexible and not very obstinate: I have\ninclinations more my own and ordinary, and more agreeable than others;\nbut I am diverted from them with very little ado, and easily slip into a\ncontrary course.  A young man ought to cross his own rules, to awaken his\nvigour and to keep it from growing faint and rusty; and there is no\ncourse of life so weak and sottish as that which is carried on by rule\nand discipline;\n\n         \u201cAd primum lapidem vectari quum placet, hora\n          Sumitur ex libro; si prurit frictus ocelli\n          Angulus, inspecta genesi, collyria quaerit;\u201d\n\n     [\u201cWhen he is pleased to have himself carried to the first milestone,\n     the hour is chosen from the almanac; if he but rub the corner of his\n     eye, his horoscope having been examined, he seeks the aid of\n     salves.\u201d---Juvenal, vi. 576.]\n\nhe shall often throw himself even into excesses, if he will take my\nadvice; otherwise the least debauch will destroy him, and render him\ntroublesome and disagreeable in company.  The worst quality in a\nwell-bred man is over-fastidiousness, and an obligation to a certain\nparticular way; and it is particular, if not pliable and supple.  It is a\nkind of reproach, not to be able, or not to dare, to do what we see those\nabout us do; let such as these stop at home.  It is in every man\nunbecoming, but in a soldier vicious and intolerable: who, as Philopcemen\nsaid, ought to accustom himself to every variety and inequality of life.\n\nThough I have been brought up, as much as was possible, to liberty and\nindependence, yet so it is that, growing old, and having by indifference\nmore settled upon certain forms (my age is now past instruction, and has\nhenceforward nothing to do but to keep itself up as well as it can),\ncustom has already, ere I was aware, so imprinted its character in me in\ncertain things, that I look upon it as a kind of excess to leave them\noff; and, without a force upon myself, cannot sleep in the daytime, nor\neat between meals, nor breakfast, nor go to bed, without a great interval\nbetwixt eating and sleeping,--[Gastroesophogeal Reflux. D.W.]--as of\nthree hours after supper; nor get children but before I sleep, nor get\nthem standing; nor endure my own sweat; nor quench my thirst either with\npure water or pure wine; nor keep my head long bare, nor cut my hair\nafter dinner; and I should be as uneasy without my gloves as without my\nshirt, or without washing when I rise from table or out of my bed; and I\ncould not lie without a canopy and curtains, as if they were essential\nthings.  I could dine without a tablecloth, but without a clean napkin,\nafter the German fashion, very incommodiously; I foul them more than the\nGermans or Italians do, and make but little use either of spoon or fork.\nI complain that they did not keep up the fashion, begun after the example\nof kings, to change our napkin at every service, as they do our plate.\nWe are told of that laborious soldier Marius that, growing old, he became\nnice in his drink, and never drank but out of a particular cup of his own\nI, in like manner, have suffered myself to fancy a certain form of\nglasses, and not willingly to drink in common glasses, no more than from\na strange common hand: all metal offends me in comparison of a clear and\ntransparent matter: let my eyes taste, too, according to their capacity.\nI owe several other such niceties to custom.  Nature has also, on the\nother side, helped me to some of hers: as not to be able to endure more\nthan two full meals in one day, without overcharging my stomach, nor a\ntotal abstinence from one of those meals without filling myself with\nwind, drying up my mouth, and dulling my appetite; the finding great\ninconvenience from overmuch evening air; for of late years, in night\nmarches, which often happen to be all night long, after five or six hours\nmy stomach begins to be queasy, with a violent pain in my head, so that I\nalways vomit before the day can break.  When the others go to breakfast,\nI go to sleep; and when I rise, I am as brisk and gay as before.  I had\nalways been told that the night dew never rises but in the beginning of\nthe night; but for some years past, long and familiar intercourse with\na lord, possessed with the opinion that the night dew is more sharp and\ndangerous about the declining of the sun, an hour or two before it sets,\nwhich he carefully avoids, and despises that of the night, he almost\nimpressed upon me, not so much his reasoning as his experiences.  What,\nshall mere doubt and inquiry strike our imagination, so as to change us?\nSuch as absolutely and on a sudden give way to these propensions, draw\ntotal destruction upon themselves. I am sorry for several gentlemen who,\nthrough the folly of their physicians, have in their youth and health\nwholly shut themselves up: it were better to endure a cough, than, by\ndisuse, for ever to lose the commerce of common life in things of so\ngreat utility.  Malignant science, to interdict us the most pleasant\nhours of the day!  Let us keep our possession to the last; for the most\npart, a man hardens himself by being obstinate, and corrects his\nconstitution, as Caesar did the falling sickness, by dint of contempt.\nA man should addict himself to the best rules, but not enslave himself to\nthem, except to such, if there be any such, where obligation and\nservitude are of profit.\n\nBoth kings and philosophers go to stool, and ladies too; public lives are\nbound to ceremony; mine, that is obscure and private, enjoys all natural\ndispensation; soldier and Gascon are also qualities a little subject to\nindiscretion; wherefore I shall say of this act of relieving nature, that\nit is desirable to refer it to certain prescribed and nocturnal hours,\nand compel one\u2019s self to this by custom, as I have done; but not to\nsubject one\u2019s self, as I have done in my declining years, to a particular\nconvenience of place and seat for that purpose, and make it troublesome\nby long sitting; and yet, in the fouler offices, is it not in some\nmeasure excusable to require more care and cleanliness?\n\n          \u201cNaturt homo mundum et elegans animal est.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cMan is by nature a clean and delicate creature.\u201d--Seneca, Ep., 92.]\n\nOf all the actions of nature, I am the most impatient of being\ninterrupted in that.  I have seen many soldiers troubled with the\nunruliness of their bellies; whereas mine and I never fail of our\npunctual assignation, which is at leaping out of bed, if some\nindispensable business or sickness does not molest us.\n\nI think then, as I said before, that sick men cannot better place\nthemselves anywhere in more safety, than in sitting still in that course\nof life wherein they have been bred and trained up; change, be it what it\nwill, distempers and puts one out.  Do you believe that chestnuts can\nhurt a Perigordin or a Lucchese, or milk and cheese the mountain people?\nWe enjoin them not only a new, but a contrary, method of life; a change\nthat the healthful cannot endure.  Prescribe water to a Breton of\nthreescore and ten; shut a seaman up in a stove; forbid a Basque footman\nto walk: you will deprive them of motion, and in the end of air and\nlight:\n\n              \u201cAn vivere tanti est?\n               Cogimur a suetis animum suspendere rebus,\n               Atque, ut vivamus, vivere desinimus.  .\n               Hos superesse reor, quibus et spirabilis aer\n               Et lux, qua regimur, redditur ipsa gravis.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cIs life worth so much?  We are compelled to withhold the mind\n     from things to which we are accustomed; and, that we may live, we\n     cease to live .  .  .  .  Do I conceive that they still live, to\n     whom the respirable air, and the light itself, by which we are\n     governed, is rendered oppressive?\u201d\n      --Pseudo-Gallus, Eclog., i. 155, 247.]\n\nIf they do no other good, they do this at least, that they prepare\npatients betimes for death, by little and little undermining and cutting\noff the use of life.\n\nBoth well and sick, I have ever willingly suffered myself to obey the\nappetites that pressed upon me.  I give great rein to my desires and\npropensities; I do not love to cure one disease by another; I hate\nremedies that are more troublesome than the disease itself.  To be\nsubject to the colic and subject to abstain from eating oysters are two\nevils instead of one; the disease torments us on the one side, and the\nremedy on the other.  Since we are ever in danger of mistaking, let us\nrather run the hazard of a mistake, after we have had the pleasure.  The\nworld proceeds quite the other way, and thinks nothing profitable that is\nnot painful; it has great suspicion of facility.  My appetite, in various\nthings, has of its own accord happily enough accommodated itself to the\nhealth of my stomach.  Relish and pungency in sauces were pleasant to me\nwhen young; my stomach disliking them since, my taste incontinently\nfollowed.  Wine is hurtful to sick people, and \u2018tis the first thing that\nmy mouth then finds distasteful, and with an invincible dislike.\nWhatever I take against my liking does me harm; and nothing hurts me that\nI eat with appetite and delight.  I never received harm by any action\nthat was very pleasant to me; and accordingly have made all medicinal\nconclusions largely give way to my pleasure; and I have, when I was\nyoung,\n\n         \u201cQuem circumcursans huc atque huc saepe Cupido\n          Fulgebat crocink splendidus in tunic.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cWhen Cupid, fluttering round me here and there, shone in his rich\n     purple mantle.\u201d--Catullus, lxvi. 133.]\n\ngiven myself the rein as licentiously and inconsiderately to the desire\nthat was predominant in me, as any other whomsoever:\n\n                    \u201cEt militavi non sine gloria;\u201d\n\n          [\u201cAnd I have played the soldier not ingloriously.\u201d\n           --Horace, Od., iii.  26, 2.]\n\nyet more in continuation and holding out, than in sally:\n\n               \u201cSex me vix memini sustinuisse vices.\u201d\n\n          [\u201cI can scarcely remember six bouts in one night\u201d\n           --Ovid, Amor., iii. 7, 26.]\n\n\u2018Tis certainly a misfortune and a miracle at once to confess at what a\ntender age I first came under the subjection of love: it was, indeed, by\nchance; for it was long before the years of choice or knowledge; I do not\nremember myself so far back; and my fortune may well be coupled with that\nof Quartilla, who could not remember when she was a maid:\n\n         \u201cInde tragus, celeresque pili, mirandaque matri\n          Barba meae.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThence the odour of the arm-pits, the precocious hair, and the\n     beard which astonished my mother.\u201d--Martial, xi. 22, 7.]\n\nPhysicians modify their rules according to the violent longings that\nhappen to sick persons, ordinarily with good success; this great desire\ncannot be imagined so strange and vicious, but that nature must have a\nhand in it.  And then how easy a thing is it to satisfy the fancy?  In my\nopinion; this part wholly carries it, at least, above all the rest.  The\nmost grievous and ordinary evils are those that fancy loads us with; this\nSpanish saying pleases me in several aspects:\n\n                  \u201cDefenda me Dios de me.\u201d\n\n               [\u201cGod defend me from myself.\u201d]\n\nI am sorry when I am sick, that I have not some longing that might give\nme the pleasure of satisfying it; all the rules of physic would hardly be\nable to divert me from it.  I do the same when I am well; I can see very\nlittle more to be hoped or wished for.  \u2018Twere pity a man should be so\nweak and languishing, as not to have even wishing left to him.\n\nThe art of physic is not so fixed, that we need be without authority for\nwhatever we do; it changes according to climates and moons, according to\nFernel and to Scaliger.--[Physicians to Henry II.]--If your physician\ndoes not think it good for you to sleep, to drink wine, or to eat such\nand such meats, never trouble yourself; I will find you another that\nshall not be of his opinion; the diversity of medical arguments and\nopinions embraces all sorts and forms.  I saw a miserable sick person\npanting and burning for thirst, that he might be cured, who was\nafterwards laughed at for his pains by another physician, who condemned\nthat advice as prejudicial to him: had he not tormented himself to good\npurpose?  There lately died of the stone a man of that profession, who\nhad made use of extreme abstinence to contend with his disease: his\nfellow-physicians say that, on the contrary, this abstinence had dried\nhim up and baked the gravel in his kidneys.\n\nI have observed, that both in wounds and sicknesses, speaking discomposes\nand hurts me, as much as any irregularity I can commit.  My voice pains\nand tires me, for \u2018tis loud and forced; so that when I have gone to a\nwhisper some great persons about affairs of consequence, they have often\ndesired me to moderate my voice.\n\nThis story is worth a diversion.  Some one in a certain Greek school\nspeaking loud as I do, the master of the ceremonies sent to him to speak\nsoftly: \u201cTell him, then, he must send me,\u201d replied the other, \u201cthe tone\nhe would have me speak in.\u201d  To which the other replied, \u201cThat he should\ntake the tone from the ears of him to whom he spake.\u201d  It was well said,\nif it is to be understood: \u201cSpeak according to the affair you are\nspeaking about to your auditor,\u201d for if it mean, \u201c\u2018tis sufficient that he\nhear you, or govern yourself by him,\u201d I do not find it to be reason.  The\ntone and motion of my voice carries with it a great deal of the\nexpression and signification of my meaning, and \u2018tis I who am to govern\nit, to make myself understood: there is a voice to instruct, a voice to\nflatter, and a voice to reprehend.  I will not only that my voice reach\nhim, but, peradventure, that it strike and pierce him.  When I rate my\nvalet with sharp and bitter language, it would be very pretty for him to\nsay; \u201cPray, master, speak lower; I hear you very well\u201d:\n\n               \u201cEst quaedam vox ad auditum accommodata,\n               non magnitudine, sed proprietate.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThere is a certain voice accommodated to the hearing, not by its\n     loudness, but by its propriety.\u201d--Quintilian, xi. 3.]\n\nSpeaking is half his who speaks, and half his who hears; the latter\nought to prepare himself to receive it, according to its bias; as with\ntennis-players, he who receives the ball, shifts and prepares, according\nas he sees him move who strikes the stroke, and according to the stroke\nitself.\n\nExperience has, moreover, taught me this, that we ruin ourselves by\nimpatience.  Evils have their life and limits, their diseases and their\nrecovery.\n\nThe constitution of maladies is formed by the pattern of the constitution\nof animals; they have their fortune and their days limited from their\nbirth; he who attempts imperiously to cut them short by force in the\nmiddle of their course, lengthens and multiplies them, and incenses\ninstead of appeasing them.  I am of Crantor\u2019s opinion, that we are\nneither obstinately and deafly to oppose evils, nor succumb to them from\nwant of courage; but that we are naturally to give way to them, according\nto their condition and our own.  We ought to grant free passage to\ndiseases; I find they stay less with me, who let them alone; and I have\nlost some, reputed the most tenacious and obstinate, by their own decay,\nwithout help and without art, and contrary to its rules.  Let us a little\npermit Nature to take her own way; she better understands her own affairs\nthan we.  But such an one died of it; and so shall you: if not of that\ndisease, of another.  And how many have not escaped dying, who have had\nthree physicians at their tails?  Example is a vague and universal\nmirror, and of various reflections.  If it be a delicious medicine, take\nit: \u2018tis always so much present good.  I will never stick at the name nor\nthe colour, if it be pleasant and grateful to the palate: pleasure is one\nof the chiefest kinds of profit.  I have suffered colds, gouty\ndefluxions, relaxations, palpitations of the heart, megrims, and other\naccidents, to grow old and die in time a natural death.  I have so lost\nthem when I was half fit to keep them: they are sooner prevailed upon by\ncourtesy than huffing.  We must patiently suffer the laws of our\ncondition; we are born to grow old, to grow weak, and to be sick, in\ndespite of all medicine.  \u2018Tis the first lesson the Mexicans teach their\nchildren; so soon as ever they are born they thus salute them: \u201cThou art\ncome into the world, child, to endure: endure, suffer, and say nothing.\u201d\n \u2018Tis injustice to lament that which has befallen any one which may befall\nevery one:\n\n     \u201cIndignare, si quid in to inique proprio constitutum est.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThen be angry, when there is anything unjustly decreed against\n     thee alone.\u201d--Seneca, Ep., 91.]\n\nSee an old man who begs of God that he will maintain his health vigorous\nand entire; that is to say, that he restore him to youth:\n\n          \u201cStulte, quid haec frustra votis puerilibus optas?\u201d\n\n          [\u201cFool!  why do you vainly form these puerile wishes?\u201d\n           --Ovid., Trist., 111. 8, II.]\n\nis it not folly?  his condition is not capable of it.  The gout, the\nstone, and indigestion are symptoms of long years; as heat, rains, and\nwinds are of long journeys.  Plato does not believe that AEsculapius\ntroubled himself to provide by regimen to prolong life in a weak and\nwasted body, useless to his country and to his profession, or to beget\nhealthful and robust children; and does not think this care suitable to\nthe Divine justice and prudence, which is to direct all things to\nutility.  My good friend, your business is done; nobody can restore you;\nthey can, at the most, but patch you up, and prop you a little, and by\nthat means prolong your misery an hour or two:\n\n              \u201cNon secus instantem cupiens fulcire ruinam,\n               Diversis contra nititur obiicibus;\n               Donec certa dies, omni compage soluta,\n               Ipsum cum rebus subruat auxilium.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cLike one who, desiring to stay an impending ruin, places various\n     props against it, till, in a short time, the house, the props, and\n     all, giving way, fall together.\u201d--Pseudo-Gallus, i. 171.]\n\nWe must learn to suffer what we cannot evade; our life, like the harmony\nof the world, is composed of contrary things--of diverse tones, sweet and\nharsh, sharp and flat, sprightly and solemn: the musician who should only\naffect some of these, what would he be able to do?  he must know how to\nmake use of them all, and to mix them; and so we should mingle the goods\nand evils which are consubstantial with our life; our being cannot\nsubsist without this mixture, and the one part is no less necessary to it\nthan the other.  To attempt to combat natural necessity, is to represent\nthe folly of Ctesiphon, who undertook to kick with his mule.--[Plutarch,\nHow to restrain Anger, c. 8.]\n\nI consult little about the alterations I feel: for these doctors take\nadvantage; when they have you at their mercy, they surfeit your ears with\ntheir prognostics; and formerly surprising me, weakened with sickness,\ninjuriously handled me with their dogmas and magisterial fopperies--one\nwhile menacing me with great pains, and another with approaching death.\nHereby I was indeed moved and shaken, but not subdued nor jostled from my\nplace; and though my judgment was neither altered nor distracted, yet it\nwas at least disturbed: \u2018tis always agitation and combat.\n\nNow, I use my imagination as gently as I can, and would discharge it, if\nI could, of all trouble and contest; a man must assist, flatter, and\ndeceive it, if he can; my mind is fit for that office; it needs no\nappearances throughout: could it persuade as it preaches, it would\nsuccessfully relieve me.  Will you have an example?  It tells me: \u201cthat\n\u2018tis for my good to have the stone: that the structure of my age must\nnaturally suffer some decay, and it is now time it should begin to\ndisjoin and to confess a breach; \u2018tis a common necessity, and there is\nnothing in it either miraculous or new; I therein pay what is due to old\nage, and I cannot expect a better bargain; that society ought to comfort\nme, being fallen into the most common infirmity of my age; I see\neverywhere men tormented with the same disease, and am honoured by the\nfellowship, forasmuch as men of the best quality are most frequently\nafflicted with it: \u2018tis a noble and dignified disease: that of such as\nare struck with it, few have it to a less degree of pain; that these are\nput to the trouble of a strict diet and the daily taking of nauseous\npotions, whereas I owe my better state purely to my good fortune; for\nsome ordinary broths of eringo or burst-wort that I have twice or thrice\ntaken to oblige the ladies, who, with greater kindness than my pain was\nsharp, would needs present me half of theirs, seemed to me equally easy\nto take and fruitless in operation, the others have to pay a thousand\nvows to AEsculapius, and as many crowns to their physicians, for the\nvoiding a little gravel, which I often do by the aid of nature: even the\ndecorum of my countenance is not disturbed in company; and I can hold my\nwater ten hours, and as long as any man in health.  The fear of this\ndisease,\u201d says my mind, \u201cformerly affrighted thee, when it was unknown to\nthee; the cries and despairing groans of those who make it worse by their\nimpatience, begot a horror in thee.  \u2018Tis an infirmity that punishes the\nmembers by which thou hast most offended.  Thou art a conscientious\nfellow;\u201d\n\n               \u201cQuae venit indigne poena, dolenda venit:\u201d\n\n     [\u201cWe are entitled to complain of a punishment that we have not\n     deserved.\u201d--Ovid, Heroid., v. 8.]\n\n\u201cconsider this chastisement: \u2018tis very easy in comparison of others, and\ninflicted with a paternal tenderness: do but observe how late it comes;\nit only seizes on and incommodes that part of thy life which is, one way\nand another, sterile and lost; having, as it were by composition, given\ntime for the licence and pleasures of thy youth.  The fear and the\ncompassion that the people have of this disease serve thee for matter of\nglory; a quality whereof if thou bast thy judgment purified, and that thy\nreason has somewhat cured it, thy friends notwithstanding, discern some\ntincture in thy complexion.  \u2018Tis a pleasure to hear it said of oneself\nwhat strength of mind, what patience!  Thou art seen to sweat with pain,\nto turn pale and red, to tremble, to vomit blood, to suffer strange\ncontractions and convulsions, at times to let great tears drop from thine\neyes, to urine thick, black, and dreadful water, or to have it suppressed\nby some sharp and craggy stone, that cruelly pricks and tears the neck of\nthe bladder, whilst all the while thou entertainest the company with an\nordinary countenance; droning by fits with thy people; making one in a\ncontinuous discourse, now and then making excuse for thy pain, and\nrepresenting thy suffering less than it is.  Dost thou call to mind the\nmen of past times, who so greedily sought diseases to keep their virtue\nin breath and exercise?  Put the case that nature sets thee on and impels\nthee to this glorious school, into which thou wouldst never have entered\nof thy own free will.  If thou tellest me that it is a dangerous and\nmortal disease, what others are not so?  for \u2018tis a physical cheat to\nexpect any that they say do not go direct to death: what matters if they\ngo thither by accident, or if they easily slide and slip into the path\nthat leads us to it?  But thou dost not die because thou art sick; thou\ndiest because thou art living: death kills thee without the help of\nsickness: and sickness has deferred death in some, who have lived longer\nby reason that they thought themselves always dying; to which may be\nadded, that as in wounds, so in diseases, some are medicinal and\nwholesome.  The stone is often no less long-lived than you; we see men\nwith whom it has continued from their infancy even to their extreme old\nage; and if they had not broken company, it would have been with them\nlonger still; you more often kill it than it kills you.  And though it\nshould present to you the image of approaching death, were it not a good\noffice to a man of such an age, to put him in mind of his end?  And,\nwhich is worse, thou hast no longer anything that should make thee desire\nto be cured.  Whether or no, common necessity will soon call thee away.\nDo but consider how skilfully and gently she puts thee out of concern\nwith life, and weans thee from the world; not forcing thee with a\ntyrannical subjection, like so many other infirmities which thou seest\nold men afflicted withal, that hold them in continual torment, and keep\nthem in perpetual and unintermitted weakness and pains, but by warnings\nand instructions at intervals, intermixing long pauses of repose, as it\nwere to give thee opportunity to meditate and ruminate upon thy lesson,\nat thy own ease and leisure.  To give thee means to judge aright, and to\nassume the resolution of a man of courage, it presents to thee the state\nof thy entire condition, both in good and evil; and one while a very\ncheerful and another an insupportable life, in one and the same day.  If\nthou embracest not death, at least thou shakest hands with it once a\nmonth; whence thou hast more cause to hope that it will one day surprise\nthee without menace; and that being so often conducted to the water-side,\nbut still thinking thyself to be upon the accustomed terms, thou and thy\nconfidence will at one time or another be unexpectedly wafted over.  A\nman cannot reasonably complain of diseases that fairly divide the time\nwith health.\u201d\n\nI am obliged to Fortune for having so often assaulted me with the same\nsort of weapons: she forms and fashions me by use, hardens and habituates\nme, so that I can know within a little for how much I shall be quit.  For\nwant of natural memory, I make one of paper; and as any new symptom\nhappens in my disease, I set it down, whence it falls out that, having\nnow almost passed through all sorts of examples, if anything striking\nthreatens me, turning over these little loose notes, as the Sybilline\nleaves, I never fail of finding matter of consolation from some\nfavourable prognostic in my past experience.  Custom also makes me hope\nbetter for the time to come; for, the conduct of this clearing out having\nso long continued, \u2018tis to be believed that nature will not alter her\ncourse, and that no other worse accident will happen than what I already\nfeel.  And besides, the condition of this disease is not unsuitable to my\nprompt and sudden complexion: when it assaults me gently, I am afraid,\nfor \u2018tis then for a great while; but it has, naturally, brisk and\nvigorous excesses; it claws me to purpose for a day or two.  My kidneys\nheld out an age without alteration; and I have almost now lived another,\nsince they changed their state; evils have their periods, as well as\nbenefits: peradventure, the infirmity draws towards an end.  Age weakens\nthe heat of my stomach, and, its digestion being less perfect, sends this\ncrude matter to my kidneys; why, at a certain revolution, may not the\nheat of my kidneys be also abated, so that they can no more petrify my\nphlegm, and nature find out some other way of purgation.  Years have\nevidently helped me to drain certain rheums; and why not these excrements\nwhich furnish matter for gravel?  But is there anything delightful in\ncomparison of this sudden change, when from an excessive pain, I come, by\nthe voiding of a stone, to recover, as by a flash of lightning, the\nbeautiful light of health, so free and full, as it happens in our sudden\nand sharpest colics?  Is there anything in the pain suffered, that one\ncan counterpoise to the pleasure of so sudden an amendment?  Oh, how much\ndoes health seem the more pleasant to me, after a sickness so near and so\ncontiguous, that I can distinguish them in the presence of one another,\nin their greatest show; when they appear in emulation, as if to make head\nagainst and dispute it with one another!  As the Stoics say that vices\nare profitably introduced to give value to and to set off virtue, we can,\nwith better reason and less temerity of conjecture, say that nature has\ngiven us pain for the honour and service of pleasure and indolence.  When\nSocrates, after his fetters were knocked off, felt the pleasure of that\nitching which the weight of them had caused in his legs, he rejoiced to\nconsider the strict alliance betwixt pain and pleasure; how they are\nlinked together by a necessary connection, so that by turns they follow\nand mutually beget one another; and cried out to good AEsop, that he\nought out of this consideration to have taken matter for a fine fable.\n\nThe worst that I see in other diseases is, that they are not so grievous\nin their effect as they are in their issue: a man is a whole year in\nrecovering, and all the while full of weakness and fear.  There is so\nmuch hazard, and so many steps to arrive at safety, that there is no end\non\u2019t before they have unmuffled you of a kerchief, and then of a cap,\nbefore they allow you to walk abroad and take the air, to drink wine, to\nlie with your wife, to eat melons, \u2018tis odds you relapse into some new\ndistemper.  The stone has this privilege, that it carries itself clean\noff: whereas the other maladies always leave behind them some impression\nand alteration that render the body subject to a new disease, and lend a\nhand to one another.  Those are excusable that content themselves with\npossessing us, without extending farther and introducing their followers;\nbut courteous and kind are those whose passage brings us any profitable\nissue.  Since I have been troubled with the stone, I find myself freed\nfrom all other accidents, much more, methinks, than I was before, and\nhave never had any fever since; I argue that the extreme and frequent\nvomitings that I am subject to purge me: and, on the other hand, my\ndistastes for this and that, and the strange fasts I am forced to keep,\ndigest my peccant humours, and nature, with those stones, voids whatever\nthere is in me superfluous and hurtful.  Let them never tell me that it\nis a medicine too dear bought: for what avail so many stinking draughts,\nso many caustics, incisions, sweats, setons, diets, and so many other\nmethods of cure, which often, by reason we are not able to undergo their\nviolence and importunity, bring us to our graves?  So that when I have\nthe stone, I look upon it as physic; when free from it, as an absolute\ndeliverance.\n\nAnd here is another particular benefit of my disease; which is, that it\nalmost plays its game by itself, and lets \u2018me play mine, if I have only\ncourage to do it; for, in its greatest fury, I have endured it ten hours\ntogether on horseback.  Do but endure only; you need no other regimen\nplay, run, dine, do this and t\u2019other, if you can; your debauch will do\nyou more good than harm; say as much to one that has the pox, the gout,\nor hernia!  The other diseases have more universal obligations; rack our\nactions after another kind of manner, disturb our whole order, and to\ntheir consideration engage the whole state of life: this only pinches the\nskin; it leaves the understanding and the will wholly at our own\ndisposal, and the tongue, the hands, and the feet; it rather awakens than\nstupefies you.  The soul is struck with the ardour of a fever,\noverwhelmed with an epilepsy, and displaced by a sharp megrim, and, in\nshort, astounded by all the diseases that hurt the whole mass and the\nmost noble parts; this never meddles with the soul; if anything goes\namiss with her, \u2018tis her own fault; she betrays, dismounts, and abandons\nherself.  There are none but fools who suffer themselves to be persuaded\nthat this hard and massive body which is baked in our kidneys is to be\ndissolved by drinks; wherefore, when it is once stirred, there is nothing\nto be done but to give it passage; and, for that matter, it will itself\nmake one.\n\nI moreover observe this particular convenience in it, that it is a\ndisease wherein we have little to guess at: we are dispensed from the\ntrouble into which other diseases throw us by the uncertainty of their\ncauses, conditions, and progress; a trouble that is infinitely painful:\nwe have no need of consultations and doctoral interpretations; the senses\nwell enough inform us both what it is and where it is.\n\nBy suchlike arguments, weak and strong, as Cicero with the disease of his\nold age, I try to rock asleep and amuse my imagination, and to dress its\nwounds.  If I find them worse tomorrow, I will provide new stratagems.\nThat this is true: I am come to that pass of late, that the least motion\nforces pure blood out of my kidneys: what of that?  I move about,\nnevertheless, as before, and ride after my hounds with a juvenile and\ninsolent ardour; and hold that I have very good satisfaction for an\naccident of that importance, when it costs me no more but a dull\nheaviness and uneasiness in that part; \u2018tis some great stone that wastes\nand consumes the substance of my kidneys and my life, which I by little\nand little evacuate, not without some natural pleasure, as an excrement\nhenceforward superfluous and troublesome.  Now if I feel anything\nstirring, do not fancy that I trouble myself to consult my pulse or my\nurine, thereby to put myself upon some annoying prevention; I shall soon\nenough feel the pain, without making it more and longer by the disease of\nfear.  He who fears he shall suffer, already suffers what he fears.  To\nwhich may be added that the doubts and ignorance of those who take upon\nthem to expound the designs of nature and her internal progressions, and\nthe many false prognostics of their art, ought to give us to understand\nthat her ways are inscrutable and utterly unknown; there is great\nuncertainty, variety, and obscurity in what she either promises or\nthreatens.  Old age excepted, which is an indubitable sign of the\napproach of death, in all other accidents I see few signs of the future,\nwhereon we may ground our divination.  I only judge of myself by actual\nsensation, not by reasoning: to what end, since I am resolved to bring\nnothing to it but expectation and patience?  Will you know how much I get\nby this? observe those who do otherwise, and who rely upon so many\ndiverse persuasions and counsels; how often the imagination presses upon\nthem without any bodily pain.  I have many times amused myself, being\nwell and in safety, and quite free from these dangerous attacks in\ncommunicating them to the physicians as then beginning to discover\nthemselves in me; I underwent the decree of their dreadful conclusions,\nbeing all the while quite at my ease, and so much the more obliged to the\nfavour of God and better satisfied of the vanity of this art.\n\nThere is nothing that ought so much to be recommended to youth as\nactivity and vigilance our life is nothing but movement.  I bestir myself\nwith great difficulty, and am slow in everything, whether in rising,\ngoing to bed, or eating: seven of the clock in the morning is early for\nme, and where I rule, I never dine before eleven, nor sup till after six.\nI formerly attributed the cause of the fevers and other diseases I fell\ninto to the heaviness that long sleeping had brought upon me, and have\never repented going to sleep again in the morning.  Plato is more angry\nat excess of sleeping than at excess of drinking.  I love to lie hard and\nalone, even without my wife, as kings do; pretty well covered with\nclothes.  They never warm my bed, but since I have grown old they give me\nat need cloths to lay to my feet and stomach.  They found fault with the\ngreat Scipio that he was a great sleeper; not, in my opinion, for any\nother reason than that men were displeased that he alone should have\nnothing in him to be found fault with.  If I am anything fastidious in my\nway of living \u2018tis rather in my lying than anything else; but generally\nI give way and accommodate myself as well as any one to necessity.\nSleeping has taken up a great part of my life, and I yet continue, at the\nage I now am, to sleep eight or nine hours at one breath.  I wean myself\nwith utility from this proneness to sloth, and am evidently the better\nfor so doing.  I find the change a little hard indeed, but in three days\n\u2018tis over; and I see but few who live with less sleep, when need\nrequires, and who more constantly exercise themselves, or to whom long\njourneys are less troublesome.  My body is capable of a firm, but not of\na violent or sudden agitation.  I escape of late from violent exercises,\nand such as make me sweat: my limbs grow weary before they are warm.\nI can stand a whole day together, and am never weary of walking; but from\nmy youth I have ever preferred to ride upon paved roads; on foot, I get\nup to the haunches in dirt, and little fellows as I am are subject in the\nstreets to be elbowed and jostled for want of presence; I have ever loved\nto repose myself, whether sitting or lying, with my heels as high or\nhigher than my seat.\n\nThere is no profession as pleasant as the military, a profession both\nnoble in its execution (for valour is the stoutest, proudest, and most\ngenerous of all virtues), and noble in its cause: there is no utility\neither more universal or more just than the protection of the peace and\ngreatness of one\u2019s country.  The company of so many noble, young, and\nactive men delights you; the ordinary sight of so many tragic spectacles;\nthe freedom of the conversation, without art; a masculine and\nunceremonious way of living, please you; the variety of a thousand\nseveral actions; the encouraging harmony of martial music that ravishes\nand inflames both your ears and souls; the honour of this occupation,\nnay, even its hardships and difficulties, which Plato holds so light that\nin his Republic he makes women and children share in them, are delightful\nto you.  You put yourself voluntarily upon particular exploits and\nhazards, according as you judge of their lustre and importance; and, a\nvolunteer, find even life itself excusably employed:\n\n               \u201cPulchrumque mori succurrit in armis.\u201d\n\n          [\u201c\u2018Tis fine to die sword in hand.\u201d (\u201cAnd he remembers that it\n          is honourable to die in arms.\u201d)--AEneid, ii. 317.]\n\n\nTo fear common dangers that concern so great a multitude of men; not to\ndare to do what so many sorts of souls, what a whole people dare, is for\na heart that is poor and mean beyond all measure: company encourages even\nchildren.  If others excel you in knowledge, in gracefulness, in\nstrength, or fortune, you have alternative resources at your disposal;\nbut to give place to them in stability of mind, you can blame no one for\nthat but yourself. Death is more abject, more languishing and\ntroublesome, in bed than in a fight: fevers and catarrhs as painful and\nmortal as a musket-shot.  Whoever has fortified himself valiantly to bear\nthe accidents of common life need not raise his courage to be a soldier:\n\n                    \u201cVivere, mi Lucili, militare est.\u201d\n\n          [\u201cTo live, my Lucilius, is (to make war) to be a soldier.\u201d\n           --Seneca, Ep., 96.]\n\nI do not remember that I ever had the itch, and yet scratching is one of\nnature\u2019s sweetest gratifications, and so much at hand; but repentance\nfollows too near.  I use it most in my ears, which are at intervals apt\nto itch.\n\nI came into the world with all my senses entire, even to perfection.  My\nstomach is commodiously good, as also is my head and my breath; and, for\nthe most part, uphold themselves so in the height of fevers.  I have\npassed the age to which some nations, not without reason, have prescribed\nso just a term of life that they would not suffer men to exceed it; and\nyet I have some intermissions, though short and inconstant, so clean and\nsound as to be little inferior to the health and pleasantness of my\nyouth.  I do not speak of vigour and sprightliness; \u2018tis not reason they\nshould follow me beyond their limits:\n\n               \u201cNon hoc amplius est liminis, aut aquae\n               Coelestis, patiens latus.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cI am no longer able to stand waiting at a door in the rain.\u201d\n      --Horace, Od., iii. 10, 9.]\n\nMy face and eyes presently discover my condition; all my alterations\nbegin there, and appear somewhat worse than they really are; my friends\noften pity me before I feel the cause in myself.  My looking-glass does\nnot frighten me; for even in my youth it has befallen me more than once\nto have a scurvy complexion and of ill augury, without any great\nconsequence, so that the physicians, not finding any cause within\nanswerable to that outward alteration, attributed it to the mind and to\nsome secret passion that tormented me within; but they were deceived.\nIf my body would govern itself as well, according to my rule, as my mind\ndoes, we should move a little more at our ease.  My mind was then not\nonly free from trouble, but, moreover, full of joy and satisfaction,\nas it commonly is, half by its complexion, half by its design:\n\n               \u201cNec vitiant artus aegrae contagia mentis.\u201d\n\n          [\u201cNor do the troubles of the body ever affect my mind.\u201d\n           --Ovid, Trist., iii. 8, 25.]\n\nI am of the opinion that this temperature of my soul has often raised my\nbody from its lapses; this is often depressed; if the other be not brisk\nand gay, \u2018tis at least tranquil and at rest.  I had a quartan ague four\nor five months, that made me look miserably ill; my mind was always, if\nnot calm, yet pleasant.  If the pain be without me, the weakness and\nlanguor do not much afflict me; I see various corporal faintings, that\nbeget a horror in me but to name, which yet I should less fear than a\nthousand passions and agitations of the mind that I see about me.  I make\nup my mind no more to run; \u2018tis enough that I can crawl along; nor do I\nmore complain of the natural decadence that I feel in myself:\n\n               \u201cQuis tumidum guttur miratur in Alpibus?\u201d\n\n          [\u201cWho is surprised to see a swollen goitre in the Alps?\u201d\n           --Juvenal, xiii. 162.]\n\nthan I regret that my duration shall not be as long and entire as that of\nan oak.\n\nI have no reason to complain of my imagination; I have had few thoughts\nin my life that have so much as broken my sleep, except those of desire,\nwhich have awakened without afflicting me.  I dream but seldom, and then\nof chimaeras and fantastic things, commonly produced from pleasant\nthoughts, and rather ridiculous than sad; and I believe it to be true\nthat dreams are faithful interpreters of our inclinations; but there is\nart required to sort and understand them\n\n    \u201cRes, quae in vita usurpant homines, cogitant, curant, vident,\n     Quaeque agunt vigilantes, agitantque, ea si cui in somno accidunt,\n     Minus mirandum est.\u201d\n\n     [\u201c\u2018Tis less wonder, what men practise, think, care for, see, and do\n     when waking, (should also run in their heads and disturb them when\n     they are asleep) and which affect their feelings, if they happen to\n     any in sleep.\u201d--Attius, cited in Cicero, De Divin., i. 22.]\n\nPlato, moreover, says, that \u2018tis the office of prudence to draw\ninstructions of divination of future things from dreams: I don\u2019t know\nabout this, but there are wonderful instances of it that Socrates,\nXenophon, and Aristotle, men of irreproachable authority, relate.\nHistorians say that the Atlantes never dream; who also never eat any\nanimal food, which I add, forasmuch as it is, peradventure, the reason\nwhy they never dream, for Pythagoras ordered a certain preparation of\ndiet to beget appropriate dreams.  Mine are very gentle, without any\nagitation of body or expression of voice.  I have seen several of my time\nwonderfully disturbed by them.  Theon the philosopher walked in his\nsleep, and so did Pericles servant, and that upon the tiles and top of\nthe house.\n\nI hardly ever choose my dish at table, but take the next at hand, and\nunwillingly change it for another.  A confusion of meats and a clatter of\ndishes displease me as much as any other confusion: I am easily satisfied\nwith few dishes: and am an enemy to the opinion of Favorinus, that in a\nfeast they should snatch from you the meat you like, and set a plate of\nanother sort before you; and that \u2018tis a pitiful supper, if you do not\nsate your guests with the rumps of various fowls, the beccafico only\ndeserving to be all eaten.  I usually eat salt meats, yet I prefer bread\nthat has no salt in it; and my baker never sends up other to my table,\ncontrary to the custom of the country.  In my infancy, what they had most\nto correct in me was the refusal of things that children commonly best\nlove, as sugar, sweetmeats, and march-panes.  My tutor contended with\nthis aversion to delicate things, as a kind of over-nicety; and indeed\n\u2018tis nothing else but a difficulty of taste, in anything it applies\nitself to.  Whoever cures a child of an obstinate liking for brown bread,\nbacon, or garlic, cures him also of pampering his palate.  There are some\nwho affect temperance and plainness by wishing for beef and ham amongst\nthe partridges; \u2018tis all very fine; this is the delicacy of the delicate;\n\u2018tis the taste of an effeminate fortune that disrelishes ordinary and\naccustomed things.\n\n               \u201cPer qux luxuria divitiarum taedio ludit.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cBy which the luxury of wealth causes tedium.\u201d--Seneca, Ep., 18.]\n\nNot to make good cheer with what another is enjoying, and to be curious\nin what a man eats, is the essence of this vice:\n\n               \u201cSi modica coenare times olus omne patella.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cIf you can\u2019t be content with herbs in a small dish for supper.\u201d\n      --Horace, Ep., i. 5, 2.]\n\nThere is indeed this difference, that \u2018tis better to oblige one\u2019s\nappetite to things that are most easy to be had; but \u2018tis always vice to\noblige one\u2019s self.  I formerly said a kinsman of mine was overnice, who,\nby being in our galleys, had unlearned the use of beds and to undress\nwhen he went to sleep.\n\nIf I had any sons, I should willingly wish them my fortune.  The good\nfather that God gave me (who has nothing of me but the acknowledgment of\nhis goodness, but truly \u2018tis a very hearty one) sent me from my cradle to\nbe brought up in a poor village of his, and there continued me all the\nwhile I was at nurse, and still longer, bringing me up to the meanest and\nmost common way of living:\n\n          \u201cMagna pars libertatis est bene moratus venter.\u201d\n\n          [\u201cA well-governed stomach is a great part of liberty.\u201d\n           --Seneca,Ep., 123.]\n\nNever take upon yourselves, and much less give up to your wives, the care\nof their nurture; leave the formation to fortune, under popular and\nnatural laws; leave it to custom to train them up to frugality and\nhardship, that they may rather descend from rigour than mount up to it.\nThis humour of his yet aimed at another end, to make me familiar with the\npeople and the condition of men who most need our assistance; considering\nthat I should rather regard them who extend their arms to me, than those\nwho turn their backs upon me; and for this reason it was that he provided\nto hold me at the font persons of the meanest fortune, to oblige and\nattach me to them.\n\nNor has his design succeeded altogether ill; for, whether upon the\naccount of the more honour in such a condescension, or out of a natural\ncompassion that has a very great power over me, I have an inclination\ntowards the meaner sort of people.  The faction which I should condemn in\nour wars, I should more sharply condemn, flourishing and successful; it\nwill somewhat reconcile me to it, when I shall see it miserable and\noverwhelmed.  How willingly do I admire the fine humour of Cheilonis,\ndaughter and wife to kings of Sparta.  Whilst her husband Cleombrotus, in\nthe commotion of her city, had the advantage over Leonidas her father,\nshe, like a good daughter, stuck close to her father in all his misery\nand exile, in opposition to the conqueror.  But so soon as the chance of\nwar turned, she changed her will with the change of fortune, and bravely\nturned to her husband\u2019s side, whom she accompanied throughout, where his\nruin carried him: admitting, as it appears to me, no other choice than to\ncleave to the side that stood most in need of her, and where she could\nbest manifest her compassion.  I am naturally more apt to follow the\nexample of Flaminius, who rather gave his assistance to those who had\nmost need of him than to those who had power to do him good, than I do to\nthat of Pyrrhus, who was of an humour to truckle under the great and to\ndomineer over the poor.\n\nLong sittings at table both trouble me and do me harm; for, be it that I\nwas so accustomed when a child, I eat all the while I sit.  Therefore it\nis that at my own house, though the meals there are of the shortest, I\nusually sit down a little while after the rest, after the manner of\nAugustus, but I do not imitate him in rising also before the rest; on the\ncontrary, I love to sit still a long time after, and to hear them talk,\nprovided I am none of the talkers: for I tire and hurt myself with\nspeaking upon a full stomach, as much as I find it very wholesome and\npleasant to argue and to strain my voice before dinner.\n\nThe ancient Greeks and Romans had more reason than we in setting apart\nfor eating, which is a principal action of life, if they were not\nprevented by other extraordinary business, many hours and the greatest\npart of the night; eating and drinking more deliberately than we do, who\nperform all our actions post-haste; and in extending this natural\npleasure to more leisure and better use, intermixing with profitable\nconversation.\n\nThey whose concern it is to have a care of me, may very easily hinder me\nfrom eating anything they think will do me harm; for in such matters I\nnever covet nor miss anything I do not see; but withal, if it once comes\nin my sight, \u2018tis in vain to persuade me to forbear; so that when I\ndesign to fast I must be kept apart from the suppers, and must have only\nso much given me as is required for a prescribed collation; for if to\ntable, I forget my resolution.  When I order my cook to alter the manner\nof dressing any dish, all my family know what it means, that my stomach\nis out of order, and that I shall not touch it.\n\nI love to have all meats, that will endure it, very little boiled or\nroasted, and prefer them very high, and even, as to several, quite gone.\nNothing but hardness generally offends me (of any other quality I am as\npatient and indifferent as any man I have known); so that, contrary to\nthe common humour, even in fish it often happens that I find them both\ntoo fresh and too firm; not for want of teeth, which I ever had good,\neven to excellence, and which age does not now begin to threaten; I have\nalways been used every morning to rub them with a napkin, and before and\nafter dinner.  God is favourable to those whom He makes to die by\ndegrees; \u2018tis the only benefit of old age; the last death will be so much\nthe less painful; it will kill but a half or a quarter of a man.  There\nis one tooth lately fallen out without drawing and without pain; it was\nthe natural term of its duration; in that part of my being and several\nothers, are already dead, others half dead, of those that were most\nactive and in the first rank during my vigorous years; \u2018tis so I melt and\nsteal away from myself.  What a folly it would be in my understanding to\napprehend the height of this fall, already so much advanced, as if it\nwere from the very top!  I hope I shall not.  I, in truth, receive a\nprincipal consolation in meditating my death, that it will be just and\nnatural, and that henceforward I cannot herein either require or hope\nfrom Destiny any other but unlawful favour.  Men make themselves believe\nthat we formerly had longer lives as well as greater stature.  But they\ndeceive themselves; and Solon, who was of those elder times, limits the\nduration of life to threescore and ten years. I, who have so much and so\nuniversally adored that \u201cThe mean is best,\u201d of the passed time, and who\nhave concluded the most moderate measures to be the most perfect, shall\nI pretend to an immeasurable and prodigious old age?  Whatever happens\ncontrary to the course of nature may be troublesome; but what comes\naccording to her should always be pleasant:\n\n     \u201cOmnia, quae secundum naturam fiunt, sunt habenda in bonis.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cAll things that are done according to nature\n     are to be accounted good.\u201d--Cicero, De Senect., c. 19.]\n\nAnd so, says Plato, the death which is occasioned by wounds and diseases\nis violent; but that which comes upon us, old age conducting us to it, is\nof all others the most easy, and in some sort delicious:\n\n          \u201cVitam adolescentibus vis aufert, senibus maturitas.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cYoung men are taken away by violence, old men by maturity.\u201d\n      --Cicero, ubi sup.]\n\nDeath mixes and confounds itself throughout with life; decay anticipates\nits hour, and shoulders itself even into the course of our advance.\nI have portraits of myself taken at five-and-twenty and five-and-thirty\nyears of age.  I compare them with that lately drawn: how many times is\nit no longer me; how much more is my present image unlike the former,\nthan unlike my dying one?  It is too much to abuse nature, to make her\ntrot so far that she must be forced to leave us, and abandon our conduct,\nour eyes, teeth, legs, and all the rest to the mercy of a foreign and\nhaggard countenance, and to resign us into the hands of art, being weary\nof following us herself.\n\nI am not excessively fond either of salads or fruits, except melons.  My\nfather hated all sorts of sauces; I love them all.  Eating too much hurts\nme; but, as to the quality of what I eat, I do not yet certainly know\nthat any sort of meat disagrees with me; neither have I observed that\neither full moon or decrease, autumn or spring, have any influence upon\nme.  We have in us motions that are inconstant and unknown; for example,\nI found radishes first grateful to my stomach, since that nauseous, and\nnow again grateful.  In several other things, I find my stomach and\nappetite vary after the same manner; I have changed again and again from\nwhite wine to claret, from claret to white wine.\n\nI am a great lover of fish, and consequently make my fasts feasts and\nfeasts fasts; and I believe what some people say, that it is more easy of\ndigestion than flesh.  As I make a conscience of eating flesh upon\nfish-days, so does my taste make a conscience of mixing fish and flesh;\nthe difference betwixt them seems to me too remote.\n\nFrom my youth, I have sometimes kept out of the way at meals; either to\nsharpen my appetite against the next morning (for, as Epicurus fasted and\nmade lean meals to accustom his pleasure to make shift without abundance,\nI, on the contrary, do it to prepare my pleasure to make better and more\ncheerful use of abundance); or else I fasted to preserve my vigour for\nthe service of some action of body or mind: for both the one and the\nother of these is cruelly dulled in me by repletion; and, above all\nthings, I hate that foolish coupling of so healthful and sprightly a\ngoddess with that little belching god, bloated with the fumes of his\nliquor--[ Montaigne did not approve of coupling Bacchus with Venus.]--\nor to cure my sick stomach, or for want of fit company; for I say, as the\nsame Epicurus did, that one is not so much to regard what he eats, as\nwith whom; and I commend Chilo, that he would not engage himself to be at\nPeriander\u2019s feast till he was first informed who were to be the other\nguests; no dish is so acceptable to me, nor no sauce so appetising, as\nthat which is extracted from society.  I think it more wholesome to eat\nmore leisurely and less, and to eat oftener; but I would have appetite\nand hunger attended to; I should take no pleasure to be fed with three or\nfour pitiful and stinted repasts a day, after a medicinal manner: who\nwill assure me that, if I have a good appetite in the morning, I shall\nhave the same at supper?  But we old fellows especially, let us take the\nfirst opportune time of eating, and leave to almanac-makers hopes and\nprognostics.  The utmost fruit of my health is pleasure; let us take hold\nof the present and known.  I avoid the invariable in these laws of\nfasting; he who would have one form serve him, let him avoid the\ncontinuing it; we harden ourselves in it; our strength is there stupefied\nand laid asleep; six months after, you shall find your stomach so inured\nto it, that all you have got is the loss of your liberty of doing\notherwise but to your prejudice.\n\nI never keep my legs and thighs warmer in winter than in summer; one\nsimple pair of silk stockings is all.  I have suffered myself, for the\nrelief of my colds, to keep my head warmer, and my belly upon the account\nof my colic: my diseases in a few days habituate themselves thereto, and\ndisdained my ordinary provisions: we soon get from a coif to a kerchief\nover it, from a simple cap to a quilted hat; the trimmings of the doublet\nmust not merely serve for ornament: there must be added a hare\u2019s skin or\na vulture\u2019s skin, and a cap under the hat: follow this gradation, and you\nwill go a very fine way to work.  I will do nothing of the sort, and\nwould willingly leave off what I have begun.  If you fall into any new\ninconvenience, all this is labour lost; you are accustomed to it; seek\nout some other.  Thus do they destroy themselves who submit to be\npestered with these enforced and superstitious rules; they must add\nsomething more, and something more after that; there is no end on\u2019t.\n\nFor what concerns our affairs and pleasures, it is much more commodious,\nas the ancients did, to lose one\u2019s dinner, and defer making good cheer\ntill the hour of retirement and repose, without breaking up a day; and so\nwas I formerly used to do.  As to health, I since by experience find, on\nthe contrary, that it is better to dine, and that the digestion is better\nwhile awake.  I am not very used to be thirsty, either well or sick; my\nmouth is, indeed, apt to be dry, but without thirst; and commonly I never\ndrink but with thirst that is created by eating, and far on in the meal;\nI drink pretty well for a man of my pitch: in summer, and at a relishing\nmeal, I do not only exceed the limits of Augustus, who drank but thrice\nprecisely; but not to offend Democritus rule, who forbade that men should\nstop at four times as an unlucky number, I proceed at need to the fifth\nglass, about three half-pints; for the little glasses are my favourites,\nand I like to drink them off, which other people avoid as an unbecoming\nthing.  I mix my wine sometimes with half, sometimes with the third part\nwater; and when I am at home, by an ancient custom that my father\u2019s\nphysician prescribed both to him and himself, they mix that which is\ndesigned for me in the buttery, two or three hours before \u2018tis brought\nin.  \u2018Tis said that Cranabs, king of Attica, was the inventor of this\ncustom of diluting wine; whether useful or no, I have heard disputed.\nI think it more decent and wholesome for children to drink no wine till\nafter sixteen or eighteen years of age.  The most usual and common method\nof living is the most becoming; all particularity, in my opinion, is to\nbe avoided; and I should as much hate a German who mixed water with his\nwine, as I should a Frenchman who drank it pure.  Public usage gives the\nlaw in these things.\n\nI fear a mist, and fly from smoke as from the plague: the first repairs I\nfell upon in my own house were the chimneys and houses of office, the\ncommon and insupportable defects of all old buildings; and amongst the\ndifficulties of war I reckon the choking dust they made us ride in a\nwhole day together.  I have a free and easy respiration, and my colds for\nthe most part go off without offence to the lungs and without a cough.\n\nThe heat of summer is more an enemy to me than the cold of winter; for,\nbesides the incommodity of heat, less remediable than cold, and besides\nthe force of the sunbeams that strike upon the head, all glittering light\noffends my eyes, so that I could not now sit at dinner over against a\nflaming fire.\n\nTo dull the whiteness of paper, in those times when I was more wont to\nread, I laid a piece of glass upon my book, and found my eyes much\nrelieved by it.  I am to this hour--to the age of fifty-four--Ignorant of\nthe use of spectacles; and I can see as far as ever I did, or any other.\n\u2018Tis true that in the evening I begin to find a little disturbance and\nweakness in my sight if I read, an exercise I have always found\ntroublesome, especially by night.  Here is one step back, and a very\nmanifest one; I shall retire another: from the second to the third, and\nso to the fourth, so gently, that I shall be stark blind before I shall\nbe sensible of the age and decay of my sight: so artificially do the\nFatal Sisters untwist our lives.  And so I doubt whether my hearing\nbegins to grow thick; and you will see I shall have half lost it, when I\nshall still lay the fault on the voices of those who speak to me.  A man\nmust screw up his soul to a high pitch to make it sensible how it ebbs\naway.\n\nMy walking is quick and firm; and I know not which of the two, my mind or\nmy body, I have most to do to keep in the same state.  That preacher is\nvery much my friend who can fix my attention a whole sermon through: in\nplaces of ceremony, where every one\u2019s countenance is so starched, where I\nhave seen the ladies keep even their eyes so fixed, I could never order\nit so, that some part or other of me did not lash out; so that though I\nwas seated, I was never settled; and as to gesticulation, I am never\nwithout a switch in my hand, walking or riding.  As the philosopher\nChrysippus\u2019 maid said of her master, that he was only drunk in his legs,\nfor it was his custom to be always kicking them about in what place\nsoever he sat; and she said it when, the wine having made all his\ncompanions drunk, he found no alteration in himself at all; it may have\nbeen said of me from my infancy, that I had either folly or quicksilver\nin my feet, so much stirring and unsettledness there is in them, wherever\nthey are placed.\n\n\u2018Tis indecent, besides the hurt it does to one\u2019s health, and even to the\npleasure of eating, to eat greedily as I do; I often bite my tongue, and\nsometimes my fingers, in my haste.  Diogenes, meeting a boy eating after\nthat manner, gave his tutor a box on the ear!  There were men at Rome\nthat taught people to chew, as well as to walk, with a good grace.  I\nlose thereby the leisure of speaking, which gives great relish to the\ntable, provided the discourse be suitable, that is, pleasant and short.\n\nThere is jealousy and envy amongst our pleasures; they cross and hinder\none another.  Alcibiades, a man who well understood how to make good\ncheer, banished even music from the table, that it might not disturb the\nentertainment of discourse, for the reason, as Plato tells us, \u201cthat it\nis the custom of ordinary people to call fiddlers and singing men to\nfeasts, for want of good discourse and pleasant talk, with which men of\nunderstanding know how to entertain one another.\u201d  Varro requires all\nthis in entertainments: \u201cPersons of graceful presence and agreeable\nconversation, who are neither silent nor garrulous; neatness and\ndelicacy, both of meat and place; and fair weather.\u201d  The art of dining\nwell is no slight art, the pleasure not a slight pleasure; neither the\ngreatest captains nor the greatest philosophers have disdained the use or\nscience of eating well.  My imagination has delivered three repasts to\nthe custody of my memory, which fortune rendered sovereignly sweet to me,\nupon several occasions in my more flourishing age; my present state\nexcludes me; for every one, according to the good temper of body and mind\nwherein he then finds himself, furnishes for his own share a particular\ngrace and savour.  I, who but crawl upon the earth, hate this inhuman\nwisdom, that will have us despise and hate all culture of the body; I\nlook upon it as an equal injustice to loath natural pleasures as to be\ntoo much in love with them.  Xerxes was a blockhead, who, environed with\nall human delights, proposed a reward to him who could find out others;\nbut he is not much less so who cuts off any of those pleasures that\nnature has provided for him.  A man should neither pursue nor avoid them,\nbut receive them.  I receive them, I confess, a little too warmly and\nkindly, and easily suffer myself to follow my natural propensions.  We\nhave no need to exaggerate their inanity; they themselves will make us\nsufficiently sensible of it, thanks to our sick wet-blanket mind, that\nputs us out of taste with them as with itself; it treats both itself and\nall it receives, one while better, and another worse, according to its\ninsatiable, vagabond, and versatile essence:\n\n         \u201cSincerum est nisi vas, quodcunque infundis, acescit.\u201d\n\n          [\u201cUnless the vessel be clean, it will sour whatever\n          you put into it.\u201d--Horace, Ep., i. 2, 54.]\n\nI, who boast that I so curiously and particularly embrace the\nconveniences of life, find them, when I most nearly consider them, very\nlittle more than wind.  But what?  We are all wind throughout; and,\nmoreover, the wind itself, more discreet than we, loves to bluster and\nshift from corner to corner, and contents itself with its proper offices\nwithout desiring stability and solidity-qualities not its own.\n\nThe pure pleasures, as well as the pure displeasures, of the imagination,\nsay some, are the greatest, as was expressed by the balance of\nCritolaiis.  \u2018Tis no wonder; it makes them to its own liking, and cuts\nthem out of the whole cloth; of this I every day see notable examples,\nand, peradventure, to be desired.  But I, who am of a mixed and heavy\ncondition, cannot snap so soon at this one simple object, but that I\nnegligently suffer myself to be carried away with the present pleasures\nof the, general human law, intellectually sensible, and sensibly\nintellectual.  The Cyrenaic philosophers will have it that as corporal\npains, so corporal pleasures are more powerful, both as double and as\nmore just.  There are some, as Aristotle says, who out of a savage kind\nof stupidity dislike them; and I know others who out of ambition do the\nsame.  Why do they not, moreover, forswear breathing?  why do they not\nlive of their own?  why not refuse light, because it is gratuitous, and\ncosts them neither invention nor exertion?  Let Mars, Pallas, or Mercury\nafford them their light by which to see, instead of Venus, Ceres, and\nBacchus.  These boastful humours may counterfeit some content, for what\nwill not fancy do?  But as to wisdom, there is no touch of it.  Will they\nnot seek the quadrature of the circle, even when on their wives?  I hate\nthat we should be enjoined to have our minds in the clouds, when our\nbodies are at table; I would not have the mind nailed there, nor wallow\nthere; I would have it take place there and sit, but not lie down.\nAristippus maintained nothing but the body, as if we had no soul; Zeno\ncomprehended only the soul, as if we had no body: both of them faultily.\nPythagoras, they say, followed a philosophy that was all contemplation,\nSocrates one that was all conduct and action; Plato found a mean betwixt\nthe two; but they only say this for the sake of talking.  The true\ntemperament is found in Socrates; and, Plato is much more Socratic than\nPythagoric, and it becomes him better.  When I dance, I dance; when I\nsleep, I sleep.  Nay, when I walk alone in a beautiful orchard, if my\nthoughts are some part of the time taken up with external occurrences,\nI some part of the time call them back again to my walk, to the orchard,\nto the sweetness of that solitude, and to myself.\n\nNature has mother-like observed this, that the actions she has enjoined\nus for our necessity should be also pleasurable to us; and she invites us\nto them, not only by reason, but also by appetite, and \u2018tis injustice to\ninfringe her laws.  When I see alike Caesar and Alexander, in the midst\nof his greatest business, so fully enjoy human and corporal pleasures, I\ndo not say that he relaxed his mind: I say that he strengthened it, by\nvigour of courage subjecting those violent employments and laborious\nthoughts to the ordinary usage of life: wise, had he believed the last\nwas his ordinary, the first his extraordinary, vocation.  We are great\nfools.  \u201cHe has passed his life in idleness,\u201d say we: \u201cI have done\nnothing to-day.\u201d  What? have you not lived?  that is not only the\nfundamental, but the most illustrious, of your occupations.  \u201cHad I been\nput to the management of great affairs, I should have made it seen what I\ncould do.\u201d  \u201cHave you known how to meditate and manage your life?  you\nhave performed the greatest work of all.\u201d  In order to shew and develop\nherself, nature needs only fortune; she equally manifests herself in all\nstages, and behind a curtain as well as without one.  Have you known how\nto regulate your conduct, you have done a great deal more than he who has\ncomposed books.  Have you known how to take repose, you have done more\nthan he who has taken empires and cities.\n\nThe glorious masterpiece of man is to live to purpose; all other things:\nto reign, to lay up treasure, to build, are but little appendices and\nprops.  I take pleasure in seeing a general of an army, at the foot of a\nbreach he is presently to assault, give himself up entire and free at\ndinner, to talk and be merry with his friends.  And Brutus, when heaven\nand earth were conspired against him and the Roman liberty, stealing some\nhour of the night from his rounds to read and scan Polybius in all\nsecurity.  \u2018Tis for little souls, buried under the weight of affairs, not\nfrom them to know how clearly to disengage themselves, not to know how to\nlay them aside and take them up again:\n\n                   \u201cO fortes, pejoraque passi\n                    Mecum saepe viri!  nunc vino pellite curas\n                    Cras ingens iterabimus aequor.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cO brave spirits, who have often suffered sorrow with me, drink\n     cares away; tomorrow we will embark once more on the vast sea.\u201d\n      --Horace, Od., i. 7, 30.]\n\nWhether it be in jest or earnest, that the theological and Sorbonnical\nwine, and their feasts, are turned into a proverb, I find it reasonable\nthey should dine so much more commodiously and pleasantly, as they have\nprofitably and seriously employed the morning in the exercise of their\nschools.  The conscience of having well spent the other hours, is the\njust and savoury sauce of the dinner-table.  The sages lived after that\nmanner; and that inimitable emulation to virtue, which astonishes us both\nin the one and the other Cato, that humour of theirs, so severe as even\nto be importunate, gently submits itself and yields to the laws of the\nhuman condition, of Venus and Bacchus; according to the precepts of their\nsect, that require the perfect sage to be as expert and intelligent in\nthe use of natural pleasures as in all other duties of life:\n\n               \u201cCui cor sapiat, ei et sapiat palatus.\u201d\n\nRelaxation and facility, methinks, wonderfully honour and best become a\nstrong and generous soul.  Epaminondas did not think that to take part,\nand that heartily, in songs and sports and dances with the young men of\nhis city, were things that in any way derogated from the honour of his\nglorious victories and the perfect purity of manners that was in him.\nAnd amongst so many admirable actions of Scipio the grandfather, a person\nworthy to be reputed of a heavenly extraction, there is nothing that\ngives him a greater grace than to see him carelessly and childishly\ntrifling at gathering and selecting cockle shells, and playing at quoits,\n\n     [This game, as the \u201cDictionnaire de Trevoux\u201d describes it, is one\n     wherein two persons contend which of them shall soonest pick up some\n     object.]\n\namusing and tickling himself in representing by writing in comedies the\nmeanest and most popular actions of men.  And his head full of that\nwonderful enterprise of Hannibal and Africa, visiting the schools in\nSicily, and attending philosophical lectures, to the extent of arming the\nblind envy of his enemies at Rome.  Nor is there anything more remarkable\nin Socrates than that, old as he was, he found time to make himself\ntaught dancing and playing upon instruments, and thought it time well\nspent.  This same man was seen in an ecstasy, standing upon his feet a\nwhole day and a night together, in the presence of all the Grecian army,\nsurprised and absorbed by some profound thought.  He was the first,\namongst so many valiant men of the army, to run to the relief of\nAlcibiades, oppressed with the enemy, to shield him with his own body,\nand disengage him from the crowd by absolute force of arms.  It was he\nwho, in the Delian battle, raised and saved Xenophon when fallen from his\nhorse; and who, amongst all the people of Athens, enraged as he was at so\nunworthy a spectacle, first presented himself to rescue Theramenes, whom\nthe thirty tyrants were leading to execution by their satellites, and\ndesisted not from his bold enterprise but at the remonstrance of\nTheramenes himself, though he was only followed by two more in all.  He\nwas seen, when courted by a beauty with whom he was in love, to maintain\nat need a severe abstinence.  He was seen ever to go to the wars, and\nwalk upon ice, with bare feet; to wear the same robe, winter and summer;\nto surpass all his companions in patience of bearing hardships, and to\neat no more at a feast than at his own private dinner.  He was seen, for\nseven-and-twenty years together, to endure hunger, poverty, the\nindocility of his children, and the nails of his wife, with the same\ncountenance.  And, in the end, calumny, tyranny, imprisonment, fetters,\nand poison.  But was this man obliged to drink full bumpers by any rule\nof civility?  he was also the man of the whole army with whom the\nadvantage in drinking, remained.  And he never refused to play at\nnoisettes, nor to ride the hobby-horse with children, and it became him\nwell; for all actions, says philosophy, equally become and equally honour\na wise man.  We have enough wherewithal to do it, and we ought never to\nbe weary of presenting the image of this great man in all the patterns\nand forms of perfection.  There are very few examples of life, full and\npure; and we wrong our teaching every day, to propose to ourselves those\nthat are weak and imperfect, scarce good for any one service, and rather\npull us back; corrupters rather than correctors of manners.  The people\ndeceive themselves; a man goes much more easily indeed by the ends, where\nthe extremity serves for a bound, a stop, and guide, than by the middle\nway, large and open; and according to art, more than according to nature:\nbut withal much less nobly and commendably.\n\nGreatness of soul consists not so much in mounting and in pressing\nforward, as in knowing how to govern and circumscribe itself; it takes\neverything for great, that is enough, and demonstrates itself in\npreferring moderate to eminent things.  There is nothing so fine and\nlegitimate as well and duly to play the man; nor science so arduous as\nwell and naturally to know how to live this life; and of all the\ninfirmities we have, \u2018tis the most barbarous to despise our being.\n\nWhoever has a mind to isolate his spirit, when the body is ill at ease,\nto preserve it from the contagion, let him by all means do it if he can:\nbut otherwise let him on the contrary favour and assist it, and not\nrefuse to participate of its natural pleasures with a conjugal\ncomplacency, bringing to it, if it be the wiser, moderation, lest by\nindiscretion they should get confounded with displeasure.  Intemperance\nis the pest of pleasure; and temperance is not its scourge, but rather\nits seasoning.  Euxodus, who therein established the sovereign good, and\nhis companions, who set so high a value upon it, tasted it in its most\ncharming sweetness, by the means of temperance, which in them was\nsingular and exemplary.\n\nI enjoin my soul to look upon pain and pleasure with an eye equally\nregulated:\n\n          \u201cEodem enim vitio est effusio animi in laetitia\n          quo in dolore contractio,\u201d\n\n     [\u201cFor from the same imperfection arises the expansion of the\n     mind in pleasure and its contraction in sorrow.\u201d\n      --Cicero, Tusc.  Quaes., iv. 31.]\n\nand equally firm; but the one gaily and the other severely, and so far as\nit is able, to be careful to extinguish the one as to extend the other.\nThe judging rightly of good brings along with it the judging soundly of\nevil: pain has something of the inevitable in its tender beginnings, and\npleasure something of the evitable in its excessive end.  Plato couples\nthem together, and wills that it should be equally the office of\nfortitude to fight against pain, and against the immoderate and charming\nblandishments of pleasure: they are two fountains, from which whoever\ndraws, when and as much as he needs, whether city, man, or beast, is very\nfortunate.  The first is to be taken medicinally and upon necessity, and\nmore scantily; the other for thirst, but not to, drunkenness.  Pain,\npleasure, love and hatred are the first things that a child is sensible\nof: if, when reason comes, they apply it to themselves, that is virtue.\n\nI have a special vocabulary of my own; I \u201cpass away time,\u201d when it is ill\nand uneasy, but when \u2018tis good I do not pass it away: \u201cI taste it over\nagain and adhere to it\u201d; one must run over the ill and settle upon the\ngood.  This ordinary phrase of pastime, and passing away the time,\nrepresents the usage of those wise sort of people who think they cannot\ndo better with their lives than to let them run out and slide away, pass\nthem over, and baulk them, and, as much as they can, ignore them and shun\nthem as a thing of troublesome and contemptible quality: but I know it to\nbe another kind of thing, and find it both valuable and commodious, even\nin its latest decay, wherein I now enjoy it; and nature has delivered it\ninto our hands in such and so favourable circumstances that we have only\nourselves to blame if it be troublesome to us, or escapes us\nunprofitably:\n\n     \u201cStulti vita ingrata est, trepida est, tota in futurum fertur.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThe life of a fool is thankless, timorous, and wholly bent upon\n     the future.\u201d--Seneca, Ep:, 15.]\n\nNevertheless I compose myself to lose mine without regret; but withal as\na thing that is perishable by its condition, not that it molests or\nannoys me.  Nor does it properly well become any not to be displeased\nwhen they die, excepting such as are pleased to live.  There is good\nhusbandry in enjoying it: I enjoy it double to what others do; for the\nmeasure of its fruition depends upon our more or less application to it.\nChiefly that I perceive mine to be so short in time, I desire to extend\nit in weight; I will stop the promptitude of its flight by the\npromptitude of my grasp; and by the vigour of using it compensate the\nspeed of its running away.  In proportion as the possession of life is\nmore short, I must make it so much deeper and fuller.\n\nOthers feel the pleasure of content and prosperity; I feel it too, as\nwell as they, but not as it passes and slips by; one should study, taste,\nand ruminate upon it to render condign thanks to Him who grants it to us.\nThey enjoy the other pleasures as they do that of sleep, without knowing\nit.  To the end that even sleep itself should not so stupidly escape from\nme, I have formerly caused myself to be disturbed in my sleep, so that I\nmight the better and more sensibly relish and taste it.  I ponder with\nmyself of content; I do not skim over, but sound it; and I bend my\nreason, now grown perverse and peevish, to entertain it.  Do I find\nmyself in any calm composedness?  is there any pleasure that tickles me?\nI do not suffer it to dally with my senses only; I associate my soul to\nit too: not there to engage itself, but therein to take delight; not\nthere to lose itself, but to be present there; and I employ it, on its\npart, to view itself in this prosperous state, to weigh and appreciate\nits happiness and to amplify it.  It reckons how much it stands indebted\nto God that its conscience and the intestine passions are in repose; that\nit has the body in its natural disposition, orderly and competently\nenjoying the soft and soothing functions by which He, of His grace is\npleased to compensate the sufferings wherewith His justice at His good\npleasure chastises us.  It reflects how great a benefit it is to be so\nprotected, that which way soever it turns its eye the heavens are calm\naround it.  No desire, no fear, no doubt, troubles the air; no\ndifficulty, past, present, or to, come, that its imagination may not pass\nover without offence.  This consideration takes great lustre from the\ncomparison of different conditions.  So it is that I present to my\nthought, in a thousand aspects, those whom fortune or their own error\ncarries away and torments.  And, again, those who, more like to me, so\nnegligently and incuriously receive their good fortune.  Those are folks\nwho spend their time indeed; they pass over the present and that which\nthey possess, to wait on hope, and for shadows and vain images which\nfancy puts before them:\n\n         \u201cMorte obita quales fama est volitare figuras,\n          Aut quae sopitos deludunt somnia sensus:\u201d\n\n     [\u201cSuch forms as those which after death are reputed to hover about,\n     or dreams which delude the senses in sleep.\u201d--AEneid, x. 641.]\n\nwhich hasten and prolong their flight, according as they are pursued.\nThe fruit and end of their pursuit is to pursue; as Alexander said, that\nthe end of his labour was to labour:\n\n          \u201cNil actum credens, cum quid superesset agendum.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cThinking nothing done, if anything remained to be done.\n     --\u201cLucan, ii. 657.]\n\nFor my part then, I love life and cultivate it, such as it has pleased\nGod to bestow it upon us.  I do not desire it should be without the\nnecessity of eating and drinking; and I should think it a not less\nexcusable failing to wish it had been twice as long;\n\n     \u201cSapiens divitiarum naturalium quaesitor acerrimus:\u201d\n\n     [\u201cA wise man is the keenest seeker for natural riches.\u201d\n      --Seneca, Ep., 119.]\n\nnor that we should support ourselves by putting only a little of that\ndrug into our mouths, by which Epimenides took away his appetite and kept\nhimself alive; nor that we should stupidly beget children with our\nfingers or heels, but rather; with reverence be it spoken, that we might\nvoluptuously beget them with our fingers and heels; nor that the body\nshould be without desire and without titillation.  These are ungrateful\nand wicked complaints.  I accept kindly, and with gratitude, what nature\nhas done for me; am well pleased with it, and proud of it.  A man does\nwrong to that great and omnipotent giver to refuse, annul, or disfigure\nhis gift: all goodness himself, he has made everything good:\n\n     \u201cOmnia quae secundum naturam sunt, aestimatione digna sunt.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cAll things that are according to nature are worthy of esteem.\u201d\n      --Cicero, De Fin., iii. 6.]\n\nOf philosophical opinions, I preferably embrace those that are most\nsolid, that is to say, the most human and most our own: my discourse is,\nsuitable to my manners, low and humble: philosophy plays the child, to my\nthinking, when it puts itself upon its Ergos to preach to us that \u2018tis a\nbarbarous alliance to marry the divine with the earthly, the reasonable\nwith the unreasonable, the severe with the indulgent, the honest with the\ndishonest.  That pleasure is a brutish quality, unworthy to be tasted by\na wise man; that the sole pleasure he extracts from the enjoyment of a\nfair young wife is a pleasure of his conscience to perform an action\naccording to order, as to put on his boots for a profitable journey.\nOh, that its followers had no more right, nor nerves, nor vigour in\ngetting their wives\u2019 maidenheads than in its lesson.\n\nThis is not what Socrates says, who is its master and ours: he values, as\nhe ought, bodily pleasure; but he prefers that of the mind as having more\nforce, constancy, facility, variety, and dignity.  This, according to\nhim, goes by no means alone--he is not so fantastic--but only it goes\nfirst; temperance with him is the moderatrix, not the adversary of\npleasure.  Nature is a gentle guide, but not more sweet and gentle than\nprudent and just.\n\n          \u201cIntrandum est in rerum naturam, et penitus,\n          quid ea postulet, pervidendum.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cA man must search into the nature of things, and fully examine\n     what she requires.\u201d--Cicero, De Fin., V. 16.]\n\nI hunt after her foot throughout: we have confounded it with artificial\ntraces; and that academic and peripatetic good, which is \u201cto live\naccording to it,\u201d becomes on this account hard to limit and explain; and\nthat of the Stoics, neighbour to it, which is \u201cto consent to nature.\u201d\n Is it not an error to esteem any actions less worthy, because they are\nnecessary?  And yet they will not take it out of my head, that it is not\na very convenient marriage of pleasure with necessity, with which, says\nan ancient, the gods always conspire.  To what end do we dismember by\ndivorce a building united by so close and brotherly a correspondence?\nLet us, on the contrary, confirm it by mutual offices; let the mind rouse\nand quicken the heaviness of the body, and the body stay and fix the\nlevity of the soul:\n\n     \u201cQui, velut summum bonum, laudat animac naturam, et, tanquam malum,\n     naturam carnis accusat, profectd et animam carnatiter appetit, et\n     carnem carnaliter fugit; quoniam id vanitate sentit humans, non\n     veritate divina.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cHe who commends the nature of the soul as the supreme good, and\n     condemns the nature of the flesh as evil, at once both carnally\n     desires the soul, and carnally flies the flesh, because he feels\n     thus from human vanity, not from divine truth.\u201d\n      --St. Augustin, De Civit.  Dei, xiv.  5.]\n\nIn this present that God has made us, there is nothing unworthy our care;\nwe stand accountable for it even to a hair; and is it not a commission to\nman, to conduct man according to his condition; \u2018tis express, plain, and\nthe very principal one, and the Creator has seriously and strictly\nprescribed it to us.  Authority has power only to work in regard to\nmatters of common judgment, and is of more weight in a foreign language;\ntherefore let us again charge at it in this place:\n\n     \u201cStultitiae proprium quis non dixerit, ignave et contumaciter\n     facere, quae facienda sunt; et alio corpus impellere, alio animum;\n     distrahique inter diversissimos motus?\u201d\n\n     [\u201cWho will not say, that it is the property of folly, slothfully and\n     contumaciously to perform what is to be done, and to bend the body\n     one way and the mind another, and to be distracted betwixt wholly\n     different motions?\u201d--Seneca, Ep., 74.]\n\nTo make this apparent, ask any one, some day, to tell you what whimsies\nand imaginations he put into his pate, upon the account of which he\ndiverted his thoughts from a good meal, and regrets the time he spends in\neating; you will find there is nothing so insipid in all the dishes at\nyour table as this wise meditation of his (for the most part we had\nbetter sleep than wake to the purpose we wake); and that his discourses\nand notions are not worth the worst mess there.  Though they were the\necstasies of Archimedes himself, what then?  I do not here speak of, nor\nmix with the rabble of us ordinary men, and the vanity of the thoughts\nand desires that divert us, those venerable souls, elevated by the ardour\nof devotion and religion, to a constant and conscientious meditation of\ndivine things, who, by the energy of vivid and vehement hope,\nprepossessing the use of the eternal nourishment, the final aim and last\nstep of Christian desires, the sole constant, and incorruptible pleasure,\ndisdain to apply themselves to our necessitous, fluid, and ambiguous\nconveniences, and easily resign to the body the care and use of sensual\nand temporal pasture; \u2018tis a privileged study.  Between ourselves, I have\never observed supercelestial opinions and subterranean manners to be of\nsingular accord.\n\nAEsop, that great man, saw his master piss as he walked: \u201cWhat then,\u201d\n said he, \u201cmust we drop as we run?\u201d  Let us manage our time; there yet\nremains a great deal idle and ill employed.  The mind has not willingly\nother hours enough wherein to do its business, without disassociating\nitself from the body, in that little space it must have for its\nnecessity.  They would put themselves out of themselves, and escape from\nbeing men.  It is folly; instead of transforming themselves into angels,\nthey transform themselves into beasts; instead of elevating, they lay\nthemselves lower.  These transcendental humours affright me, like high\nand inaccessible places; and nothing is hard for me to digest in the life\nof Socrates but his ecstasies and communication with demons; nothing so\nhuman in Plato as that for which they say he was called divine; and of\nour sciences, those seem to be the most terrestrial and low that are\nhighest mounted; and I find nothing so humble and mortal in the life of\nAlexander as his fancies about his immortalisation.  Philotas pleasantly\nquipped him in his answer; he congratulated him by letter concerning the\noracle of Jupiter Ammon, which had placed him amongst the gods: \u201cUpon thy\naccount I am glad of it, but the men are to be pitied who are to live\nwith a man, and to obey him, who exceeds and is not contented with the\nmeasure of a man:\u201d\n\n               \u201cDiis to minorem quod geris, imperas.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cBecause thou carriest thyself lower than the gods, thou rulest.\u201d\n      --Horace, Od., iii. 6, 5.]\n\nThe pretty inscription wherewith the Athenians honoured the entry of\nPompey into their city is conformable to my sense: \u201cBy so much thou art\na god, as thou confessest thee a man.\u201d  \u2018Tis an absolute and, as it were,\na divine perfection, for a man to know how loyally to enjoy his being.\nWe seek other conditions, by reason we do not understand the use of our\nown; and go out of ourselves, because we know not how there to reside.\n\u2018Tis to much purpose to go upon stilts, for, when upon stilts, we must\nyet walk with our legs; and when seated upon the most elevated throne in\nthe world, we are but seated upon our breech.  The fairest lives, in my\nopinion, are those which regularly accommodate themselves to the common\nand human model without miracle, without extravagance.  Old age stands a\nlittle in need of a more gentle treatment.  Let us recommend that to God,\nthe protector of health and wisdom, but let it be gay and sociable:\n\n                   \u201cFrui paratis et valido mihi\n                    Latoe, dones, et precor, integra\n                    Cum mente; nec turpem senectam\n                    Degere, nec Cithara carentem.\u201d\n\n     [\u201cGrant it to me, Apollo, that I may enjoy my possessions in good\n     health; let me be sound in mind; let me not lead a dishonourable\n     old age, nor want the cittern.\u201d--Horace, Od., i. 31, 17.]\n\nOr:\n\n     [\u201cGrant it to me, Apollo, that I may enjoy what I have in good\n     health; let me be sound in body and mind; let me live in honour when\n     old, nor let music be wanting.\u201d]\n\n\n\n\nAPOLOGY:\n[In fact, the first edition of the Essays (Bordeaux, 1580) has very few\nquotations.  These became more numerous in the edition of 1588; but the\nmultitude of classical texts which at times encumber Montaigne\u2019s text,\nonly dates from the posthumous edition of 1595] he had made these\ncollections in the four last years of his life, as an amusement of his\n\u201cidleness.\u201d--Le Clerc.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\npeople in all walks of life.\n\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\u2019s\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\n\n\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\nFoundation\n\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\u2019s EIN or federal tax identification\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Newby\n     Chief Executive and Director\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\n\n\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\nLiterary Archive Foundation\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\nstatus with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\napproach us with offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\n\n\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\nworks.\n\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\n\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\n\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n", "wordCount": 671677, "unigramCount": {
